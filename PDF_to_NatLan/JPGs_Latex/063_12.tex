TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows two distinct processes labeled as "i)" and "ii)".  
- Process "i)" is an isobaric line at constant pressure.  
- Process "ii)" is an isothermal line at constant temperature.  
The graph includes a point labeled "Triple" indicating the triple point of the substance.

TASK 4b  
The equation for heat transfer is given as:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \left( h_1 - h_2 \right) - W_K
\]  
It is noted that \( h_2 = h_g \).  
The temperature \( T_i \) is calculated as:  
\[
T_i = -10^\circ\text{C} = 263.15 \, \text{K}
\]

TASK 4c  
The pressure at state 1 is equal to the pressure at state 2:  
\[
p_1 = p_2
\]  

---

TASK 4e  
The temperature \( T_i \) would decrease because the sublimated water removes heat from the system.
