TASK 4b  
The energy balance for the compressor is considered under isentropic conditions:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_1 - h_3) - \dot{W} = 0
\]  
It is stated that \( p_2 = p_1 \), \( h_4 = h_1 \), and \( S_2 = S_3 \).  

To interpolate \( h_3 \), use \( S_3 \) in the provided tables. The interpolation process is described as follows:  
\[
S_2 = \frac{(2.2688 - 2.25)}{(2.2688 - 2.25)} \cdot (0.9566 - 0.9636) + 0.9636
\]  
This results in \( S_2 = 0.9632 = S_3 \).  

TASK 4c  
The energy balance for the throttle is considered. The temperature at state 2 is given as \( T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C} \), and the mass flow rate is \( \dot{m} = 4 \, \text{kg/h} \).  

It is stated that \( h_1 = h_4 \), \( p_1 = p_2 \), and \( p_2 = 2.2688 \, \text{bar} = p_1 \).  

The temperature at state 4 is given as \( T_4 = 15.45^\circ\text{C} \). From the tables, the enthalpy at state 4 is:  
\[
h_4 = 63.53 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
Thus, \( h_4 = 63.53 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).
