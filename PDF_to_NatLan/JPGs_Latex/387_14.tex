TASK 1d  
The heat released during cooling from state 1 to state 2 is calculated using the energy balance.  

The mean temperature of the coolant is given as:  
\[
\bar{T}_{\text{KF}} = 255 \, \text{K}
\]

The heat flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_R}{\bar{T}_{\text{Reactor}}} + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{\bar{T}_{\text{KF}}}
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 0.08827 \, \text{kW/s}
\]

Entropy production is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_R}{T_{\text{Reactor}}} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}}
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 638 \, \text{J/K} \, \text{s}
\]

TASK 1e  
The mass of saturated liquid water added to reduce the temperature from \(100^\circ\text{C}\) to \(70^\circ\text{C}\) is calculated using the energy balance:  

The heat released during cooling is:  
\[
Q_{R,12} = Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \, \text{MJ}
\]

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
m_2 h_2 + m_1 h_1 = \Delta m h_f(20^\circ\text{C}) + Q_{R,12}
\]

Rearranging:  
\[
(m_1 + \Delta m) u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m h_f(20^\circ\text{C})
\]

Solving for \( \Delta m \):  
\[
\Delta m = \frac{m_1 u_1 - m_2 u_2}{h_{f,12} - h_f}
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta m = 3.668088 \, \text{kg}
\]

The specific internal energy values used are:  
\[
u_1 = 419.94 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
\[
u_2 = 292.58 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
\[
h_f = 83.96 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
