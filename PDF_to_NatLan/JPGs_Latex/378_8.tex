The pressure \( p = p_{\text{amb}} = 1 \, \text{bar} \), and the heat transfer \( Q = 15000 \, \text{J} \).  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} \cdot \Delta u + \dot{Q}_{12} - \dot{W}
\]  
Here, kinetic and potential energy terms are neglected.  

The change in energy \( \Delta E \) is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \text{constant} \cdot |\dot{Q}_{12}|
\]  

The heat transfer per unit mass is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta u \cdot m_{12} = |\dot{Q}_{12}| = 15000 \, \text{J} \implies \Delta u = \text{constant}
\]  

The entropy change is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta s = \text{constant} \cdot \Delta u
\]  

The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is determined using the equation:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = x_{\text{phase}} + \Delta x - \Delta u = 0.04 \implies x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.9330 = 1 - x_{\text{liquid}}
\]  

The equation for entropy change is written as:  
\[
\Delta s = \frac{u_{\text{final}}(1 \, \text{bar}) - u_{\text{initial}}(1 \, \text{bar})}{\text{constant}}
\]  

Below the text, two small sketches are visible:  
- The first sketch shows a phase diagram labeled "Phase" with arrows pointing to "Ice" and "Liquid."  
- The second sketch shows a pressure-volume diagram labeled "P-V" with arrows indicating changes in pressure and volume.  

Both diagrams are rough and appear to illustrate the transitions between states.
