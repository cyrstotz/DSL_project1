TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn with pressure \( P \, [\text{bar}] \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \, [\text{K}] \) on the horizontal axis. The graph represents a phase diagram, including the triple point labeled as "Tripelpunkt." Two processes are marked:  
1. A horizontal arrow pointing left, labeled "i," indicating a cooling process.  
2. A vertical arrow pointing upward, labeled "ii," indicating a pressure increase.  

TASK 4b  
The text "Energiebilanz am Verdichter" (Energy balance at the compressor) is partially crossed out. Below this, a table and equations are provided:  

1. \( s_2 = s_3 \)  
2. \( x_2 = 1 \)  

For state 3:  
\( s_2 = s_3 \), \( 8 \, \text{bar} \).  

TASK 4  
A table is drawn with columns labeled \( P \), \( T \), \( s \), \( h \), and \( x \). The rows contain the following data:  

1. \( P = 1.2132 \)  
2. \( T = -22^\circ\text{C} \)  
3. \( P = 8 \, \text{bar} \)  
4. \( P = 8 \, \text{bar}, T = 81.33, s = 0.3458, h = 83.42 \), \( x_4 = 0 \).  

Processes are described as follows:  
- \( x_2 = 1 \): Isobaric process.  
- \( x_4 = 0 \): Isobaric process.
