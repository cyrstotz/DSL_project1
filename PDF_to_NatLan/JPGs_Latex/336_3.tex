TASK 3b  
The temperature of the gas and the ice-water mixture (EW) is equal in state 2 because \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), meaning there is still ice present. Therefore, \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \).

The pressure of the gas in state 2 is approximately \( p_{g,2} = 740 - 744 \, \text{Pa} \approx 744 \, \text{Pa} \), as the forces from inside and outside the system are equal. This corresponds to an isobaric expansion.

TASK 3c  
The energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i (u + \frac{w^2}{2} + gz) + \sum \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}
\]  
For the change in energy:  
\[
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = \sum Q - \sum W
\]  
The internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
E = U + ke + pe \approx U
\]  
Thus:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = U_2 - U_1
\]  
The change in internal energy is calculated as:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = C_V (T_2 - T_1) = Q - W_V
\]  

For the volume work:  
\[
W_V = \int_{V_1}^{V_2} p \, dV = p_g (V_2 - V_1) = 285.83 \, \text{J}
\]  

The volume \( V_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m_g R T}{p} = 0.0011 \, \text{m}^3
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q = C_V (0^\circ\text{C} - (500^\circ\text{C} + 273.15^\circ\text{C})) - 285.83 \, \text{J}
\]  
This results in:  
\[
Q = -775.23 \, \text{J}
\]
