TASK 3b  
The ratio of specific heats \( \kappa \) is calculated as:  
\[
\kappa = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = \frac{0.7933}{0.633} = 1.263
\]  

The volume \( V \) becomes smaller, the pressure \( p \) becomes larger, and since the gas loses heat, the temperature \( T \) decreases.  

The temperature \( T_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
T_2 = 773 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{p_x}{1.5} \right) = 773 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.26}{1.26} \right)
\]

TASK 3c  
The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is to be determined.  

The final gas temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is given as \( 0.003^\circ \text{C} \).  

The heat transfer equation is:  
\[
Q_{12} = \Delta h_{12} = c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 0.7933 \cdot (0.003 - 500) = -389.65 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

Note: The equation \( Q_{12} = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \) is crossed out and not used.
