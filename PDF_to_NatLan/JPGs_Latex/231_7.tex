TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x = \frac{h - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
where \( h \) represents the specific enthalpy.

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is given by:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
The diagram shows a schematic representation of the refrigeration cycle, with arrows indicating heat flow and work input. The value \( \dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{W} \) is noted.

TASK 4e  
The water would freeze again and continue to cool further.
