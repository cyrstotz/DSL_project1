The page contains calculations and equations related to energy balance and entropy. Below is the transcription:

---

Energy balance equation:
\[
\dot{m} \cdot (h_3 - h_2) + W_u = 0
\]

Rearranged to solve for mass flow rate:
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{W_u}{h_2 - h_3}
\]

From state 4 to state 1, entropy is constant:
\[
s_4 (x = 0, \, 8 \, \text{bar}) = 0.2419
\]

Entropy at state 4 is expressed as:
\[
s_{4u} = s_3 = s_{3,F} + x \cdot (s_{3,g} - s_{3,F})
\]

Steam quality \( x \) is calculated as:
\[
x = \frac{s_4 - s_{3,F}}{s_{3,g} - s_{3,F}}
\]

Enthalpy at state 3 is given by:
\[
h_3 = h_{3,F} + x \cdot (h_{3,g} - h_{3,F})
\]

Substituting \( x \) into the enthalpy equation:
\[
h_3 = h_{3,F} + \left( \frac{s_4 - s_{3,F}}{s_{3,g} - s_{3,F}} \right) \cdot (h_{3,g} - h_{3,F})
\]
