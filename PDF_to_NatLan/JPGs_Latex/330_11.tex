TASK 4a  
Energy balance for the heat exchanger in the refrigeration cycle is described.  

A diagram is drawn showing a rectangular heat exchanger with arrows indicating heat flow \( \dot{Q}_K \) and the refrigerant R134a flowing through it. The heat exchanger is outlined in orange, and the heat flow is labeled with a blue arrow pointing downward.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
SFP: 0 = \dot{m}_R [h_1 - h_2] + \dot{Q}_K
\]  

Further explanation of energy transfer in the heat exchanger is provided.  

Another diagram is drawn, similar to the first, showing heat flow \( \dot{Q}_K \) and labeled arrows.  

The equation for heat transfer is given as:  
\[
Q = m(s_2 - s_A) = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{T_i} - \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{T_{ii}}
\]  

The heat flow \( \dot{Q}_K \) is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = m(s_2 - s_A) \cdot (-T_{ii} + T_{i})
\]  

A crossed-out equation is visible but ignored per instructions.  

The refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_R \) is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m}_R = \frac{-\dot{Q}_K}{h_1 - h_2}
\]
