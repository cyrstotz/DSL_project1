TASK 3c  
The temperature \( T_{3/2} \) is given as \( 0.003^\circ\text{C} \), which is converted to Kelvin:  
\[
T_{3/2} = 273.153 \, \text{K}.
\]

The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q_{12} - W_{12}.
\]

The change in internal energy is:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12} - W_{12}.
\]

Using the specific heat capacity of the gas:  
\[
m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = Q_{12} - W_{12}.
\]

The work done by the gas is calculated as:  
\[
W_{12} = m_g \cdot p_{31} \cdot \Delta v = p_{31} \cdot (V_{g,2} - V_{g,1}) \cdot m_g.
\]

The volume \( V_{g,2} \) is determined using the ideal gas law:  
\[
V_{g,2} = \frac{m_g}{\rho_{g,2}} = \frac{m_g \cdot R}{M_g \cdot T_{g,2}}.
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
V_{g,2} = \frac{m_g \cdot R}{M_g \cdot T_{g,2}} = 0.0011 \, \text{m}^3.
\]

The work \( W_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
W_{12} = -284.2 \, \text{J} \cdot 0.00334212 \, \text{kg} = -972.33 \, \text{J}.
\]

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = W_{12} + m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = -2055.116 \, \text{J}.
