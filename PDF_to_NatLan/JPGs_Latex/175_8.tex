TASK 4a  
The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph. It shows the phase regions with a curve labeled "Trippel" (triple point). The graph includes two processes:  
- An isothermal process labeled "isotherm."  
- An isobaric process labeled "isobar."  
The states 1 and 2 are marked along the curve, indicating transitions between phases.

TASK 4b  
The process from state 2 to state 3 involves an adiabatic compressor. The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_K \) is zero, and the system is stationary.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} \left[ h + \frac{k e}{2} + p e \right] + \dot{Q}_K - \sum \dot{W}_u
\]  
Simplified to:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] - \dot{W}_u
\]  
Rearranged to find the mass flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_u}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

Given:  
\[
\dot{m}_R = 4 \, \text{kg/s}, \quad T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C}
\]
