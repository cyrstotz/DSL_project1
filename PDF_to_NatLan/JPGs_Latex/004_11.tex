TASK 3c  
The following equations are written to calculate the transferred heat or related variables:

\[
63.53 = 79.82 \left(1 - x\right) + \frac{227.32 \, x}{241.24}
\]

\[
43.67 = 227.32 \, x
\]

Solving for \( x \), the result is:

\[
x = 0.1937
\]  

Note: Some intermediate steps or values are crossed out and therefore ignored.
