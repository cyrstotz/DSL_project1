TASK 2a  
The page contains a diagram and equations related to thermodynamic processes in a jet engine.

### Diagram Description:
The diagram is a \( T \)-\( s \) (temperature-entropy) plot.  
- The x-axis is labeled \( s \) (entropy) with units \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  
- The y-axis is labeled \( T \) (temperature) with units \( K \).  
- The plot shows a series of processes labeled numerically from 0 to 6.  
  - Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are connected by curves and straight lines.  
  - The curves represent isentropic and isobaric processes.  
  - Dashed lines indicate constant pressure lines.  
  - The transitions between states are consistent with the thermodynamic processes described in jet engine operation.  

### Equations:
1. The energy balance equation for the jet engine process:  
   \[
   \dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a + \frac{1}{2} w_e^2 - \frac{1}{2} w_a^2 \right) = 0
   \]  
   where \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate, \( h_e \) and \( h_a \) are specific enthalpies at the exit and inlet, and \( w_e \) and \( w_a \) are velocities at the exit and inlet.

2. The specific enthalpy difference:  
   \[
   h_a - h_e = c_p (T_2 - T_1) = 1.006 (T_6 - T_5)
   \]  
   where \( c_p \) is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, and \( T_2, T_1, T_6, T_5 \) are temperatures at respective states.

3. A given condition:  
   \[
   T_6 = T_5 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}
   \]  
   This indicates the pressure at state 6 is equal to the ambient pressure.
