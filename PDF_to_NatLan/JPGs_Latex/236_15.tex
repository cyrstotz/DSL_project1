TASK 2c  
The change in flow exergy is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta ex = ex_6 - ex_0 = 110065.5 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

TASK 2d  
**Exergy Balance:**  
The exergy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{d\dot{Ex}}{dt}^{0, \text{stat}} = \sum_i \dot{E}_{\text{str},i} + \sum_j \dot{E}_{\text{Q},j} - \sum_n \left( \dot{W}_n(t) - p_0 \frac{dV(t)}{dt} \right) - \dot{Ex}_{\text{vel}}
\]  
Here, the system is assumed to be adiabatic, and no external work is performed.

**Exergy Flow Rate:**  
The exergy flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Ex}_{\text{vel}} = \dot{E}_{\text{str}} - \dot{W}
\]  
It is noted that no external work is performed ("nach au√üen keine Arbeit").

**Specific Exergy Flow:**  
The specific exergy flow is given by:  
\[
\frac{\dot{Ex}_{\text{vel}}}{\dot{m}_{\text{gas}}} = \frac{\dot{E}_{\text{str}}}{\dot{m}_{\text{gas}}}
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
\dot{e}_{\text{vel}} = e_{\text{str}} = 100 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
