TASK 3c  
The equation for energy balance is given as:  
\[
Q = \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  
The work done is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{W} = \int_{1}^{2} p \, dv = p_{\text{avg}} \cdot (V_2 - V_1)
\]

TASK 3d  
The pressure in the gas phase remains constant:  
\[
p_{\text{g}} = p_{\text{z,g}}
\]  
The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{E} = U
\]  
The change in energy is:  
\[
\Delta E = U_2 - U_1 = Q - W
\]
