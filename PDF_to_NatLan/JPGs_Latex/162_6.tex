TASK 2a  
The page contains mathematical derivations and diagrams related to jet engine exergy analysis. Below is the transcription of visible content:

### Mathematical Derivations:
1. The equation appears to involve terms for velocity and energy balance:
   \[
   \frac{z_2}{2m} - \frac{z_2}{2m} + \left( \frac{w_5^2}{2} \right) m - \left( \frac{w_1}{2} \right) m - (q_1 - q_1) d = \ldots
   \]
   Followed by:
   \[
   (q_1 + (0.5 - 0.5) q_1 - q_4 - q_4) = 45 \, ex.
   \]

2. Another equation involving velocity and energy terms:
   \[
   \sqrt{5m \cdot 800z} = \ldots
   \]

3. A rearranged form of the energy equation:
   \[
   (q_1 - q_1) d - z_2 = 10
   \]
   And:
   \[
   (q_1 - q_1) d - z_2 = \frac{z_2}{2m} - \frac{z_2}{2m}
   \]

4. Final derivation:
   \[
   \frac{z_2}{2m} - \frac{z_2}{2m} + (q_4 - q_4) m - \frac{w_1}{2} m = 0
   \]

### Diagrams:
Two diagrams are present at the bottom of the page. They appear to be qualitative representations of thermodynamic processes in a jet engine:

1. **Left Diagram**:  
   - A graph with axes labeled \( s \) (entropy) and \( T \) (temperature).  
   - The diagram includes curves representing isobars and a process path labeled \( 1 \) and \( 5 \).  
   - A dashed line connects points, indicating a transition or mixing process.  

2. **Right Diagram**:  
   - Similar axes labeled \( s \) and \( T \).  
   - Curves represent thermodynamic states, with points labeled \( 1 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \).  
   - A bold curve indicates a process path, and arrows show the direction of transitions.  

Both diagrams qualitatively depict the jet engine cycle, with entropy and temperature changes during compression, combustion, and expansion phases.

TASK 2b  
The derivations and diagrams are consistent with the jet engine exergy analysis, focusing on velocity, energy balance, and entropy-temperature relationships.
