TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn with pressure \( P \, [\text{bar}] \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \, [\text{K}] \) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts the phase regions of a substance, including solid, fluid, and gas phases.  
- Point 3 is marked in the gas region.  
- Point 2 is marked in the fluid region.  
- Point 1 is marked in the solid region.  
Arrows indicate transitions between these states.  

TASK 4b  
The refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_R \) is given by:  
\[
\dot{m}_R = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{w_{23,\text{rev}}}
\]  
The reversible work \( w_{23,\text{rev}} \) is expressed as:  
\[
w_{23,\text{rev}} = -\int_{1}^{2} p \, dv
\]  

TASK 4c  
The entropy of the refrigerant at state \( u \) is equal to the entropy at state \( f \):  
\[
s_u = s_f
\]  
The entropy at \( s_u \) for a pressure of 8 bar is given as:  
\[
s_u (8 \, \text{bar}) = 0.9066 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  
The vapor quality \( x_u \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_u = \frac{s_u - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]  
Where \( s_f \) and \( s_g \) represent the entropy values for the saturated liquid and saturated vapor, respectively.
