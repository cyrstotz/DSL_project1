The page contains calculations related to thermodynamic properties and energy balances. The following equations and values are visible:

1. \( h_g(2,2686 \, \text{bar}) = h_2 - 243,169 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)
   - This appears to be a calculation for enthalpy at a given pressure.

2. \( \dot{m}(h_3 - h_2) = \dot{W}_K \)
   - This equation represents the energy balance, where \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate, \( h_3 \) and \( h_2 \) are specific enthalpies, and \( \dot{W}_K \) is the work rate.

3. \( \dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3} \)
   - Rearranged to solve for the mass flow rate.

4. \( s_2(2,2686 \, \text{bar}) = s_g = 0,9232 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)
   - This equation calculates entropy at a specific pressure.

5. \( s_2 - s_3 \)
   - Indicates a difference in entropy between two states.

6. \( h_3(8 \, \text{bar}, 0,9232 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}) \)
   - Specific enthalpy at a given pressure and entropy.

7. \( h_3 = 264,415 + \frac{273,66 - 264,415}{0,9374 - 0,9066}(0,9232 - 0,9066) \)
   - A linear interpolation formula to calculate \( h_3 \).

8. \( h_3 = 269,276 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)
   - Result of the interpolation.

9. \( \dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3} = 3,18 \, \text{kg/s} \)
   - Final calculation for mass flow rate.
