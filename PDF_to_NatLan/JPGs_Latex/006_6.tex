TASK 4a  
Draw the diagram.

TASK 4b  
The energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K
\]  
Rearranging for the mass flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{28 \, \text{W}}{(h_2 - h_3)}
\]  
The enthalpy \( h_2 \) is to be determined.

---

TASK 4c  
The energy balance equation for this step is:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_4 - h_1)
\]  
It is noted that \( h_4 = h_1 \).  
The enthalpy \( h_4 \) is given as:  
\[
h_4 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} = h_1
\]  
The value \( 93.42 \) is confirmed.
