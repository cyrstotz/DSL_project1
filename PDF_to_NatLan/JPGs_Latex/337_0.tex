TASK 1a  
The reactor operates in steady-state conditions. The mass flow rate entering the reactor is \( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \), and the mass flow rate leaving the reactor is \( \dot{m}_{\text{out}} \). The reactor mass is constant at \( m_{\text{total}} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \), and the steam quality is \( x_D = 0.005 \). Heat is released by the chemical reaction (\( \dot{Q}_R \)) and removed via the cooling jacket.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} h_1 - \dot{m}_{\text{out}} h_2 + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}}
\]  
Since the system is stationary and adiabatic to the surroundings, \( \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}} = 0 \).  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_1) + \dot{Q}_R
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{m} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s}, \quad h_2 = 419.04 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad h_1 = 292.98 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad \dot{Q}_R = 100 \, \text{kW}
\]  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \cdot (419.04 - 292.98) + 100 \, \text{kW}
\]  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 37.818 \, \text{kW} + 100 \, \text{kW} = 137.818 \, \text{kW}
\]  

The enthalpy values \( h_2 \) and \( h_1 \) are taken from saturated liquid water tables at \( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \) and \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \), respectively:  
\[
h_2 = 419.04 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad h_1 = 292.98 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant, \( T_{\text{KF}} \), is determined using the equation:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int T \, dS}{S_a - S_e}
\]  
For an ideal liquid, this simplifies to:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\dot{Q}}{c_{\text{p}} \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_2 = 288.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_1 = 298.15 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{\ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)}
\]  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{288.15 - 298.15}{\ln \left( \frac{288.15}{298.15} \right)}
\]  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = 293.1216 \, \text{K}
\]  

This represents the thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant during heat transfer.
