TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{G,1} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
p_{G,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{M_{\text{Kolben}} \cdot g}{\pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2} + \frac{m_{\text{EW}} \cdot g}{\pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2}
\]  
The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is determined as:  
\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2 = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
p_{G,1} = \frac{32 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2}{0.00785 \, \text{m}^2} + \frac{0.1 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2}{0.00785 \, \text{m}^2} = 140090 \, \text{Pa} = 1.40 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The mass of the gas \( m_{G,1} \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{G,1} \cdot V_{G,1} = m_{G,1} \cdot R_G \cdot T_{G,1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad m_{G,1} = \frac{p_{G,1} \cdot V_{G,1}}{R_G \cdot T_{G,1}}
\]  
The specific gas constant \( R_G \) is given as:  
\[
R_G = \frac{R}{M_G} = 166.3 \, \text{J/(kgÂ·K)}
\]  
The gas volume \( V_{G,1} \) is converted from liters to cubic meters:  
\[
V_{G,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L} = 0.00314 \, \text{m}^3
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
m_{G,1} = 0.00342 \, \text{kg} = 3.42 \, \text{g}
\]  

TASK 3b  
This section is crossed out and therefore ignored.  

The remaining explanation states:  
The temperature and pressure remain constant:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},2} = T_{\text{EW},1} = 0^\circ \text{C}
\]  
\[
p_{G,2} = p_{G,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{M_{\text{Kolben}} \cdot g}{\pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2}
\]  
This is because the system operates in a two-phase region. Heat input leads to melting of ice without a change in temperature or pressure, as long as \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \).  

The temperature remains at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) because the ice is not completely melted, and the temperature of the ice-water mixture remains constant. No heat transfer occurs when \( T_{G,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0 \).  

The pressure also remains constant because the atmospheric pressure, the weight of the piston, and the ice-water mixture remain unchanged.
