TASK 3c  
The task involves calculating the heat transferred (\( Q_{12} \)) from the gas to the ice-water mixture between states 1 and 2.

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q - W
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
\Delta U = Q - W
\]  

The change in internal energy (\( \Delta U \)) is calculated using the specific heat capacity (\( c_V \)) and the temperature difference:  
\[
\Delta U = c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}, \quad T_1 = 500 \, \text{K}, \quad T_2 = 273.153 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
\Delta U = 0.633 \cdot (273.153 - 500)
\]  
\[
\Delta U = -143.59 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The work (\( W \)) is calculated using the pressure-volume relationship:  
\[
W = p_{\text{amb}} (V_2 - V_1)
\]  
The ambient pressure is:  
\[
p_{\text{amb}} = 1.10^5 \, \text{Pa}
\]  

The volume at state 2 (\( V_2 \)) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{\dot{m} R T_2}{p_2}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{m} = 3.6 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg}, \quad R = 166.28 \, \text{J/kg·K}, \quad T_2 = 273.153 \, \text{K}, \quad p_2 = 1.15 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{Pa}
\]  
\[
V_2 = \frac{3.6 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 166.28 \cdot 273.153}{1.15 \cdot 10^5}
\]  
\[
V_2 = 0.001009 \, \text{m}^3
\]  

The volume at state 1 (\( V_1 \)) is given as:  
\[
V_1 = 3.14 \, \text{L} = 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3
\]  

Substituting into the work equation:  
\[
W = 1.10^5 \cdot (0.001009 - 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3})
\]  
\[
W = -204.99 \, \text{J}
\]  

Finally, the heat transferred (\( Q \)) is calculated as:  
\[
Q = \Delta U + W
\]  
\[
Q = -143.59 \, \text{kJ} + (-204.99 \, \text{J})
\]  
\[
Q = -143.799 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The calculation ends with a question mark, possibly indicating uncertainty or incomplete reasoning.
