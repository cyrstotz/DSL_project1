TASK 4a  
The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph illustrating a thermodynamic cycle. The cycle consists of four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The processes between these states are as follows:  
- From state 1 to state 2: Isentropic process.  
- From state 2 to state 3: Isobaric process.  
- From state 3 to state 4: Isentropic process.  
- From state 4 back to state 1: Isobaric process.  

The graph also includes annotations for "Isotherm" and "ND" (possibly indicating a specific region or point of interest).

TASK 4b  
The first law of thermodynamics is applied to the system. The equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_2 \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) + \dot{Q}_K - \dot{W}_K
\]  
where \( S_2 = S_3 \).  

Additional notes:  
- \( h_2 = h_{fg} \) because \( x = 1 \).  
- A temperature range is provided but partially crossed out:  
  \[
  T_1 = 288.15 \, \text{K}, \, T_2 = 271.45 \, \text{K}.
  \]  

No further explanation is provided for the calculations.
