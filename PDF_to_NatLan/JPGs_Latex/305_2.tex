TASK 2a  
Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. **T-s Diagram**:  
   - The diagram shows temperature (\( T \)) on the vertical axis and entropy (\( s \)) on the horizontal axis.  
   - Several isobaric lines are labeled, including \( 0.13 \, \text{bar} \).  
   - The process path is marked with points \( 0 \), \( 1 \), and \( 2 \).  
   - The path from \( 0 \) to \( 1 \) is labeled as "isentropic," and the path from \( 1 \) to \( 2 \) is labeled as "isobaric."  

2. **T-s Diagram with Additional States**:  
   - This diagram also shows temperature (\( T \)) on the vertical axis and entropy (\( s \)) on the horizontal axis.  
   - Several isobaric lines are labeled, including \( 0.019 \, \text{bar} \).  
   - The process path includes points \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2k \), \( 3k \), \( 4k \), and \( 5 \).  
   - The path from \( 0 \) to \( 1 \) is labeled as "isentropic," and the path from \( 1 \) to \( 2k \) is labeled as "isobaric."  
   - Additional paths are labeled "isentropic" and "isobaric" between other points.

TASK 2b  
The following equations and calculations are provided:  

1. The energy balance equation for the nozzle:  
   \[
   h_5 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} = h_6 + \frac{w_6^2}{2}
   \]

2. Assumption: The nozzle is isentropic (\( s_5 = s_6 \)), and \( n = k = 1.4 \).  

3. Calculation of \( T_6 \):  
   \[
   T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{k-1}{k}} = 431.9 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.191 \, \text{bar}}{0.5 \, \text{bar}} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
   \]

4. Rearranging the energy balance equation:  
   \[
   \frac{w_6^2}{2} = h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2}{2}
   \]

5. Substituting values:  
   \[
   h_5 = c_p (T_5 - T_6) + \frac{w_5^2}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} (431.9 - 328.07) + \frac{(220 \, \text{m/s})^2}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 104.45 \, \text{kJ} + 24.2 \, \text{kJ} = 128.65 \, \text{kJ}
   \]

6. Solving for \( w_6 \):  
   \[
   w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot 128.65 \, \text{kJ}} = 507.29 \, \text{m/s}
   \]  

The final result for \( w_6 \) is boxed:  
\[
w_6 = 507.29 \, \text{m/s}
\]
