TASK 3d  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = m_{g,2} u_{g,2} - m_{g,1} u_{g,1} + \Delta GPE = 0
\]  
The gravitational potential energy (\( \Delta GPE \)) term is crossed out, simplifying to:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q - W = \Delta E
\]  
Since \( W = 0 \), the equation becomes:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q
\]  

The temperature of the equilibrium state is given as:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0.003^\circ \text{C} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  

The energy of the ice-water mixture in state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
E_1 = m_{\text{EW}} (u_{\text{ice}} + x u_{\text{water}}) = (-333.458 \, \text{kJ/kg} \cdot 0.6 \, \text{kg} + 0.003 \, \text{kJ/kg} \cdot 0.4 \, \text{kg})
\]  

The energy of water in state 1 is:  
\[
E_{1,\text{wasser}} = -20.00028 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The energy of water in state 2 is expressed as:  
\[
E_{2,\text{wasser}} = u_f(T = 0.003^\circ \text{C}) \cdot (1 - x) + u_{\text{ice}}(T = 0.003^\circ \text{C}) \cdot x
\]  

The change in energy for the gas is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta E_{\text{gas}} = E_{2,\text{gas}} - E_{1,\text{gas}} = m (u_{2,\text{gas}} - u_{1,\text{gas}}) = c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta E_{\text{gas}} = P_{12} = -1500.9 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The energy of water in state 2 is expressed as:  
\[
E_{2,\text{wasser}} = Q_{12} - \Delta E_{\text{gas}} + E_{1,\text{wasser}} = u_f - x u_f + u_{\text{ice}} x
\]  

The final ice fraction \( x \) is determined using:  
\[
x = \frac{Q - \Delta E_{\text{gas}} + E_{1,\text{wasser}} - u_f}{u_{\text{ice}} - u_f}
\]  

A diagram is drawn showing the relationship between \( u_{\text{ice}} - u_f \) and \( u_f \). The arrow indicates the subtraction of \( u_f \) from \( u_{\text{ice}} \).
