TASK 3a  
The gas constant \( R_g \) is calculated as:  
\[
R_g = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g} = \frac{8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}}{50 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.166 \, \text{J/g·K} = 166 \, \text{J/kg·K}.
\]

The pressure-volume relationship for the gas is expressed as:  
\[
p_{g,1} V_{g,1} = R_g m_g T_{g,1}.
\]

The equilibrium pressure equation is given as:  
\[
p_{\text{EW,1}} + p_{g,1} = \frac{m_g}{\pi \frac{D^2}{4}} + p_{\text{amb}}.
\]

TASK 3b  
The temperature and pressure of the gas in state 2 are equal to those of the ice-water mixture:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW,2}},
\]
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{\text{EW,2}}.
\]
