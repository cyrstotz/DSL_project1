TASK 1d  
The problem involves calculating the mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) of saturated liquid water added to the reactor during cooling from state 1 to state 2 using an energy balance.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_{\text{in}} + Q_{\text{out}}
\]  

Rearranging the equation to isolate \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{12} h_{\text{in}} - (\Delta m_{12} u_2) = m_1 u_1 + Q_{\text{out}} - m_2 u_2
\]  

Simplifying further:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} (h_{\text{in}} - u_2) = m_1 u_1 - Q_{\text{out}} + u_2 m_2
\]  

Thus, \( \Delta m_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_1 u_1 - Q_{\text{out}} + u_2 m_2}{h_{\text{in}} - u_2}
\]  

Values for specific enthalpy and internal energy are provided from water tables:  
\[
h_{\text{in}} = 83.96 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(Table A-2 at \( 20^\circ\text{C} \))}  
\]  
\[
u_1 = 418.94 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(Table A-2 at \( 100^\circ\text{C} \))}  
\]  
\[
u_2 = 292.55 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(Table A-2 at \( 20^\circ\text{C} \))}  
\]  

The heat released during cooling is given as:  
\[
Q_{\text{out}} = -35 \, \text{MJ}
\]  

These values will be substituted into the equation to calculate \( \Delta m_{12} \).
