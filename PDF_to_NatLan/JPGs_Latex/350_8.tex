TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) (in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in degrees Celsius) on the horizontal axis. The curve represents the relationship between \( p \) and \( T \), with a labeled region indicating "ND" (likely referring to a phase region). The graph suggests that \( p \) and \( T \) are correlated.  

Below the main graph, a smaller sketch labeled "PVT" is drawn, showing a three-dimensional representation of pressure \( p \), volume \( V \), and temperature \( T \).  

TASK 4b  
The temperature during evaporation is given as:  
\[
T_{\text{evaporation}} = T_i - 6 \, \text{K}
\]  

The process is described as adiabatic and reversible, which is isentropic. Therefore:  
\[
S_3 = S_1
\]  

TASK 4e  
The crossed-out text suggests that the temperature would rise again because the cooling cycle adds heat. However, since the text is crossed out, it is not considered part of the transcription.
