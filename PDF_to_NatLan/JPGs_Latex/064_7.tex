TASK 2a  
The page contains two diagrams related to thermodynamic processes.  

1. **First Diagram (labeled "a")**:  
   - The graph is a qualitative representation of a thermodynamic process in a \( p \)-\( v \) diagram.  
   - The vertical axis is labeled \( p \) (pressure), and the horizontal axis is labeled \( v \) (specific volume).  
   - Several curves are drawn, with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - The process appears to involve multiple transitions between states, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
   - The curves suggest changes in pressure and specific volume, possibly representing compression, expansion, or other thermodynamic transformations.  

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - The graph is a \( p \)-\( v \) diagram with the vertical axis labeled \( p \) (pressure) and the horizontal axis labeled \( v \) (specific volume).  
   - The diagram shows a closed cycle with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - The cycle includes arrows indicating the direction of the process, suggesting a thermodynamic cycle such as a Carnot or Rankine cycle.  
   - The curve transitions between states, with pressure and specific volume changing throughout the cycle.
