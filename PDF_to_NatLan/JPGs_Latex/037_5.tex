TASK 4a  
The diagram shows a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph. It includes a phase diagram with a curved boundary separating different phase regions. The boundary line is labeled with a wavy pattern, indicating phase transitions. The axes are labeled as follows:
- \(p\) (pressure) on the vertical axis.
- \(T\) (temperature) on the horizontal axis.
Another smaller graph is drawn to the right, showing a simplified \(p\)-\(T\) relationship with linear axes labeled \(p\) (in \(\text{bar}\)) and \(T\) (in \(\text{K}\)).

TASK 4b  
The condition \(T_1 < T_i\) is stated.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] + \dot{W}_K
\]

The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{-\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_5 - h_2}
\]

The entropy condition is given as:  
\[
s_3 = s_2 \quad (\text{reversible adiabatic + isentropic})
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance (\(\epsilon_K\)) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\left| \dot{Q}_K \right|}{\left| \dot{W}_K \right|} = \frac{\left| \dot{Q}_1 \right|}{\left| \dot{W}_K \right|}
\]

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left( h_1 - h_2 \right) + \dot{Q}_K
\]

Rearranging, the heat transfer rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = -\dot{m} \cdot \left( h_2 - h_1 \right)
\]
