TASK 2a  
The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) plot representing the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. It includes labeled points for states \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The process transitions are described as follows:  
- From \( 1 \) to \( 2 \): Isentropic compression.  
- From \( 2 \) to \( 3 \): Isobaric heat addition.  
- From \( 3 \) to \( 5 \): Adiabatic expansion.  
- From \( 5 \) to \( 6 \): Isobaric mixing at \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- From \( 6 \): Isobaric nozzle exit at \( 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  

The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (specific entropy), with units indicated.

TASK 2b  
The outlet temperature \( T_6 \) and velocity \( w_6 \) are calculated as follows:  

1. The entropy at state \( 5 \) equals the entropy at state \( 6 \):  
\[
s_5 = s_6
\]

2. Using the enthalpy at state \( 5 \):  
\[
h_5 = h(431.9 \, \text{K}, 0.5 \, \text{bar})  
\]
From Table A22 (interpolation):  
\[
h_5 = 431.61 - 431.93 \quad \text{(values between 440 and 430)}  
\]
Interpolating:  
\[
h_5 = 431.43 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

3. For isentropic relations:  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}  
\]
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}  
\]
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}}  
\]
\[
T_6 = 338.675 \, \text{K}
\]

4. Energy balance for velocity:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(h_5 - h_6) + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2}  
\]
\[
w_6^2 = 2 \dot{m}(h_5 - h_6) + w_5^2  
\]
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 \dot{m}(h_5 - h_6) + w_5^2}  
\]

Using \( h_6 \):  
\[
h_6 = h(338.675 \, \text{K})  
\]
Interpolating from Table A22:  
\[
h_6 = 330.94 - 325.31 \quad \text{(values between 330 and 325)}  
\]
\[
h_6 = 328.16 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

Final velocity:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 (433.43 - 328.16) + 220^2}  
\]
\[
w_6 = 508.26 \, \text{m/s}
\]
