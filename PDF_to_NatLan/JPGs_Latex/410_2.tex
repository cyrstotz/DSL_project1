TASK 2a  
The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( S \) plot representing the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine.  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) [K] (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( S \) [kJ/K] (entropy in kilojoules per Kelvin).  
- The process begins at point 1 and follows an isentropic compression to point 2.  
- From point 2 to point 3, there is heat addition at constant pressure.  
- From point 3 to point 4, the process involves isentropic expansion.  
- From point 4 to point 5, there is heat rejection at constant pressure.  
- The nozzle process from point 5 to point 6 is labeled as "isentropic."  

TASK 2b  
To calculate \( w_6 \) and \( T_6 \):  

The entropy at states 5 and 6 is equal:  
\[
S_5 = S_6
\]

The entropy change is expressed as:  
\[
0 = \Delta S = \int_{T_5}^{T_6} \frac{c_p^{\text{air}}(T)}{T} \, dT - R \ln \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)
\]

Simplifying:  
\[
0 = c_p^{\text{air}} \left( \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_5} \right) \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)
\]

Rearranging:  
\[
\ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_5} \right) = R \ln \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right) / c_p^{\text{air}}
\]

Substituting the pressure ratio:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{R}{c_p^{\text{air}}}}
\]

Using the isentropic relation:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]

Substituting known values:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}}
\]

After calculation:  
\[
T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]

For velocity \( w_6 \), the energy balance is:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right) - \dot{W}
\]

Simplifying:  
\[
0 = h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2}
\]

Rearranging for \( w_6 \):  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 \left( h_5 - h_6 - \dot{W} + \frac{w_5^2}{2} \right)}
\]  

Some terms are crossed out, but the equation for \( w_6 \) remains valid.
