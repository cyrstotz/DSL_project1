TASK 3b  
The final temperature is the same as \( T_{\text{EW}} \), because the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium.

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is \( 1.4 \, \text{bar} \), as the mass pressing on the ice remains constant.

TASK 3c  
Energy balance from state 1 to state 2:  
\[
m_2 \cdot u_2 - m_1 \cdot u_1 + Q_{12} - W_v = 0
\]  
Since \( m_1 = m_2 = m_g \), this simplifies to:  
\[
m_g \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12} - W_v
\]  

This equation shows that work is performed (\( W_v \)).

Substituting for \( Q_{12} \):  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) + W_v
\]  
\[
Q_{12} = 1082.43 \, \text{J} + W_v \quad \text{with} \quad V_{2,g} = 1.108 \, \text{L}
\]  

Work \( W_v \) is calculated as:  
\[
W_v = \int_{V_1}^{V_2} p \, dv = m_g \cdot p \cdot (V_{2,g} - V_{1,g})
\]  
\[
W_v = -0.872 \, \text{J}
\]  

Thus, the heat transferred is:  
\[
Q_{12} = 1081.5 \, \text{J}
\]
