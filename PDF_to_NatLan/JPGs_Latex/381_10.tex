TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn showing the freeze-drying process on a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled regions for "Fast," "Gas," "Triple," and "Flurry." Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked along the curve, representing different states in the process.  

TASK 4b  
The table outlines the states of the refrigerant during the freeze-drying process:  
- **State 1**: \( p_1 = p_2 \), described as "flowing."  
- **State 2**: "Damp," with \( s_2 = s_3 \) and labeled as "reversible adiabatic."  
- **State 3**: Pressure is 8 bar.  
- **State 4**: \( x_4 = 0 \), described as "flowing."  

An equation for the heat transfer is provided:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_R (h_2 - h_3)
\]  
Additional terms include:  
\[
\dot{W}_R = 81.258 \, \text{kW}
\]  

TASK 4c  
The enthalpy at state 2 is defined as \( h_2(x_2 = 1, s_3) \).  
The enthalpy at state 3 is given as:  
\[
h_3 = 264.15 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The enthalpy at state 4 is calculated using:  
\[
h_4 = h_1 = (u_4 \, \text{at 8 bar}) = 83.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is determined using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f(p_1)}{u_g - u_f}
\]
