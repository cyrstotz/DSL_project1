TASK 4c  
The pressure \( p_u \) is equal to \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  
The heat transfer rate is expressed as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_4 - h_1)
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
The heat transfer rate is given as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}} = \dot{Q}_{\text{K}} - \dot{Q}_{\text{R134a}}
\]  

TASK 4e  
The temperature \( T_i \) would remain constant, but only the pressure would change.
