TASK 2a  
The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. It includes labeled states and process paths:  
- State 2 to 3 is marked as "isentrop" (isentropic compression).  
- State 3 to 5 is labeled "isobar" (isobaric heat addition).  
- State 5 to 6 is labeled "isentrop" (isentropic expansion).  
- The axes are labeled: \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis, with units \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  

TASK 2b  
The energy balance for determining the outlet velocity \( w_6 \) and temperature \( T_6 \) is expressed as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_5 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} \right) - \dot{m} \left( h_6 + \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right) - \dot{W}_{56}
\]  
Where:  
\[
h_5 = c_p^{\text{air}} T_5, \quad h_6 = c_p^{\text{air}} T_6
\]  
The specific volume at state 6 is given as:  
\[
v_{+56} = v_{T56}^{\text{new}} - \int_n^7 v \, dp + \Delta ke
\]  
Some terms are crossed out in the equation, but the general energy balance approach is visible.
