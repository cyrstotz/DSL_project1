TASK 2a  
The process is drawn qualitatively in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars and adiabatic curves. The states are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with arrows indicating the direction of the process. The curve between states 1 and 2 is labeled "isentropic," while the curve between states 5 and 6 is labeled "adiabatic." The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature) in Kelvin on the vertical axis.  
- \( s \) (specific entropy) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \) on the horizontal axis.  

TASK 2b  
The energy balance is set up for the dynamic process:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m} \left[ h_i + ke + pe \right] + \sum Q_j - \sum W_n
\]  
Since the process is adiabatic, \( Q_j = 0 \), and no shaft work is performed, \( W_n = 0 \).  

The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the relation:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_c}{p_s} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_6 = \left( \frac{p_c}{p_s} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} T_5
\]  
Given \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \), \( p_c = 0.7586 \), and \( p_s = 0.5 \),  
\[
T_6 = 0.7586 \cdot 431.9 \, \text{K} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is determined using the energy equation:  
\[
O = \dot{m} \left[ h_s - h_c + \frac{w_s^2}{2} - \frac{w_c^2}{2} \right] - 0
\]  
\[
h_s - h_c = c_p \left( T_5 - T_6 \right) = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \cdot (431.9 \, \text{K} - 328.07 \, \text{K}) = 104.44825 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Using the velocity relation:  
\[
\frac{w_c^2}{2} = h_s - h_c + \frac{w_s^2}{2}
\]  
\[
w_c^2 = 2 \left( h_s - h_c + \frac{w_s^2}{2} \right)
\]  
\[
w_c = \sqrt{2 \left( h_s - h_c + \frac{w_s^2}{2} \right)} = \sqrt{2 \cdot (104.448 + 4.498)} = 220.47 \, \text{m/s}
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is \( 220.47 \, \text{m/s} \).
