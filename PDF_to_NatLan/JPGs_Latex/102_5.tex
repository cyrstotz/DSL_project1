TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn showing pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The curve represents the phase diagram of a substance, with a labeled "Triple Point" where the three phases coexist. The graph qualitatively illustrates the freeze-drying process steps i and ii.

TASK 4b  
The energy balance equation for the refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is written as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
where \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are enthalpies at states 2 and 3, respectively, and \( \dot{W}_K \) is the compressor work.

A table is provided with the following columns:  
- \( p \): Pressure  
- \( T \): Temperature  
- \( h \): Enthalpy  
- \( s \): Entropy  
- \( x \): Vapor quality  

The table contains data for states 1, 2, 3, and 4:  
- State 1: \( p = \text{not provided}, T = \text{not provided}, h = \text{not provided}, s = \text{not provided}, x = \text{not provided} \)  
- State 2: \( p = 5 \, \text{bar}, T = 31.33^\circ\text{C}, h = \text{not provided}, s = \text{not provided}, x = \text{not provided} \)  
- State 3: \( p = 8 \, \text{bar}, T = 31.33^\circ\text{C}, h = \text{not provided}, s = \text{not provided}, x = \text{not provided} \)  
- State 4: \( p = 8 \, \text{bar}, T = 37.83^\circ\text{C}, h = \text{not provided}, s = \text{not provided}, x = \text{not provided} \)  

Additional notes:  
- At state 4, the refrigerant is fully condensed.  
- Vapor quality \( x \) is mentioned as \( x = 0 \) for state 4.

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{|\dot{Q}_{\text{zul}}|}{|\dot{Q}_{\text{abl}} - \dot{Q}_{\text{zul}}|}
\]  
where \( \dot{Q}_{\text{zul}} \) is the heat input and \( \dot{Q}_{\text{abl}} \) is the heat rejected.
