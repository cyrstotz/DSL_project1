TASK 3d  
The internal energy at state 2 is given as:  
\[
U_2 = -118.145 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
The pressure at state 2 is equal to the pressure at state 1:  
\[
p_2 = p_1 = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The ice mass fraction at state 2 is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{U_2 - U_{\text{fest}}}{U_{\text{fl√ºssig}} - U_{\text{fest}}}
\]  

Substituting the values:  
\[
x_2 = 0.645 = x_{\text{Eis},2}
\]
