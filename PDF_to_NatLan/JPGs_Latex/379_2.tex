TASK 4a  
The page contains a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram illustrating the freeze-drying process.  
- The diagram shows phase regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "vapor."  
- The triple point is marked, and the sublimation region is highlighted.  
- The pressure axis ranges from 1 mbar to 6 mbar, while the temperature axis ranges from \(-102^\circ\text{C}\) to \(0^\circ\text{C}\).  
- The process steps "i" and "ii" are indicated on the diagram, with arrows showing transitions between states.  

TASK 4b  
The equation for the steady-state process in the compressor is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_t
\]  
For the reversible process:  
\[
s_2 = s_3
\]  
The temperature at state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_2 = T_i + 6 \, \text{K} = 297.15 \, \text{K} = 26^\circ\text{C}
\]  
The pressure at state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
p_2 = 1.0199 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The entropy at state 3 is expressed as:  
\[
s_3 = s_f(8 \, \text{bar}) + x(s_g - s_f)
\]  
Using values from Table A-11:  
\[
x = \frac{s_3 - s_f(8 \, \text{bar})}{s_g(8 \, \text{bar}) - s_f(8 \, \text{bar})}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x = \frac{0.983 - 0.3485}{0.9066 - 0.3485} = 0.337
\]  

TASK 4c  
The pressure at state 1 is given as:  
\[
p_1 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The vapor quality at state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
x_1 = 0
\]  
The enthalpy at state 1 is equal to the enthalpy at state 4:  
\[
h_1 = h_4
\]  
The enthalpy difference is expressed as:  
\[
D = \dot{m}(h_4 - h_3)
\]  
Using values from Table A-10:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_4 - h_f(-22^\circ\text{C})}{h_g(-22^\circ\text{C}) - h_f(-22^\circ\text{C})}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{93.42 - 29.77}{234.08 - 29.77} = 0.337
\]
