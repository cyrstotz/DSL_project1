TASK 2c  
The expression for the mass-specific increase in flow exergy is given as:  
\[
\dot{m} \, ex_{\text{flow}} = \dot{m} \left[ h - h_0 - T_0 \left( s - s_0 \right) + ke \right]
\]  

The equation for interpolation is:  
\[
y = y_1 + \frac{\left( y_2 - y_1 \right)}{\left( x_2 - x_1 \right)} \left( x - x_1 \right)
\]  

The mass flow ratio between bypass and core streams is calculated as:  
\[
\frac{m_M}{m_K} = 5.263
\]

TASK 2d  
The mass-specific exergy destruction is expressed as:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = T_0 \, S_{\text{gen}} \, \dot{m}_{\text{gen}}
\]
