TASK 2a  
The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
w_6^2 = w_x^2 + \frac{2(h_4 - h_6)}{h_4 - h_6}
\]

The enthalpy balance is expressed as:  
\[
(h_5 - h_6)w_x + h_4 = h_6
\]

The exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is determined using:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = ex_5 - ex_6 = (c_p T_5 \ln \frac{T_5}{T_6} + c_p T_6 - T_5)
\]

The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is given by:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_{\text{flow},6} - ex_{\text{flow},0}
\]

TASK 2b  
The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) in the engine is calculated as:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = \frac{w_6 - w_5}{w_6 - w_5}
\]

TASK 2c  
The integral for calculating the exergy destruction is expressed as:  
\[
\int_{T_1}^{T_2} c_p \ln \frac{T_1}{T_2} = (c_p T_1 \ln \frac{T_1}{T_2} + c_p T_2 - T_1)
\]

TASK 2d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated using:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]

Additional calculations for \( ex_{\text{flow}} \) and \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) are shown using integrals and logarithmic relationships between temperatures.
