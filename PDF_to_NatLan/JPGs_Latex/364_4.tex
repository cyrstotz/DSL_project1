TASK 4a  
The process is described as follows:  
- \( 1 \to 2 \): Isobaric process  
- \( 2 \to 3 \): Isentropic process  
- \( 3 \to 4 \): Isobaric process  
- \( 4 \to 1 \): Isentropic process with enthalpy remaining constant  

Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. A qualitative \( p \)-\( T \) diagram showing the cycle with labeled regions corresponding to the processes described above.  
2. A detailed \( p \)-\( h \) diagram with labeled points (1, 2, 3, 4) and process paths:  
   - \( 1 \to 2 \): Isobaric evaporation  
   - \( 2 \to 3 \): Isentropic compression  
   - \( 3 \to 4 \): Isobaric condensation  
   - \( 4 \to 1 \): Isentropic expansion  
   The diagram includes annotations such as "ND" (possibly nozzle dynamics), "isotherm," "isobar," and "grade (flüssig)" indicating liquid and gas phases.  

TASK 4b  
The given data includes:  
- Compressor work rate: \( \dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{kW} \)  
- Isentropic process assumption: \( S_2 = S_3 \)  

The energy balance equation is written:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{W}_K
\]  

The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

Values for enthalpy are provided:  
- \( h_3 = h(85 \, \text{kPa}) = 264.15 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  
- \( h_2 = h(277.15 \, \text{K}, x=1) = 243.53 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  

Substituting into the equation:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{28 \, \text{kW}}{243.53 - 264.15} = 1.915 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}}
\]  

Additional calculations are shown for \( \frac{3}{5} h_5 - h_4 \), but the context is unclear.  

Other notes include:  
- \( T_i = 0^\circ \text{C} + 40^\circ \text{C} \)  
- \( T_1 = 283.15 \, \text{K} + 40^\circ \text{C} \)  
- \( \Delta T = T_1 - T_6 = 277.15 \, \text{K} = 40^\circ \text{C} \)  

No further explanation is provided for these temperature values.
