TASK 2c  
The change in flow exergy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = ex_{\text{str},6} - ex_{\text{str},0}
\]

The flow exergy at state 6 is given by:  
\[
ex_{\text{str},6} = h_6 - h_0 - T_0(s_6 - s_0) + \text{ke} + \text{pe}
\]

Since potential energy (\( \text{pe} \)) is set to zero, the equation simplifies to:  
\[
ex_{\text{str},6} = h_6 - h_5 - T_0[s_6 - s_5] + \frac{1}{2} m_{\text{gas}} \cdot w_5^2
\]
