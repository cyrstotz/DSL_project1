TASK 3c  
The internal energy of the gas is calculated as follows:

\[
\Delta U = m \cdot u_2 - m \cdot u_1
\]

\[
= m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]

\[
= 0.00293 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot \left[ (0.003 \cdot 273.15) - (500 + 273.15) \, \text{K} \right]
\]

\[
= -0.927 \, \text{J}
\]

The work done by the gas is expressed as:

\[
W_{u,12} = m \int p \, dv
\]

The polytropic index \( n \) is determined as:

\[
n = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = \frac{R + c_v}{c_v}
\]

\[
n = 1.263
\]

The work done is then calculated as:

\[
W_{u,12} = m \cdot \frac{R \cdot (T_2 - T_1)}{1 - n}
\]

\[
= 0.926 \, \text{J}
\]
