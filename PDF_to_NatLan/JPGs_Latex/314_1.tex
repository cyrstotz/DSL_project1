TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled states \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The process transitions are marked, including compression, combustion, and expansion. Isobars are indicated, and the curve trends upward during compression and combustion, then downward during expansion.

TASK 2b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_G \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
T_G = T_5 \left( \frac{p_c}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} = 328.05 \, \text{K}
\]

Additional calculations are shown for the outlet velocity \( w_6 \):  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{w_5^2 + \frac{2 \, \dot{m}_K}{\dot{m}_M}}
\]

The specific gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{c_p - c_v}{\kappa} = 0.257 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]

The specific volume \( v_c \) is determined:  
\[
v_c = \frac{R T_c}{p_c} = 4.34 \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg}
\]

The specific heat capacity ratio \( c_{p,\text{air}} \) is given as:  
\[
c_{p,\text{air}} = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = \dot{m}_K \left( h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} \right)
\]

Intermediate values for \( h_6 \), \( h_0 \), \( s_6 \), and \( s_0 \) are substituted into the equation.

TASK 2d  
The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_5} \right) \dot{m}_K \cdot q_B
\]

Values for \( T_0 = 283.15 \, \text{K} \), \( T_5 = 1289 \, \text{K} \), and \( q_B = 1195 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) are used.

The mass flow rate ratio \( \frac{\dot{m}_M}{\dot{m}_K} \) is given as:  
\[
\frac{\dot{m}_M}{\dot{m}_K} = 5.293
\]

The mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_K \) is calculated:  
\[
\dot{m}_K = \frac{\dot{m}_M}{5.293} = 6.233 \, \text{kg/s}
\]
