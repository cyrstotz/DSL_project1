TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x = \frac{h_a - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
x = \frac{93.92 - 16.82}{231.62 - 16.82} = 0.356
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{zu}} \) is determined as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1)
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}} = 0.658 \cdot (231.62 - 93.92) = 90.9 \, \text{W}
\]  
Thus, the coefficient of performance is:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{90.9}{28} = 3.2977
\]

TASK 4e  
Eventually, the food and the freeze dryer will reach equilibrium, and at that point, no more heat can be extracted.
