TASK 4a  
A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn. The diagram includes the following features:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as \( p \) [Pa], and the horizontal axis is labeled as \( T \) [K].  
- A horizontal line is drawn at the triple point, labeled "Tripelpunkt." Below this line, the phase regions are labeled "solid" and "subsolid." Above the line, the phase regions are labeled "liquid" and "gas."  
- A process path is shown with numbered states (1, 2, 3).  
  - The path from state 1 to state 2 is labeled "isobar."  
  - The path from state 2 to state 3 is labeled "isotherm."

TASK 4c  
The following equations and notes are written:  
- The energy balance is expressed as:  
  \[
  \frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
  \]  
- The enthalpy at state 1 is written as:  
  \[
  h_1 = h_f + A - 11 \, (\text{Joule})
  \]  
  where \( h_f = 53.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  
- The enthalpy at state 2 is written as:  
  \[
  h_2(T, p) \quad \text{(to be determined based on temperature and pressure)}  
  \]  
- The vapor quality \( x \) is calculated using:  
  \[
  x = \frac{h - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
  \]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance (\( \epsilon_K \)) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{(\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} - Q_K)}
\]  

TASK 4e  
A statement is provided:  
"The power would increase because more heat would be removed."
