TASK 2a  
The page contains a table and additional notes related to the jet engine problem. The table is structured with columns labeled \( T \), \( P \), and \( h \), representing temperature, pressure, and enthalpy, respectively. The rows correspond to different states (1 through 6).  

### Table Content:
- **State 1**:  
  \( T = -30^\circ\text{C} \)  
  \( P_2 = P_4 \)  

- **State 2**:  
  \( P_3 = P_4 \)  

- **State 3**:  
  \( P_4 = P_5 \)  

- **State 5**:  
  \( T = 431.9 \, \text{K} \)  
  \( P = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  

- **State 6**:  
  \( P = 0.151 \, \text{bar} \)  

### Notes:
- \( \eta_{\text{comp}} < 1 \)  
- \( w_{\text{air}} = 200 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \)  
- \( w_5 = 220 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \)  
- \( c_p = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)  
- \( \frac{\dot{m}_M}{\dot{m}_K} = 5.293 \)  

### Description:
The table outlines the thermodynamic states of the jet engine process, including temperature and pressure values for specific states. The notes provide additional parameters such as the airspeed at the inlet (\( w_{\text{air}} \)), the velocity at state 5 (\( w_5 \)), and the specific heat capacity (\( c_p \)). The ratio of bypass to core mass flow rates (\( \frac{\dot{m}_M}{\dot{m}_K} \)) is also specified.
