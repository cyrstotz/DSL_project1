TASK 4a  
Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a rectangular cycle labeled "1, 2, 3, 4" on a \( p \)-\( T \) graph. The x-axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), and the y-axis is labeled \( p \, [\text{bar}] \). The cycle appears to represent a refrigeration process with isobaric and adiabatic transitions.  
2. The second diagram is a phase diagram with curved lines representing phase boundaries. The x-axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), and the y-axis is labeled \( p \, [\text{bar}] \). Points "1, 2, 3, 4" are marked, showing transitions between phases.  

TASK 4b  
The following calculations and notes are provided:  
- \( x_2 = 1 \), \( x_4 = 0 \)  
- From Table A11:  
  \[
  s_4 = s_f = 0.3495 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}, \quad h_4 = 83.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
  \]  
- \( T_i = 10^\circ \text{C} \)  
- Superheater temperature: \( T = 4^\circ \text{C} \)  
- \( s_2 = s_g = 0.9163 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}, \quad h_2 = 249.58 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  

The energy balance equation is written:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) - \dot{W}_i
\]  

Further calculations:  
- \( h_3 = 7 \)  
- \( s_3 = s_2 - s_{sf} \)  
- \( h_3 = h_{\text{sat}} + s_{30} - s_{sf} \)  
- Final result: \( h_3 = 264.15 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  

A table is drawn with columns labeled "4", "2", "3", "8", and rows labeled "x = 0".  

No further explanation is provided for the table.
