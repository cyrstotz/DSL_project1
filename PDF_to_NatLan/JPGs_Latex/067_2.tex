TASK 2a  
A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled points corresponding to states \( 1 \) through \( 6 \), with arrows showing the transitions between states. The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \), and the horizontal axis is labeled \( s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}] \). Several isobaric lines are drawn, and the points \( 5 \) and \( 6 \) are marked with asterisks to indicate isobaric processes. The pressures \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) are noted.

TASK 2b  
The energy balance for the flow process between states \( 5 \) and \( 6 \) is written as:  
\[
0 = m_{\text{ges}} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right]
\]  
The velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated using:  
\[
\frac{w_6^2}{2} = c_p \left( T_5 - T_6 \right) + \frac{w_5^2}{2}
\]  
The temperature \( T_6 \) is determined as:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  
The velocity \( w_6 \) is then calculated as:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{ \left( c_p \left( T_5 - T_6 \right) + \frac{w_5^2}{2} \right) \cdot 2 } = 507.25 \, \text{m/s}
\]

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = ex_{\text{str},a} - ex_{\text{str},e}
\]  
Breaking it down:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = h_a - h_e - T_0 \left( s_a - s_e \right) + \Delta ke
\]  
The kinetic energy change is:  
\[
\Delta ke = \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_5^2}{2} = 108.651 \, \text{J} = 108.651 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
The enthalpy difference is:  
\[
h_a - h_e = c_p \left( T_6 - T_0 \right) = 85.430 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
The entropy difference is:  
\[
s_a - s_e = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) = 0.301 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
The heat term is:  
\[
q = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - c_p \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) = 0.2874 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
Finally, the total increase in flow exergy is:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = 120.89 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
