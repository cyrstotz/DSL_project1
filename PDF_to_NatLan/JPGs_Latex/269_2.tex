TASK 3a  
The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M} = 166.28 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{mol·K}}
\]  
The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is determined as:  
\[
A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  
The pressure exerted by the ice-water mixture (\( p_{\text{EW}} \)) is given by:  
\[
p_{\text{EW}} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_g \cdot g}{A} = 1.3937 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The gas pressure (\( p_g \)) is calculated as:  
\[
p_g = p_{\text{EW}} + \frac{m_{\text{EW}} \cdot g}{A} \approx 1.4009 \, \text{bar}
\]  
Using the ideal gas law \( PV = mRT \), the gas mass is determined:  
\[
m = 3.42 \, \text{g}
\]  

TASK 3b  
The temperature of the ice-water mixture (\( T_{\text{EW}} \)) is:  
\[
T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  
The system remains in equilibrium at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), as the ice-water mixture is still in a two-phase state. The pressure in state 2 (\( p_{g,2} \)) is:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  
This is because at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), the equilibrium pressure of the ice-water mixture matches the calculated pressure.  

TASK 3c  
The energy balance for the system is expressed as:  
\[
U_{12} = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
The heat transferred (\( Q_{12} \)) and work done (\( W_{12} \)) are related by:  
\[
Q_{12} = U_{12} + W_{12} = -4367.157 \, \text{J}
\]  
The internal energy change (\( U_{12} \)) is calculated using the specific heat capacity \( c_V \):  
\[
U_{12} = c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) \cdot m = -1082.868 \, \text{J}
\]  
Where \( c_V = 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \).  
The work done (\( W_{12} \)) is given by:  
\[
W_{12} = p \cdot (V_2 - V_1) \approx -284.189 \, \text{J}
\]  

TASK 3d  
The energy balance for the ice-water mixture is expressed as:  
\[
U_{12} = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
The internal energy of the ice-water mixture (\( U_{\text{EW}} \)) is calculated as:  
\[
U_{\text{EW}} = U_{f1} + 0.6 \cdot (U_{f2} - U_{f1}) = -200.092 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
The heat transferred (\( Q_{12} \)) is:  
\[
Q_{12} = -188.921 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
The final ice fraction (\( x \)) is determined using the equilibrium conditions:  
\[
x = \frac{U_2 - U_{f1} (1.4 \, \text{bar})}{U_{f2} (1.4 \, \text{bar}) - U_{f1} (1.4 \, \text{bar})} \approx 0.559
\]
