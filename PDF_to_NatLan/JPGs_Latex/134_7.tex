TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is determined using the equation for an adiabatic throttle, which is an isentropic process:  
\[
s_1 = s_u \implies x_1 = \frac{s_u - s_{f4}}{s_{g4} - s_{f4}}
\]  
At \( s_u \) (8 bar, \( x_u = 0 \)):  
\[
s_u = s_f \quad \text{and} \quad s_f (8 \, \text{bar}) = 0.3459 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  
The temperature \( T \) is calculated as \( T = 31.33^\circ\text{C} \).

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{Q_K}{Q_{\text{ab}} - Q_Z} = \frac{Q_K}{W_K} = \frac{Q_K}{Q_{\text{ab}} - Q_Z} = \frac{Q_K}{28 \, \text{W}}
\]  
The heat transfer \( Q_K \) is given by:  
\[
Q_K = \dot{m} \cdot (-h_1 + h_2)
\]  
Further calculations or explanations are incomplete.
