TASK 2a

The page contains calculations and derivations related to the jet engine process described in Task 2. The focus appears to be on determining work and temperature changes during the process from state 5 to state 6, considering isentropic and polytropic processes.

---

The process from state 5 to state 6 is described as isentropic, with \( S_5 = S_6 \).

The reversible work \( w_{\text{rev}} \) is expressed as:
\[
w_{\text{rev}} = -\int_1^2 v \, dp + \Delta \text{ke}
\]
where \( \Delta \text{ke} \) represents the change in kinetic energy:
\[
\Delta \text{ke} = \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_5^2}{2}
\]

For a polytropic process (\( n \neq 1 \)), the work is derived as:
\[
w_{\text{rev}} = \int_1^2 v \, dp = \frac{R (T_6 - T_5)}{1 - n}
\]

The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the polytropic relation:
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]
Substituting values:
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.1 \, \text{bar}}{0.5 \, \text{bar}} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}}
\]
\[
T_6 = 328.1 \, \text{K}
\]

The work \( w_{\text{rev}} \) is then calculated:
\[
w_{\text{rev}} = 0.287 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \left( 328.1 \, \text{K} - 431.9 \, \text{K} \right) \frac{1}{1 - 1.4}
\]
\[
w_{\text{rev}} = 79.5 \, \text{kW}
\]

Additional expressions for work and energy balance are provided:
\[
w_{\text{rev}} = \dot{m} w_{\text{rev}}
\]
\[
\dot{m} \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right) - w_{\text{rev}} = 0
\]
\[
\dot{m} c (T_5 - T_6) + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} - w_{\text{rev}} = 0
\]
