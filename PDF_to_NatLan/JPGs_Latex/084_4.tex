TASK 3c  
The temperature of the gas in state 2 is given as \( T_{g,2} = 0.003^\circ\text{C} \), which corresponds to \( T_{g,2} = 273.153 \, \text{K} \).  

The pressure of the gas is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,2} = \frac{v_{g}}{v_{g}} = R_g \cdot T_{g,2}
\]  

The specific internal energy of the gas is given as:  
\[
u_{g,2} = \frac{V_{g} \cdot g}{m_g}
\]  

Substituting the temperature:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0.003^\circ\text{C} = 273.153 \, \text{K}
\]  

The heat transferred between states 1 and 2 is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q} = c_V \cdot m_g \cdot (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1})
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\dot{Q} = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \cdot 0.08242 \, \text{kg} \cdot (273.153 - 773)
\]  
\[
\dot{Q} = -1.08 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
Thus, \( Q = 1.08 \, \text{kJ} \).

TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is to be calculated.  

Using the energy balance:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = \dot{Q}_{12}
\]  
Given \( m_{\text{EW}} = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \).  

Thermodynamic relation:  
\[
u_2 \, \text{EN} = u_{g,2} \quad \text{so} \quad (u_2 - u_1)_{\text{EW}} = (u_{g,2} - u_{g,1})
\]  

The integral for the change in internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
\int_{T_1}^{T_2} c_V(T) \, dT = c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = \frac{\dot{Q}}{m_{\text{EW}}}
\]  

Substituting:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{\dot{Q}}{m_{\text{EW}}} + u_1
\]
