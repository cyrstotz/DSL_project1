TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{zu}}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
The heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{zu} \) is determined as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{zu} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1) = \frac{a}{3600} \, \text{kg/s} \cdot \left( 293.27 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - 93.92 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \right) = 167 \, \text{W}
\]  
Thus, the coefficient of performance is:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{167 \, \text{W}}{28 \, \text{W}} = 5.9693
\]  

TASK 4e  
The temperature would decrease until it reaches the sublimation temperature. It would then remain constant at that point until all the water has returned to the solid phase.  

TASK 4b  
The work rate \( \dot{W}_K \) is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{W}_K = \dot{m} \cdot (h_3 - h_2)
\]  
The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is determined as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_3 - h_2} = \frac{0.000839 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}}}{5} = 3.0035 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{h}}
\]
