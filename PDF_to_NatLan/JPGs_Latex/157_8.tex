TASK 4c  
The pressure at state 4 is given as \( p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  
The throttle process is isenthalpic, meaning \( h_1 = h_4 \).  
Additionally, \( h_4 = h_f \), where \( h_f \) represents the enthalpy of the saturated liquid.  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{|W_K|}
\]  
The heat flow \( \dot{Q}_K \) is left incomplete and no further values or equations are provided.
