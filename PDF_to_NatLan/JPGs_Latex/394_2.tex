TASK 2a  
The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) plot representing the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (\( [K] \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  

The process consists of six states:  
1. State 1 to State 2: A compression process.  
2. State 2 to State 3: Isobaric heat addition at \( p_3 = p_2 \).  
3. State 3 to State 4: Expansion process.  
4. State 4 to State 5: Isobaric heat rejection at \( p_4 = p_5 \).  
5. State 5 to State 6: Isobaric process at \( p_1 = p_6 \).  

Each state is marked with an "X" and connected by curves or lines indicating the respective thermodynamic transitions.

TASK 2b  
The energy balance equation for the entire turbine is written as:  
\[
Q_{\text{in}} = h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} + q_B
\]  
However, part of this equation is crossed out.

For the transition from State 5 to State 6 (adiabatic and reversible), the temperature \( T_6 \) is determined using the following relation:  
\[
\left( \frac{T_6}{T_5} \right) = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
where \( \kappa = 1.4 \).  

Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} = 328.1 \, \text{K}
\]  

Additional equations are partially visible but crossed out:  
- \( h_e - h_a = c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_a) \)  
- \( w_a = \sqrt{2 \left( h_e - h_a + q_B \right) + w_e^2} \)  
- \( q(T_e - T_a) \)  

These crossed-out sections are not transcribed further.
