TASK 3b  
The change in energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \sum Q - \sum W
\]  
The work term (\( \dot{W} \)) is zero because the system is incompressible (\( \omega = 0 \)).

TASK 3c  
The energy balance for the system is given as:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = c_V \left[ T_2 - T_1 \right] = Q_{12}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot \left( 0.003 \cdot 273 \, \text{K} \right) - \left( 273 + 500 \, \text{K} \right)
\]  
The heat transfer is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = -316 \, \dot{m}_g \, \omega
\]
