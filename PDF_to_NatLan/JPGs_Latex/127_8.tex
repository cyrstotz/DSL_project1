TASK 4b  
The refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_R \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\dot{m}_R = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h_u}
\]  
where \( T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C} \) and \( S_1 = S_f \).  

The enthalpy \( h_u \) is given as:  
\[
h_u = h_f
\]  
and specifically:  
\[
h_u = h_f(80 \, \text{cm}) = 93.2 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x \) is calculated as:  
\[
x = \frac{h_u - h_f(p_1, T_1)}{h_g(p_1, T_1) - h_f(p_1, T_1)}
\]  
which can also be expressed in terms of entropy:  
\[
x = S_u - S_f(p_1, T_1)
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is determined using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{Q}_u}{\dot{W}_u}
\]
