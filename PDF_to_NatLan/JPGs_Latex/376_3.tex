TASK 1b  
The relationship between heat \( Q \) and internal energy \( U \) is expressed using integrals.  

The integral of heat capacity \( c \) over temperature \( T \) is written as:  
\[
\int_{T_n}^{T_z} c \, dT
\]  
This is divided by the integral of \( c \) over \( \frac{1}{T} \):  
\[
c \int_{T_n}^{T_z} \frac{1}{T} \, dT
\]  

The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{MW}} \) is calculated as:  
\[
T_{\text{MW}} = \frac{T_z - T_n}{\ln\left(\frac{T_z}{T_n}\right)} = 293.12 \, \text{K}
\]
