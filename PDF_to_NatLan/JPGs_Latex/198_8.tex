TASK 3b  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined under the condition of no heat transfer.  
The relationship is given as:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]

---

TASK 3c  
The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is calculated using the energy balance for the gas.  
The equation is:  
\[
\Delta E = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]
