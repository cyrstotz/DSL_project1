TASK 1c  
The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is calculated using the heat transfer \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) and the thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) of the coolant.  

\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}} = -\frac{-62.28 \, \text{kW}}{295 \, \text{K}} = 0.2112 \, \text{kJ/sÂ·K}
\]

A diagram is included, showing the reactor system with heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) transferring to the cooling jacket. The system boundary is labeled, and arrows indicate the direction of heat transfer.

TASK 1d  
The problem involves cooling the reactor contents from state 1 (\( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \)) to state 2 (\( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \)). A mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) of saturated liquid water at \( T_{\text{in,12}} = 20^\circ\text{C} \) is added. The heat released during cooling is \( Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \, \text{MJ} \).  

A diagram is provided, showing the heat flow \( Q_{\text{out},12} \) and the transition between states 1 and 2.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta S = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_{\text{in}} + Q_{\text{out},12} - \sum W_{\text{ext}} = 0
\]

It is noted that \( m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12} \).

TASK 1e  
The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\Delta S = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1 = \Delta m_{12} s_{\text{in}} + \frac{Q_{\text{out}}}{T}
\]
