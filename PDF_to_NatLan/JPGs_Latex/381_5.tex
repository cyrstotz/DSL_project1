TASK 2d  
The page contains calculations and expressions related to exergy and energy balances in a turbine system.  

The exergy equation is written as:  
\[
O = \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}}
\]  
\[
O = \dot{Q}_{\text{estr}} + \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_j}\right) \dot{Q}_j - \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}} - \text{Ex}_{\text{verlust}}
\]  

Further simplifications are shown:  
\[
\text{Ex}_{\text{verlust}} = \dot{Q}_{\text{estr}} - \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}}
\]  
\[
= 100 \, \frac{\text{MJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

There is a note regarding the turbine:  
"Logically, the adiabatic turbine is considered."  

An energy balance for the turbine is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{\dot{W}_{\text{turbine}}}{\dot{m}} = \frac{(h_3 - h_4)}{c_V (T_3 - T_4)} + \dot{Q}_j
\]
