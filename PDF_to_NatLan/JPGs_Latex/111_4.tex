TASK 2d  
The energy balance around the turbine is described as stationary, with the following equation:  

\[
0 = -\Delta ex_{\text{str}} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_B} \right) \dot{Q}_B - \sum \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \cdot ex_{\text{in}} - \dot{E}_{\text{ex,vert}}
\]

It is noted that the turbine does not transfer heat across system boundaries.  

From this, the equation is simplified:  

\[
0 = -\Delta ex_{\text{str}} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_B} \right) q_B - ex_{\text{vert}}
\]

The specific exergy destruction (\( ex_{\text{vert}} \)) is calculated as:  

\[
ex_{\text{vert}} = -100 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + \left( 1 - \frac{243.15}{1289} \right) \cdot 1195
\]

This results in:  

\[
ex_{\text{vert}} = 869.582 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
