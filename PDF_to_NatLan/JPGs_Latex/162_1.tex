TASK 4a  
The equation for entropy at state 4 is given as:  
\[
S_4 = S_{1,a} + S_{f4}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x = \frac{S_4 - S_{f4}}{S_{g} - S_{f4}}
\]  

TASK 4e  
The cycle is stopped because the refrigerant is no longer compressed.  

Description of the diagram:  
A faint graph is visible, which appears to be a phase diagram with labeled axes. The graph includes curves representing phase transitions, but the details are unclear due to the faintness of the image.
