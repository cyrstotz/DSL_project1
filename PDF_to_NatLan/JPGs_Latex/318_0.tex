TASK 1a  
The energy balance equation for the reactor is written as:  
\[
\dot{m}(h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_R = 0
\]  
where \( h_e = 292.98 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \) and \( h_a = 419.09 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{Q}_R = 62.18 \, \text{kW}
\]

TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) of the coolant is determined using the entropy integral:  
\[
T = \frac{\int_a^e T \, ds}{S_a - S_e}
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
T = \frac{T_a - T_e}{\ln\left(\frac{T_a}{T_e}\right)} = 293.72 \, \text{K}
\]

TASK 1c  
The entropy production rate \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is calculated using the entropy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(S_e - S_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = -0.3 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}} \cdot (0.9549 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} - 1.3068 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}) + \frac{62.18 \, \text{kW}}{293.72 \, \text{K}}
\]  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 0.1 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]

TASK 1d  
The heat released during cooling is given as \( Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \, \text{MJ} \).  

The mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) of saturated liquid water added is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
m_2 h_2 = m_1 h_1 + \Delta m_{12} h_{12}
\]  
The energy of water in saturated state 1 is expressed as:  
\[
x \cdot m_{g0} h_g + (1-x) \cdot m_{g0} h_f
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
h_g = 2676.1 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}, \quad h_f = 419.0 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
2406.88 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} = H_{\text{gas}}
\]  

No further numerical solution is provided for \( \Delta m_{12} \).
