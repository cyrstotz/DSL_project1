The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated as follows:

The entropy change formula is:  
\[
\Delta S = m_2 S_2 - m_1 S_1
\]

Where:  
- \( m_2 = \Delta m_{12} + m_1 \)  
- \( m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg} \)  
- \( \Delta m_{12} = 3600 \, \text{kg} \)  
Thus, \( m_2 = 3600 \, \text{kg} + 5755 \, \text{kg} = 9355 \, \text{kg} \).

From the sheet:  
\[
m_2 = 9355 \, \text{kg}
\]

The entropy at state 2 is given as:  
\[
S_2 = 0.95442 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]

At \( 100^\circ\text{C} \), the entropy at state 1 is calculated using:  
\[
S_1 = S_f + x (S_g - S_f)
\]

Where:  
- \( S_f = 1.8069 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \)  
- \( x = 0.005 \)  
- \( S_g = 7.3549 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \)  

Substituting values:  
\[
S_1 = 1.8069 + 0.005 (7.3549 - 1.8069) = 1.33714 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]

Finally, the entropy change is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S = 9355 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.95442 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} - 5755 \, \text{kg} \cdot 1.33714 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]

Performing the calculation:  
\[
\Delta S = 1237.849 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]  

This is the total entropy change between state 1 and state 2.
