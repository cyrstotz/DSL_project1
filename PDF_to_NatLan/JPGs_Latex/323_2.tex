TASK 2a  
Two diagrams are drawn to represent the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine.  

1. **First diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and \( S \) (entropy).  
   - The process starts at point 1 and follows an isentropic path to point 2.  
   - From point 2, the process moves to point 3 along an isobaric path.  
   - The process then transitions to point 4 via an adiabatic path.  
   - From point 4, the process moves to point 5 along another isobaric path.  
   - Finally, the process transitions to point 6 along an isentropic path.  
   - The diagram includes annotations for "isentrop" (isentropic) and "isobar" (isobaric) processes.  

2. **Second diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and \( S \) (entropy).  
   - The process starts at point 1 and follows an isentropic path to point 2.  
   - From point 2, the process moves to point 3 along an isobaric path.  
   - The process transitions to point 4 via an adiabatic path.  
   - From point 4, the process moves to point 5 along another isobaric path.  
   - Finally, the process transitions to point 6 along an isentropic path.  
   - The diagram includes annotations for "isentrop" (isentropic) and "isobar" (isobaric) processes.

TASK 2b  
The first law of thermodynamics is applied to the jet engine.  

\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} \right) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]

Simplified to:  
\[
0 = h_o - h_s + \frac{w_{\text{out}}^2 - w_0^2}{2}
\]

The equation for work output:  
\[
w_c = z \left( h_o - h_s \right) + w_{\text{out}}^2
\]

The enthalpy difference is expressed as:  
\[
h_o - h_s = \int_{T_0}^{T_o} c_p(T) \, dT
\]

To determine \( T_6 \):  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.8 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.191 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{Pa}}{0.5 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{Pa}} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}}
\]

Result:  
\[
T_6 = 328.075 \, \text{K}
\]

The enthalpy difference \( h_6 - h_o \):  
\[
h_6 - h_o = c_p \left( T_6 - T_0 \right) = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \left( 328.075 \, \text{K} - 243 \, \text{K} \right)
\]

Result:  
\[
h_6 - h_o = 85.41355 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
