TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 = 0 \).  
The pressure \( p_{\text{comp}} = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  

The process is described as adiabatic.  

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_{k,2} - h_{k,1}) = \dot{W}_K + Q
\]  
Given values:  
\[
h_{k,2} = h_{k,1} = 53.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

TASK 4d  
The atmospheric pressure \( p_{\text{amb}} = 1 \, \text{bar} \).  
The temperature \( T_2 = -20 \, \text{K} \) is given.  

From the table, \( T_{\text{AB}} = 470 \, \text{K} \).  

The vapor quality \( x_4 \) is calculated using:  
\[
x_4 = \frac{h_4 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  

Values:  
\[
h_f = 3.33 + 3.50 = 6.83 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
h_g = \frac{h_2}{c_p} = 26.9 + 34.5 = 40.4 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Result:  
\[
x_4 = 0.2762
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  

Using the energy balance:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} \cdot (h_1 - h_2) = 0.11642861 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{s}}
\]  

Mass flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{4.42}{3600}
\]  

Result:  
\[
\epsilon_K = 5.187
\]
