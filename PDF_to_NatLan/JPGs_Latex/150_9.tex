The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_K
\]  

The heat removed by the refrigerant, \( \dot{Q}_K \), is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = -\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_1 - h_2) = 744.3 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{h}} = 120.3 \, \text{W}
\]  

The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is determined using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{|\dot{Q}_K|}{|W_A|} = 4.3
\]
