TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is given by:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \cdot h_{\text{comp}}}
\]  

TASK 4e  
The temperature would remain constant at the same temperature as the cooling medium in equilibrium:  
\[
T_i = T_i - 6
\]  
Cold cannot be transferred further because the \( \Delta H \) is insufficient to transfer heat.
