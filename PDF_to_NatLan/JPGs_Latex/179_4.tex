TASK 2a  
The diagram is a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) plot representing the jet engine thermodynamic process. It includes labeled states (1 through 6) and key process paths:  
- **Isobaric processes** are marked between states 2 and 3, and states 5 and 6.  
- **Isentropic processes** are marked between states 1 and 2, and states 4 and 5.  
- The combustion process is labeled between states 3 and 4.  
The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( S \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis.  

TASK 2b  
The calculation begins with the determination of \( T_6 \):  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

Given values:  
\[
T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}, \quad p_5 = 0.791 \, \text{bar}, \quad p_6 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}, \quad \kappa = 1.4
\]  

The mass flow rate is assumed constant:  
\[
\dot{m}_6 = \dot{m}_5
\]  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) + \dot{m} \cdot w
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
Q = -q_B \quad \text{(crossed out section)}  
\]  

Final equation for \( Q \):  
\[
Q = 1195 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \cdot \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) - c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_3)
\]  

(Note: Some parts of the equations are crossed out and unclear.)
