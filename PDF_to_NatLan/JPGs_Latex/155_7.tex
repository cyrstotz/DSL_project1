TASK 4b  
The energy balance at the compressor is described as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] - \dot{W}_K
\]  
Rearranging gives:  
\[
\dot{W} = \dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right]
\]  
The process is isentropic, so:  
\[
s_2 = s_3
\]  

TASK 4c  
The pressure at state 4 is:  
\[
p_u = p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]  
At state 4, the refrigerant is fully condensed:  
\[
h_4 = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
After throttling, the enthalpy remains constant:  
\[
h_4 = h_1 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
The temperature at state 1 is:  
\[
T_1 = T_i - 6 \, \text{K}
\]
