TASK 1a  
The reactor operates in steady-state conditions.  

The inlet mass flow rate is \( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \), and the inlet temperature is \( T_{\text{in}} = 70^\circ\text{C} \). The phase of the inlet stream is saturated liquid.  

The outlet mass flow rate is \( \dot{m}_{\text{out}} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \), and the outlet temperature is \( T_{\text{out}} = 100^\circ\text{C} \). The phase of the outlet stream is saturated liquid.  

Reactor properties:  
- Total mass in the reactor: \( m_{\text{total}} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \)  
- Steam quality: \( x_D = 0.005 \)  
- Reactor temperature: \( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \), which remains constant.  
- Heat released by the chemical reaction: \( \dot{Q}_R = 100 \, \text{kW} \)  
- Heat flow removed by the coolant: \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = ? \)  

Coolant properties:  
- Coolant inlet temperature: \( T_{\text{KF,in}} = 288.15 \, \text{K} \)  
- Coolant outlet temperature: \( T_{\text{KF,out}} = 298.15 \, \text{K} \)  

The heat transfer to the coolant is indicated as critical ("IF!") for removing the reaction heat.
