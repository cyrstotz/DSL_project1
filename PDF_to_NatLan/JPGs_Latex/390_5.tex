TASK 3c  
The first law of thermodynamics is applied to a gaseous system.  

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  

This can be rewritten as:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is given by:  
\[
Q_{12} = U_2 - U_1 + W_{12}
\]
