TASK 1a  
The first law of thermodynamics is applied:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}}) + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} + \dot{Q}_R
\]  

From Table A-2:  
- \( h_{\text{in}}(70^\circ\text{C}, \text{saturated liquid}) = 292.984 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
- \( h_{\text{out}}(100^\circ\text{C}, \text{saturated liquid}) = 419.044 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}(h_{\text{out}} - h_{\text{in}}) + \dot{Q}_R
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 62.182 \, \text{kW}
\]

TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is determined using the integral:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_{T_e}^{T_a} T \, dS}{S_a - S_e} = \frac{1}{S_a - S_e} \left( \frac{T_a^2}{2} - \frac{T_e^2}{2} \right)
\]  

The entropy difference is expressed as:  
\[
S_a - S_e = c_p \ln\left(\frac{T_a}{T_e}\right)
\]

TASK 1c  
The entropy production rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \dot{m}(S_a - S_e) - \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}}
\]

TASK 1d  
The heat released during cooling is given as:  
\[
Q_{R,12} = Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \, \text{MJ}
\]  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{gas},1}(
\]
