TASK 1c  
The diagram shows a reactor system with heat flows \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) and \( \dot{Q}_{\text{in}} \), and temperatures labeled as \( T_{\text{Reactor}} = 100^\circ\text{C} \) and \( T_{\text{KF}} \) for the coolant. The system is described as a closed system boundary.  

An entropy balance is performed:  
\[
\frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{Reactor}}} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 0
\]  
Rearranging for entropy generation:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \left( \frac{1}{T_{\text{KF}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{Reactor}}} \right)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 4.5946 \cdot 10^{-1} \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{K}^{-1} = 95.496 \, \frac{\text{W}}{\text{K}}
\]  

TASK 1d  
The reactor temperature is reduced to \( T_2 = 70^\circ\text{C} \).  

An energy balance is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta m_{12} \cdot h_{\text{ein}} + Q_{\text{out}} + Q_R - W^{70}
\]  
The equation simplifies to:  
\[
m_0 u_2 + \Delta m_{12} u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_e
\]  
Rearranging terms:  
\[
m_{12} u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} (h_e - u_2)
\]  
Finally:  
\[
m_1 \frac{(u_2 - u_1)}{h_e - u_2} = \Delta m_{12}
\]
