TASK 3d (continued)

The equation for the heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is expressed as:
\[
Q_{12} = \Delta m_{\text{EW,ice}} \cdot (\Delta u)
\]

The change in mass of ice, \( \Delta m_{\text{EW,ice}} \), is calculated as:
\[
\Delta m_{\text{EW,ice}} = \frac{Q_{12}}{\Delta u}
\]

Substituting values:
\[
\Delta m_{\text{EW,ice}} = \frac{5.88 \, \text{kJ}}{\Delta u}
\]

The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is determined using:
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1 - \Delta m_{\text{EW,ice}}}{0.1}
\]

Substituting values:
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.5415
\]

This represents the final ice fraction in state 2.
