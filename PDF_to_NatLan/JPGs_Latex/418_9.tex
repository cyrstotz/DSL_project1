TASK 4c  
The equation for \( \phi \) is given as:  
\[
\phi = \phi_f + x_1 (\phi_g - \phi_f)
\]  
Rearranging to solve for \( x_1 \):  
\[
x_1 = \frac{\phi - \phi_f}{\phi_g - \phi_f}
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{abs}}}{\dot{W}_K}
\]
