TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) in Kelvin, and the horizontal axis is labeled \( s \) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \). The diagram includes labeled points corresponding to states \( 0 \), \( 5 \), \( 6 \), and \( B \). The process lines connect these states, with dashed lines indicating isobars. The region is marked "Isobaren" (isobars).

TASK 2b  
The following values and equations are provided:  
\[
w_5 = 220 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}, \quad p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}, \quad T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
w_6 = ?, \quad p_6 = p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}, \quad T_6 = ?
\]  
The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the isentropic relation:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
where \( n = \kappa = 1.4 \). Substituting the values:  
\[
T_6 = 293.9 \, \text{K}
\]  

An energy balance equation is written:  
\[
O = \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right)
\]  
The enthalpy difference \( h_5 - h_6 \) is expressed as:  
\[
h_5 - h_6 = c_{p,\text{air}} \cdot \left( T_5 - T_6 \right)
\]  
Substituting into the energy balance:  
\[
O = \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \left( c_{p,\text{air}} \cdot \left( T_5 - T_6 \right) + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right)
\]  
This equation simplifies to:  
\[
O = \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \cdot c_{p,\text{air}} \cdot \left( T_5 - T_6 \right) - \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2}
\]
