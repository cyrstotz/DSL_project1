TASK c)

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is calculated using the energy balance equation:
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12}
\]
The mass difference between states 2 and 1 contributes to \( Q_{12} \):
\[
m(h_2 - h_1) = Q_{12}
\]
Given:
\[
m = 3 \, \text{kg}
\]
The heat transfer is calculated as:
\[
m \cdot c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = Q_{12} = -7082.24 \, \text{J}
\]
Where:
\[
T_2 = 0.003^\circ\text{C}, \quad T_1 = 100^\circ\text{C}
\]

TASK d)

To determine \( \Delta m_{12} \), the following steps are used:

1. Apply the energy balance to the system:
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12}
\]
The mass difference is calculated using:
\[
m(h_2 - h_1) = Q_{12}
\]
Rearranging:
\[
m = \frac{Q_{12}}{h_2 - h_1} = -185.2704 \, \text{kg}
\]
Where:
\[
Q_{12} = 7082.24 \, \text{J}, \quad m = 0.01 \, \text{kg}
\]

The enthalpy difference is calculated using the specific enthalpy values:
\[
h_2 = \text{uplifting} + x \cdot (h_{\text{res}} - h_{\text{liq}})
\]
\[
h_{\text{liq}} = -0.01 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}, \quad h_{\text{res}} = -333.988 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
The resulting enthalpy difference is:
\[
h_2 = -200.0928 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
