The page contains the following mathematical expressions and text:

1. \( m_{g,2} = m_{g,1} - \Delta m_{12} = m_{g,1} \)  
   This equation seems to describe the mass balance of the gas between two states.

2. \( [V_{g,2} - V_{g,1}] \cdot p_{\text{amb}} = 0 \)  
   This equation relates the change in gas volume to the ambient pressure.

3. \( Q_{12} - W_{12} + [x_{2} - x_{1}] \cdot w = 0 \)  
   This equation appears to be an energy balance involving heat transfer \( Q_{12} \), work \( W_{12} \), and a term involving \( x \) and \( w \).

4. \( \frac{m_{R}}{m_{K}} = \frac{w_{T}}{w_{K}} = \frac{1}{\eta_{K}} \cdot \epsilon_{K} \)  
   This equation seems to describe a relationship between mass ratios, work ratios, efficiency \( \eta_{K} \), and performance coefficient \( \epsilon_{K} \).

Some text and equations are crossed out and therefore ignored.
