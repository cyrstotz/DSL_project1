TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the following equations:  
\[
p_1 = p_2
\]
\[
p_1 = 1.272152 \, \text{bar} = p_m
\]
\[
p_m = -22^\circ\text{C} / 1.272152 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The throttling process is isenthalpic:  
\[
s_g - s_f = 0.345 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
The vapor quality \( x \) is determined as:  
\[
x = \frac{s_1 - s_f}{s_g - s_f} = 0.303
\]  
Where:  
\[
s_f = 0.0807 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}, \quad s_g = 0.9357 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = 5.8373
\]  
Where:  
\[
\dot{W}_K = 284 \, \text{kW}
\]  
The heat transfer rate is given by:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1) = 762.37 \, \text{kJ/kg} = \dot{Q}_m
\]  
The mass flow rate is:  
\[
\dot{m} = 0.00170 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}}
\]  
(Note: Some crossed-out calculations are ignored.)  

The enthalpy values are:  
\[
h_1 = h_f + x(h_g - h_f) = 86.703 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
Where:  
\[
h_f = 22.77 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}, \quad h_g = 234.08 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
Thus:  
\[
h_2 = 234.08 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
