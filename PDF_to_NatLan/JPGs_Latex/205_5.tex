TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
pV = mRT \quad \Rightarrow \quad T = T_{\text{gas}}
\]  
Given \( T_{\text{EW},1} = 0^\circ\text{C} \), the temperature of the gas is also \( T_{\text{gas}} = 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The pressure is determined as:  
\[
p = 1.1 \, \text{bar} \quad \text{(from Table 1)}  
\]  

TASK 3b  
The equilibrium is maintained under incompressible conditions, and the forces remain constant.  

TASK 3c  
The transferred heat \( Q_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)  
\]  
where:  
\[
T_2 - T_1 = \ln \left( \frac{U_2 - U_1}{m} \right)  
\]  

TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is determined using the solid-liquid equilibrium table.  

Additional notes:  
- \( Q_{12} \) is proportional to \( \ln \left( \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_{\text{avg}}} \right) \).  
- The temperature \( T_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
T_2 = T_1 + Q_{12} / m \cdot c_V  
\]
