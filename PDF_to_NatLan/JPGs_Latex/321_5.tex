TASK 3c  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12}
\]  
The internal energy difference is expressed as:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12}
\]  
Substituting for mass and specific internal energy:  
\[
m_g (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1})
\]  
Substituting the given values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 3.4277 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.683 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot (0.003 \, \text{K} - 500 \, \text{K})
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1.08286 \, \text{kJ} = -1082.86 \, \text{J}
\]
