The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is calculated using the entropy balance for the system:  

\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 S_2 - m_1 S_1
\]

Expanding the equation:  

\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_1 (S_2 - S_1) + \Delta m_{12} S_2
\]

Additionally, the mass \( m_2 \) is expressed as:  

\[
m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12}
\]
