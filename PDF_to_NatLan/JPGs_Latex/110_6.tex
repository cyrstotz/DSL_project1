TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is calculated using the integral definition:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_{s_a}^{s_e} T \, ds}{s_a - s_e}
\]  

The entropy difference \( s_a - s_e \) is expressed as:  
\[
s_a - s_e = \int_{T_2}^{T_1} \frac{c_{p}(T)}{T} \, dT
\]  
where \( p \) is constant and \( n = \text{constant} \).  

From the calculation, the thermodynamic mean temperature is determined to be:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = 295 \, \text{K}
\]

TASK 1c  
The entropy production rate \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is given by:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = ?
\]  

The entropy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = 0 = \dot{m} \, (s_e - s_a) + \sum \frac{\dot{Q}_j}{T_j} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  

This equation accounts for the entropy flow due to mass transfer, heat transfer, and entropy generation.
