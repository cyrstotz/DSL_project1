TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn showing a qualitative process in a \( T \)-\( S \) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled \( T [K] \), representing temperature, and the horizontal axis is labeled \( S [\frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg·K}}] \), representing entropy. Several isobars are depicted, labeled as \( P_2 = P_3 \), \( P_1 = P_5 = P_4 \), and \( P_0 \). The states are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with arrows indicating the transitions between states.  

TASK 2b  
An energy balance equation is written for the jet engine.  

\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{GES}} \left( h_0 - h_6 + \frac{w_0^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right) + \dot{Q}_{16}^0 - \dot{W}_{16}^0
\]

Another energy balance equation is written for state 5 to state 6:  

\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{GES}} \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right) + \dot{Q}_{56}^0 - \dot{W}_{56}^0
\]

A sketch of a turbine is drawn, showing the transition from state 5 to state 6.  

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific exergy destruction is calculated using the formula:  

\[
\Delta ex_{\text{STR}} = h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2}
\]

The enthalpy difference \( h_6 - h_0 \) is expressed as:  

\[
h_6 - h_0 = c_{p,\text{LUFT}} (T_6 - T_0)
\]

Substituting values:  

\[
h_6 - h_0 = 1.006 (340 - 233.15) = 97.43 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The entropy difference \( s_6 - s_0 \) is expressed as:  

\[
s_6 - s_0 = c_{p,\text{LUFT}} \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - k \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right)
\]

Substituting values:  

\[
s_6 - s_0 = 1.006 \ln \left( \frac{340}{233.15} \right) = 0.3373 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]
