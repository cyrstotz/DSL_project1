TASK 3b  
The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \) because the weight above always remains constant.  
The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is calculated as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) because it is in equilibrium with the ice-water liquid-solid mixture.  

---

TASK 3c  
The temperature \( T_{g,12} \) is \( 0.003^\circ\text{C} \), which corresponds to \( 273.153 \, \text{K} \).  
The specific volume \( V_{g,12} \) is not explicitly calculated here.  

The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
Since no work is performed (\( W_{12} = 0 \)), the equation simplifies to:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} (U_2 - U_1) = Q_{12}
\]  

The internal energy \( U_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
U_2 = x_2 \, U_{g2} + (1 - x_2) \, U_{f2}
\]  
The internal energy \( U_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
U_1 = x_1 \, U_{g1} + (1 - x_1) \, U_{f1}
\]  

Additional notes mention that the equilibrium leads to minimal work being performed.
