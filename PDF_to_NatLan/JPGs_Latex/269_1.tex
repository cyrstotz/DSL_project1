The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is given as \( 510 \, \text{m/s} \), and the temperature \( T_0 \) is \( 390 \, \text{K} \).  

The enthalpy difference is expressed as:  
\[
h_6 - h_0 = T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{1}{2} w_6^2 - \frac{1}{2} w_0^2
\]  

The enthalpy change \( h_6 - h_0 \) is calculated using:  
\[
h_6 - h_0 = c_p (T_6 - T_0) = 372.22 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The entropy change \( s_6 - s_0 \) is given by:  
\[
s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right)
\]  

After calculation, the entropy change is:  
\[
s_6 - s_0 = 5.867 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]
