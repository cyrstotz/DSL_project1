TASK 1a  
The mean temperature difference \( \bar{T} \) is expressed as:  
\[
\bar{T} = \int_{s_e}^{s_a} T \, ds = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{\dot{m}}
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
\bar{T} = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{\ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)}
\]  
where \( T_2 \) and \( T_1 \) are the temperatures at the respective states. This assumes ideal fluid behavior.  

TASK 1c  
The entropy production is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \dot{m}(s_c - s_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_i}
\]  
where \( T_i = 100^\circ\text{C} = 373.15 \, \text{K} \).  

The entropy change due to heat transfer is given as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \dot{m}(s_c - s_e)
\]  
with values:  
\[
s_e = s_f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 0.8549
\]  
\[
s_a = s_f(100^\circ\text{C}) = 1.3069
\]  

The entropy production is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{373.15} = 0.1273
\]  

Additional notes:  
- \( s_f \) values are taken from water tables at the respective temperatures.  
- The diagram at the bottom of the page appears to represent a cycle, labeled "half-open cycle," but no further details are provided.
