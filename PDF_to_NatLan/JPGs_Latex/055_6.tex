TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn with axes labeled \( p \) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \( T \) (temperature) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts a phase diagram with regions for different phases. A line labeled "4" is shown, representing isobaric evaporation at a temperature 6 K below \( T_i \). The diagram includes arrows indicating transitions between states, but some details are unclear.

TASK 4b  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a + ke + gz(z_e - z_a) \right] + \Delta \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}_{\text{in}}
\]  
Simplified to:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left[ h_1 - h_p \right] + (-\dot{Q}_{\text{abs}}) + Q_K + 28W
\]  

Further simplifications:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_1 - h_2 \right] + Q_K
\]  
\[
Q_K = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left[ h_2 - h_1 \right]
\]  

For the transition between states 2 and 3:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] + Q_K + 28W
\]  
\[
= \dot{m} \left[ \int_{T_1}^{T_2} c_p(T) dT + v \Delta p (p_2 - p_1) \right] + Q_K + 28W
\]  

Additional notes mention \( h_2 \) as "ges√§ttigt dampf" (saturated vapor).

TASK 4c  
The entropy change is described as:  
\[
\Delta Q \rightarrow \phi = \phi_f + x (\phi_g - \phi_f)
\]  
\[
S = S_f + x (S_g - S_f)
\]  
Where \( S_1 = S_f \).  

It is noted that in state 4, the refrigerant is fully condensed. Reference is made to Table A7 for further data.

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\left| Q_{\text{in}} \right|}{\left| W_e \right|} = \frac{\left| Q_{\text{abs}} \right|}{\left| Q_{\text{abs}} - \left| W_e \right| \right|}
\]
