TASK 4e  
It would decrease until the condensation temperature of R134a is reached, which is approximately \( -22^\circ \text{C} \). Afterward, no more heat would be released because equilibrium is achieved.

TASK 4a  
The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph. It shows the phase regions for the freeze-drying process. The curve represents the phase boundary, with points labeled \( i \) and arrows indicating transitions. The x-axis is labeled \( T(\text{K}) \), and the y-axis is labeled \( p(\text{N/m}^2) \).
