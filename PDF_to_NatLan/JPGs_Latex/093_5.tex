TASK 2c  
The entropy production (\( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \)) is calculated using the exergy balance equation. The general form of the equation is:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) \right) + \dot{Q}_{\text{KF}} \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_{\text{KF}}} \right) - \dot{W}_{\text{in}} - \dot{E}_{\text{in}}.
\]  
Here, \( h \) represents enthalpy, \( s \) represents entropy, \( T_0 \) is the ambient temperature, \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is the thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant, \( \dot{Q}_{\text{KF}} \) is the heat flow, \( \dot{W}_{\text{in}} \) is the work input, and \( \dot{E}_{\text{in}} \) is the exergy input.  

The exergy destruction term (\( \dot{E}_{\text{dest}} \)) is defined as:  
\[
\dot{E}_{\text{dest}} = T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}.
\]  

TASK 2d  
The exergy balance equation is extended to include all relevant terms for steady-state operation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_c - h_a - T_0 (s_c - s_a) \right) + \dot{Q}_{\text{KF}} \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_{\text{KF}}} \right) + \dot{W}_{\text{in}} - \sum_{u} \dot{E}_{\text{in}} - \dot{E}_{\text{out}}.
\]  
Here, \( h_c \) and \( h_a \) represent enthalpy at different states, \( s_c \) and \( s_a \) represent entropy at different states, and \( \dot{E}_{\text{out}} \) is the exergy output.  

Additional terms such as kinetic energy changes (\( \frac{1}{2} (w_6^2 - w_0^2) \)) are included where applicable.
