TASK 3a  

The equation for \( U_2 \) is given as:  
\[
U_2 = (x_2 \cdot U_{\text{f,ice}}) + x_2 \cdot U_{\text{f,water}}
\]  

The value of \( U_{\text{f,ice}} \) is calculated as:  
\[
U_{\text{f,ice}} = -200.0328 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The equation for \( U_2 \) is expanded as:  
\[
U_2 = x_2 \cdot U_{\text{f,ice}} + Q_{12}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
U_2 = -185.0328 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The temperature \( T_2 \) is given as:  
\[
T_2 = 0.003^\circ \text{C}
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = 1.75 \, \text{MJ}
\]  

TASK 3b  

The entropy change is calculated using:  
\[
b \cdot U_{\text{f,ice}} / 0.00328 = -333.4428 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The mass is calculated as:  
\[
b \cdot U_{\text{f,ice}} / 0.00328 = 0.033 \, \text{kg}
\]  

TASK 3c  

The equation for \( U_2 \) is rewritten as:  
\[
U_2 = (x_2 \cdot U_{\text{f,ice}}) + x_2 \cdot U_{\text{f,water}}
\]  

The equation for \( x_2 \) is derived as:  
\[
x_2 = U_2 - U_{\text{f,water}}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
x_2 = U_{\text{f,ice}} - U_{\text{f,water}}
\]  

The final value of \( x_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_2 = 0.555
\]
