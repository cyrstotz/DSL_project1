TASK 4a  
The process is described as reversible and adiabatic, which implies that \( U_4 = U_1 \).  

For isobaric condensation, the pressure at state 4 equals the pressure at state 3:  
\[
p_4 = p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The specific internal energy at state 4 is equal to the specific internal energy at state 3:  
\[
U_4 = U_3 = U_g (\text{from tables}) = 0.0255 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is given by:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{\dot{W}_K + \dot{Q}_K} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{\dot{Q}_{\text{ab}}}
\]
