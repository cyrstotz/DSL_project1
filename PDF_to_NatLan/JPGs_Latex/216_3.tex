TASK 2a  
The page contains a description and diagrams related to the jet engine exergy problem.  

### Text Description:  
- **Stages of the process:**  
  - **0–4:** Irreversible compression.  
  - **1–2:** Reversible compression.  
  - **2–3:** Isobaric combustion.  
  - **3–4:** Turbine operation, irreversible.  
  - **4–5:** Mixing chamber at \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
  - **5–6:** Nozzle operation, expanding from \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) to \( 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), isobaric.  

### Graphs:  
1. **First Graph:**  
   - A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn.  
   - The graph shows multiple curves representing different processes.  
   - The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis, and entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis.  
   - The curves represent the thermodynamic processes of the jet engine, including compression, combustion, turbine operation, and nozzle expansion.  

2. **Second Graph:**  
   - Another \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is shown with labeled states \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \).  
   - Isobars are drawn and labeled as \( p_0 = p_6 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_4 = p_5 \).  
   - The diagram visually represents the thermodynamic processes, including compression, combustion, turbine operation, mixing, and nozzle expansion.  

### Additional Notes:  
- The text mentions "irreversible" and "reversible" processes for compression and turbine operation.  
- The mixing chamber and nozzle expansion are described as isobaric processes.
