The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{Q - Q_f}{Q_g - Q_f}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_g - u_f} = \frac{-185.090 \, \text{kJ} + 333.458 \, \text{kJ}}{-333.458 \, \text{kJ} + 0.045 \, \text{kJ}}
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.555
\]  

The calculation involves the following assumptions:  
- \( 0.06 \, \text{kg} \) of ice and \( 0.04 \, \text{kg} \) of water are present.  

The internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = -333.458 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \cdot 0.06 \, \text{kg} - 0.045 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \cdot 0.04 \, \text{kg} = -20.009 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is given by:  
\[
Q_{12} = \Delta U = u_2 - u_1
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = Q_{12} + u_1 = 15.007 - 20.0097 = -185.090 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The specific internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{u_m}{m} = \frac{-185.090 \, \text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
