TASK 2b  
The outlet velocity \( w_5 \) is given as \( w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s} \).  
The pressure at state 5 is \( p_5 = 0.3 \, \text{bar} \), and the pressure at state 6 is \( p_6 = 0.791 \, \text{bar} \).  
The temperature at state 5 is \( T_5 = 437.9 \, \text{K} \).  

The entropy at state 5 is equal to the entropy at state 6, as the process is reversible and adiabatic:  
\[
S_5 = S_6 \quad \text{(reversible adiabatic process)}
\]

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated using the following expression:  
\[
w_6 = \dot{m} \left( h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \text{ke} \right)
\]

The entropy change is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta S = 0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_5} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)
\]

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific exergy destruction \( \Delta ex_{\text{dest}} \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{dest}} = \left[ h_0 - h_0 - T_0 (s_5 - s_0) + \text{ke} \right] - ex_{\text{str},6}
\]
