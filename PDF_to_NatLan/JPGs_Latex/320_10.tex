TASK 4b  
The energy balance for the process between states 2 and 3 is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_3 - h_2) - \dot{W}_K
\]  
Rearranging to solve for the mass flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

A diagram is sketched showing the relationship between \( h_2 \), \( h_3 \), and \( \dot{W}_K \). The region is labeled "ges√§ttigter Dampf" (saturated vapor).  

TASK 4c  
The enthalpy at state 4 is equal to the enthalpy at state 1 due to the isenthalpic process:  
\[
h_4 = h_1
\]  
From the table, \( h_4 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{\dot{m}_{\text{refrigerant}}}
\]
