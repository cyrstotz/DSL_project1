TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars \( p_0 \) and \( p_5 \), with states 1, 5, and 6 marked. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis in Kelvin (K).  
- \( s \) (specific entropy) on the horizontal axis in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \).  

TASK 2b  
The outlet temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \cdot \frac{0.5^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}}{1.4^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \cdot \frac{0.5^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}}}{1.4^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}}} = 359.20 \, \text{K}
\]  

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_{\text{flow},6} - ex_{\text{flow},1}
\]  
Breaking it down:  
\[
ex_{\text{flow}} = u + \frac{w^2}{2}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u(T = 359.20 \, \text{K}) = \frac{257.29 - 270.02}{10} \cdot 0.3 + 270.02 = 253.1246
\]  
\[
u(T = 293.15 \, \text{K}) = \frac{278.28 - 274.13}{250 - 240} \cdot 3.75 + 274.13 = 273.3823
\]  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = (253.1246 - 273.3823) + \frac{500^2}{2} - \frac{200^2}{2} = -110.129 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

TASK 2d  
The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_6} \right) Q_{46}
\]
