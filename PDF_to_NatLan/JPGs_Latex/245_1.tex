TASK 2a  
The diagram is a \( T \)-\( s \) plot (temperature vs. entropy) illustrating the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine.  
- The y-axis is labeled \( T [K] \) (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The x-axis is labeled \( s [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}] \) (specific entropy).  
- The diagram includes the following points and processes:  
  - Point \( 0 \): Ambient conditions.  
  - Point \( 2 \): After adiabatic, reversible compression.  
  - Point \( 3 \): After adiabatic, irreversible combustion.  
  - Point \( 4/5 \): Mixing chamber.  
  - Point \( 6 \): Nozzle exit.  
- The processes are labeled as "adiabatic, rev." (reversible adiabatic) and "adiabatic, irrev." (irreversible adiabatic).  
- Isobaric lines are shown connecting points.  

TASK 2b  
The temperature \( T_6 \) at the nozzle exit is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \cdot \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is determined using the following relationship:  
\[
w = A \cdot \dot{V} \quad \text{and} \quad w_6 = w_5 \cdot \left( \frac{T_5}{T_6} \right)^{\frac{1}{n-1}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
w_6 = w_5 \cdot \left( \frac{T_5}{T_6} \right)^{\frac{1}{n-1}} = 437.486 \, \text{m/s}
\]
