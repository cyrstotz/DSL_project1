TASK 3c  
For a perfect gas under isobaric conditions:  
\[
m(h_2 - h_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Given \( T_2 = 500 \, \text{K} \), the equation becomes:  
\[
m(c_V + R) \Delta (T_2 - T_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
The heat transfer is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1.367 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

A simple diagram is drawn to represent the system. It shows two chambers labeled "EW" (ice-water mixture) and "Gas," separated by a membrane. Heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) flows from the gas chamber to the EW chamber.

TASK 3d  
The energy balance for the ice-water mixture is given by:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
The specific internal energy \( u_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_1 = u_f(0^\circ\text{C}) + x \left( u_{fg}(0^\circ\text{C}) - u_f(0^\circ\text{C}) \right)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_1 = -0.085 + 0.6 \left( -333.858 + 0.085 \right) = -200.092 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
The specific internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}} + u_1 = -186.418 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The final ice fraction \( x_2 \) is determined using:  
\[
u_2 = u_f + x_2 \left( u_{fg} - u_f \right)
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_{fg} - u_f} = \frac{-186.418 + 0.085}{-333.858 + 0.085} = 0.559
\]  

Thus, the final ice fraction \( x_2 \) is \( 0.559 \).
