TASK 4a  
A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn, showing the phase regions for solid, liquid, and gas. The curve represents the phase boundaries, with labels indicating "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). The diagram includes a marked point labeled "Schluss" (end) and a region labeled "noch nicht gefroren" (not yet frozen). The temperature axis is labeled \( T \), and the pressure axis is labeled \( p \).  

TASK 4b  
A table is presented with columns labeled \( P \), \( V \), \( h \), \( x \), and \( S \). The rows contain values for different states:  
- Row 1: \( P = 1 \), \( V = \), \( h = \), \( x = 1 \), \( S = 0.9294 \)  
- Row 2: \( P = 2 \), \( V = \), \( h = \), \( x = 1 \), \( S = 0.9298 \)  
- Row 3: \( P = 8 \), \( V = \), \( h = \), \( x = 1 \), \( S = 0.9298 \)  
- Row 4: \( P = 8 \), \( V = \), \( h = \), \( x = 0 \), \( S = \)  

Additional notes are written:  
- \( T_i = -70^\circ\text{C} \), \( T_2 = -76^\circ\text{C} \)  
- \( h_2 = 237.74 \), \( S_2 = 0.9298 \)  

TASK 4b (continued calculations)  
The mass flow rate is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\dot{m} (\Delta h) = \dot{W}_{23}
\]  
Rearranging for \( \dot{m} \):  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}}{h_3 - h_2}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{28 \, \text{W}}{277.91 - 237.74} = 0.000634 \, \text{kg/s}
\]  
Converting to hourly flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot 3600 = 3.0 \, \text{kg/h}
\]  

TASK 4b (additional notes)  
The temperature \( T_3 \) is calculated using interpolation:  
\[
T_3 = y_1 + \frac{(x_0 - x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} (y_2 - y_1)
\]  
Where \( x \) represents temperature and \( y \) represents enthalpy.  

Further notes:  
1) \( T \) at \( T_{\text{sat}} \)  
2) \( T \) at \( 40^\circ\text{C} \)  

TASK 4b (final values)  
The temperature \( T_3 \) is determined to be:  
\[
T_3 = 37.86^\circ\text{C}
\]  
The enthalpy \( h_3 \) is given as:  
\[
h_3 = 277.37
\]  

Additional clarification:  
- \( x \) represents temperature.  
- \( y \) represents enthalpy.  
1) \( T \) at \( T_{\text{sat}} \)  
2) \( T \) at \( 40^\circ\text{C} \)
