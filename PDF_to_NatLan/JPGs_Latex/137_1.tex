TASK 1d  
The energy balance for the system is set up to determine the mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) added to the reactor during cooling.  

Given:  
- \( Q = 35000 \, \text{kJ} \)  
- \( x = 0.005 \)  
- \( m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg} \)  
- \( T_1 = 373.15 \, \text{K} \)  

The energy equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = \dot{m}_2 u_2 - \dot{m}_1 u_1 = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} h_{\text{in}} + Q
\]  

Rearranging for \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_1 u_1 - m_2 u_2 + Q}{u_2 - h_{\text{in}}}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_1 u_1 - m_2 u_2 + Q}{u_2 - h_{\text{in}}}
\]  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = 2755.13 \, \text{kg}
\]  

Additional data referenced:  
- \( u_2(20^\circ\text{C}) = 83.86 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  
- \( u_2(70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.55 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  
- \( h_{\text{in}}(20^\circ\text{C}) = 83.86 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)

TASK 1e  
The entropy balance is set up to determine the entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents during cooling.  

The entropy equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = Q \cdot \frac{1}{T} + S_{\text{env}}
\]  

This equation accounts for the entropy transfer due to heat flow and the entropy generated in the environment.
