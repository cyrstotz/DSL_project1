TASK d)  
The rate of change of energy is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_i \dot{m}_i \left[ h_i + ke + pe \right] + \sum_j Q_j - \sum_k W_k
\]  
Here, \( h_i \) represents enthalpy, \( ke \) is kinetic energy, \( pe \) is potential energy, \( Q_j \) denotes heat flow, and \( W_k \) represents work.  

TASK e)  
The entropy change is given by:  
\[
\Delta S = S_2 - S_1 = m \left( s_2 - s_1 \right) = \sum_j \frac{Q_j}{T_j} + S_{\text{ext}}
\]  
Further expanded as:  
\[
-S_{\text{ext}} = \sum_i \dot{m}_i s_i + \sum_j \frac{\dot{Q}_j}{T_j}
\]
