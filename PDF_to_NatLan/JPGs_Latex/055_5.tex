\[
PV = mRT
\]  
For state 2:  
\[
P_{g,2}V_{g,2} = mRT_{g,2}
\]

TASK 3c  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_c - h_a + \frac{w_{c}^2 - w_{a}^2}{2} + q(h_c - h_a) \right) + D_{io} - \sum \dot{W}
\]

TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction is calculated as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{m_{\text{ice}}}{m_{\text{EW}}} = 0.6
\]
