TASK 2a  
The diagram represents a qualitative \( T-s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The graph shows six states labeled \( 1 \) through \( 6 \), with the temperature \( T \) increasing along the vertical axis and entropy \( s \) increasing along the horizontal axis. The pressure \( p \) is indicated as constant at \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) for certain states. The process includes compression (state \( 1 \) to \( 3 \)), combustion (state \( 3 \) to \( 4 \)), turbine expansion (state \( 4 \) to \( 5 \)), and mixing/nozzle exit (state \( 5 \) to \( 6 \)).

TASK 2b  
The energy balance equation for the jet engine is written as:  
\[
\dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} \right) = 0
\]  
From Table A-22, the enthalpy difference \( h_e - h_a \) is calculated using the specific heat capacity \( c_p \) and temperature difference:  
\[
h_e - h_a = c_p (T_2 - T_1) = 1.006 \cdot (526.948 - 431.9) = 95.58 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are given as:  
\[
T_1 = 431.9 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_2 = 431.9 \cdot 1.22 = 526.948 \, \text{K}
\]  

The velocity terms are included in the energy balance:  
\[
95.58 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + \frac{220 \, \text{m/s}^2}{2} - \frac{w_a^2}{2} = 0
\]  
Solving for \( w_a^2 \):  
\[
\frac{w_a^2}{2} = 95580 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}} + 24200 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}
\]
