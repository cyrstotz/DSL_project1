TASK 3b  
The problem involves a perfect gas and the calculation of heat transfer. The following equation is used to describe the heat transfer:  
\[
\Delta Q = m \cdot c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
The specific heat capacity at constant pressure, \( c_p \), is defined as:  
\[
c_p = R + c_v = \frac{R}{M} + c_v
\]  

TASK 3c  
The problem assumes no friction and an isentropic compression or expansion process. The relationship between temperatures and pressures is given by:  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
where \( \kappa = \frac{c_p}{c_v} \). Substituting \( c_p \) and \( c_v \) into \( \kappa \), the expression becomes:  
\[
\kappa = \frac{\frac{R}{M} + c_v}{c_v}
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
\kappa = R/c_v + 1
\]  

It is noted that the pressure does not change:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]  

TASK 3c (continued)  
The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) between states 1 and 2 is calculated using the equation:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_{\text{gas}} \cdot c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Given:  
\[
m_{\text{gas}} = 3.6 \cdot 10^{-2} \, \text{kg}, \quad c_p = \frac{R}{M} + c_v = \frac{8.314 \, \text{J/(mol路K)}}{50 \, \text{kg/kmol}} + 0.633 \, \text{kJ/(kg路K)}
\]  
\[
T_2 = 0.003^\circ\text{C}, \quad T_1 = 500^\circ\text{C}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 3.6 \cdot 10^{-2} \, \text{kg} \cdot \left( \frac{8.314 \, \text{J/(mol路K)}}{50 \, \text{kg/kmol}} + 0.633 \, \text{kJ/(kg路K)} \right) \cdot (0.003^\circ\text{C} - 500^\circ\text{C})
\]  
The result is:  
\[
Q_{12} = -14.356 \, \text{kJ}
\]
