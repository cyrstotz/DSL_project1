The equation for the rate of change of exergy is written as follows:

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{E}_{\text{ex,str}} + \sum \dot{E}_{\text{ex,q}} - \sum \dot{E}_{\text{ex,w}} - \dot{E}_{\text{ex,verl}}
\]

The system is described as stationary and adiabatic. The term \( \dot{E}_{\text{ex,verl}} \) represents exergy losses. 

The calculation for the exergy destruction is shown:

\[
e_{\text{ex,verl}} = e_{\text{ex,str,0}} - e_{\text{ex,str,6}} - e_{\text{ex,q}}
\]

The result is:

\[
e_{\text{ex,verl}} = -120.805 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
