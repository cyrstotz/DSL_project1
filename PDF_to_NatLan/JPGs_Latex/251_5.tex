TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
where:  
\[
h_g = h_g(T_1), \quad h_f = h_f(T_1), \quad h_1 = \text{(to be determined)}
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is given by:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{2u1}}{\dot{W}_{1u1}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{2u1}}{\dot{Q}_{a0b} - \dot{Q}_{2u1}}
\]  

TASK 4e  
The temperature \( T_i \) would decrease slightly and then remain constant as dissipation occurs until equilibrium is reached.
