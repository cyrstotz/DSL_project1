TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn with pressure (\( p \)) on the vertical axis and temperature (\( T \)) in degrees Celsius on the horizontal axis. The graph represents a refrigeration cycle with four labeled states: 1, 2, 3, and 4. The cycle forms a closed loop, with state 1 and state 2 connected by a curve, state 2 and state 3 connected by a straight line, state 3 and state 4 connected by another curve, and state 4 and state 1 connected by a straight line.  

TASK 4b  
The energy balance equation for the refrigerant R134a is written as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_2 - h_1) + \dot{Q}_K = 0
\]  
Rearranging the equation gives:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = -\frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h_2 - h_1}
\]  
The temperature of the evaporator (\( T_v \)) is defined as:  
\[
T_v = T_i - 6 \, \text{K}
\]  

Additional crossed-out content includes an alternative energy balance equation:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_3 - h_2) + \dot{W}_K = 0
\]  
Rearranging gives:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
This part is crossed out and not considered further.  

TASK 4  
The enthalpy at state 2 is given as:  
\[
h_2 (8 \, \text{bar}, x = 1) = 255.05 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
From Table A8, the temperature at state 2 (\( T_{h2} \)) is:  
\[
T_{h2} = 15.45^\circ\text{C}
\]  
The temperature difference from state 2 to state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta T \, \text{from 2 to 1} = 6^\circ\text{C} \implies T_1 = 9.45^\circ\text{C}
\]
