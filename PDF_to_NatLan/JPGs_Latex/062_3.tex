TASK 1d  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta U = \Delta m_{12} h_{\text{in}} - Q_{R,12} - m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1
\]  
Rearranging to solve for \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 + Q_{R,12}}{h_{\text{in}}}
\]  

From Table A-2, \( h_{\text{in}} \) at \( T_{\text{in}} = 20^\circ\text{C} \) is referenced as \( h_f(20^\circ\text{C}) = 83.96 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).  

TASK 1e  
The entropy change of the reactor contents is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = \Delta m_{12} s_{\text{in}} + \frac{Q_{R}}{T} + \Delta S_{\text{gen}}
\]
