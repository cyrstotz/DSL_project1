TASK 1d  
In the reactor, the change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is equal to the heat released \( Q_{12} \):  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot (u_2 - u_1)
\]  

The specific internal energy at state 1 (\( u_1 \)) is calculated using the steam quality \( x_D = 0.005 \) and the saturated liquid and vapor values from Table A2:  
\[
u_1 = (1 - x) \cdot u_f + x \cdot u_g  
\]  
\[
u_1 = 0.995 \cdot 418.34 \, \text{kJ/kg} + 0.005 \cdot 2505.6 \, \text{kJ/kg}  
\]  
\[
u_1 = 423.38 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The specific internal energy at state 2 (\( u_2 \)) corresponds to saturated liquid at \( 70^\circ \text{C} \), taken from Table A2:  
\[
u_2 = 292.35 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The total heat released during cooling (\( Q_{12} \)) is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_{\text{total}} \cdot (u_2 - u_1)  
\]  
\[
Q_{12} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \cdot (292.35 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 423.38 \, \text{kJ/kg})  
\]  
\[
Q_{12} = -785154 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The mass of saturated liquid water added (\( \Delta m_{12} \)) is determined using the energy balance:  
\[
-Q_{12} = \Delta m_{12} \cdot (u_2 - u_3)
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{-Q_{12}}{u_2 - u_3}
\]  

The specific internal energy at state 3 (\( u_3 \)) corresponds to saturated liquid at \( 20^\circ \text{C} \), taken from Table A2:  
\[
u_3 = 83.85 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{785154 \, \text{kJ}}{292.35 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 83.85 \, \text{kJ/kg}}  
\]  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{785154 \, \text{kJ}}{208.5 \, \text{kJ/kg}}  
\]  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = 3756.71 \, \text{kg}
\]

TASK 1e  
The entropy change of the reactor contents (\( \Delta S_{12} \)) is calculated as the sum of the reactor entropy change and the entropy change due to the added mass:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = \Delta S_{\text{Reactor}} + \Delta S_{\text{added mass}}
\]  

The reactor entropy change (\( \Delta S_{\text{Reactor}} \)) is:  
\[
\Delta S_{\text{Reactor}} = m_{\text{total}} \cdot (s_2 - s_1)
\]  

The specific entropy at state 1 (\( s_1 \)) is calculated using the steam quality \( x_D = 0.005 \) and the saturated liquid and vapor values from Table A2:  
\[
s_1 = (1 - x) \cdot s_f + x \cdot s_g  
\]  
\[
s_1 = 0.995 \cdot 1.3069 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} + 0.005 \cdot 7.358 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}  
\]  
\[
s_1 = 1.337 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

The specific entropy at state 2 (\( s_2 \)) corresponds to saturated liquid at \( 70^\circ \text{C} \), taken from Table A2. \( s_2 \) is not explicitly calculated on this page.  

Further calculations for \( \Delta S_{\text{added mass}} \) and \( \Delta S_{12} \) are incomplete or not visible.
