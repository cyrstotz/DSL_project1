TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) (in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in degrees Celsius) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts the freeze-drying process.  
- Two regions are labeled: "test" and "fissing gas."  
- Two steps are marked as \( (i) \) and \( (ii) \), with arrows indicating transitions between states.  
- The graph includes phase boundaries and transitions, but specific numerical values are not provided.

TASK 4b  
The temperature and pressure values for different states are listed:  
\[
\begin{aligned}
T_2 &= -40^\circ\text{C}, \quad P_3 &= 8 \, \text{bar}, \quad T_3 &= -40^\circ\text{C}, \\
P_1 &= P_2, \quad P_2 &= P_1, \quad P_3 &= 8 \, \text{bar}, \quad P_4 &= 5 \, \text{bar}, \quad x_4 &= 0.
\end{aligned}
\]

The initial temperature \( T_i \) is given as \( -100^\circ\text{C} \), and the final temperature \( T_2 = T_3 = -40^\circ\text{C} \).  

The process between states 2 and 3 is described as "23 process."

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a \right] + Q_{23}^0 - \dot{W}_K
\]  
The mass flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_e - h_a}
\]  
The enthalpy at state \( e \) is given as:  
\[
h_e = h_g(-40^\circ\text{C}) = 244.9 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
The enthalpy at state \( a \) is not provided.

TASK 4d  
The entropy change is calculated as:  
\[
S_4 - S_4 = S_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 0.35 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}, \quad P_3 = P_4
\]  
The entropy difference is expressed as:  
\[
h_4 = \frac{S_4 - S_f(-40^\circ\text{C})}{S_g(-40^\circ\text{C}) - S_f(-40^\circ\text{C})} = 0.23
\]
