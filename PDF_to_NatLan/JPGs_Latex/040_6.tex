TASK 4a  
A diagram is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) cycle. The axes are labeled as \( p \) in bar and \( T \) in Kelvin. The cycle consists of four states labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), and \( 4 \), connected by arrows indicating the process flow. The processes are described as follows:  
- \( 1 \to 2 \): Isentropic compression  
- \( 2 \to 3 \): Isentropic process  
- \( 3 \to 4 \): Isobaric process  
- \( 4 \to 1 \): Pressure reduction  

TASK 4b  
The equation for heat transfer is given as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
The evaporator temperature is defined as \( T_i \), and the heat transfer \( \dot{Q}_K \) is specified as \( -6 \, \text{K} \).  

The enthalpies are described as:  
\[
h_1 = h_f(-6 \, \text{K}), \quad h_2 = h_g(-6 \, \text{K})
\]  

TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{s - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]
