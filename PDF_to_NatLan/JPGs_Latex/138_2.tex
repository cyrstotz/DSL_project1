TASK 2a  
The page begins with a graph labeled \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (specific entropy) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts three distinct states connected by lines:  
1. The first state (\( s_1 \)) is at the lowest entropy and temperature.  
2. The second state (\( s_2 \)) is at a higher entropy and temperature, connected to \( s_1 \) by a steep upward curve.  
3. The third state (\( s_3 \)) is at an even higher entropy but the same temperature as \( s_2 \), connected by a horizontal line.  

The graph is annotated with the following descriptions:  
1. "adiabatic, reversible \( \Rightarrow s_1 = s_2 \)"  
2. "isobar, isothermal \( \Rightarrow s_2 \rightarrow s_3 \)"  
3. "T_0 \rightarrow T_2"  

TASK 2b  
The energy equation for the system is written under the assumption of steady-state conditions:  
\[
\dot{m} \left( \frac{w_2^2}{2} + h_2 \right) - \dot{m} \left( \frac{w_1^2}{2} + h_1 \right) = 0
\]  

The following calculations are performed:  
The temperature at state \( s_5 \) is given as \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \), and the table A-22 is referenced for data. The pressure \( p_5 \) is noted as \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  

The enthalpy \( h_2 \) at \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \) is calculated using table data:  
\[
h_2(T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}) = \frac{h_{g}(431.9) - h_{f}(431.9)}{104} \cdot (1.431) + h_{f}(431.9) = 133.36
\]  

The enthalpy \( h_a \) at \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) is calculated using interpolation:  
\[
h_a(0.5 \, \text{bar}) = h_{g,0.5 \, \text{bar}} - h_{f,0.5 \, \text{bar}} \cdot (0.5 - 0.4690) + h_{f,0.4690}
\]
