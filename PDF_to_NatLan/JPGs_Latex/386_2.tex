TASK 2a  
The page begins with a graph labeled as a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram qualitatively represents the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. The axes are labeled:  
- The vertical axis is \( T \) (temperature) in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is \( s \) (specific entropy) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \).  

The process includes the following states:  
- State \( 0 \): Ambient conditions, \( p = p_0 \).  
- State \( 1 \): Compression to \( p = p_1 \).  
- State \( 2 \): Further compression to \( p = p_2 \).  
- State \( 3 \): Combustion at constant pressure \( p = p_2 \).  
- State \( 4 \): Expansion through the turbine, \( p' = p_4 \).  
- State \( 5 \): Mixing chamber, \( p = p_5 \).  
- State \( 6 \): Nozzle exit, \( p = p_0 \).  

Dashed lines represent isobars for \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_5 \). The process paths are curved, indicating changes in entropy and temperature during compression, combustion, and expansion.

TASK 2b  
The energy balance for the entire turbine is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a) - \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}} - \dot{W}_b
\]  
This equation is partially crossed out and not fully legible.  

The energy balance for the nozzle is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2}) + \dot{Q} \quad \text{(adiabatic, isobaric)}
\]  

Further, the entropy balance for the nozzle is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (s_5 - s_6) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T}
\]  
This equation is labeled as "adiabatic reversible."  

The entropy change is calculated as:  
\[
s_5 - s_6 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_5}{T_6} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_5}{p_6} \right) = 0
\]  

The temperature \( T_6 \) is determined as:  
\[
T_6 = 328.675 \, \text{K}
\]  

The enthalpy difference \( h_5 - h_6 \) is calculated using:  
\[
h_5 - h_6 = c_p (T_5 - T_6) = 109.998 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated as:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 (h_5 - h_6) + w_5^2} = 507.29 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\]

TASK 2c  
The specific heat capacities are provided:  
\[
c_v = \frac{c_p}{\kappa} = 0.7185 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
\[
R = c_p - c_v = 0.2889 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]
