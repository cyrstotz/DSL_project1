TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{U_2 - U_{\text{fussig}}}{U_{\text{fest}} - U_{\text{fussig}}}
\]  

With substitution:  
\[
Q_{12} = 1500 \, \text{J}
\]  

Additionally:  
\[
U_2 = Q_{12}
\]  
\[
U_2 = \frac{U}{m_{\text{Eis},2}}
\]
