TASK 4c  
The temperature \( T_2 \) is given as \( -22^\circ\text{C} \).  

The entropy \( s \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
s = s_f + x \cdot (s_g - s_f)
\]  
Rearranging for \( x \):  
\[
x = \frac{s - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]  

The entropy at state 3 (\( s_3 \)) is equal to \( s_2 \) because the compression is isentropic.  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance (\( \epsilon_K \)) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{2 \dot{W}}
\]  

TASK 4e  
The food would continue to cool further if the heat flow \( \dot{Q}_K \) remained constant, as the system would eventually reach \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).
