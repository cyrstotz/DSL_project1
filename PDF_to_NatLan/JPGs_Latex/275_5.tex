The pressure is given as \( p = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \), and the temperature is \( T = 0^\circ\text{C} \). All other values are assumed to be at \( 1.4 \, \text{bar} \) and referenced to Table 1.

The internal energy \( U_1 \) is calculated as:
\[
U_1 = 0.64 \, u_{\text{f}}(0^\circ\text{C}) = -200.09 \, \text{kJ/kg} \times 0.0009
\]

The change in energy \( \Delta E \) is expressed as:
\[
\Delta E = \Delta U = m_w \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = \Delta Q + W
\]

The equation for \( U_2 \) is:
\[
U_2 = \frac{Q_1 + m_w \cdot u_1}{m_w} = -273.28 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 1.89 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The ice fraction \( x_2 \) is calculated using:
\[
x_2 = \frac{U_2 - U_{\text{liq}}}{U_{\text{fus}} - U_{\text{liq}}} = 0.64406 = 1.5607
\]
