TASK 2a

The page contains two diagrams related to thermodynamic processes:

1. **Top Diagram**:
   - The graph is a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram.
   - The curve includes labeled points: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
   - The process appears to represent a thermodynamic cycle, with transitions between states marked by curved and straight lines.
   - The lines connecting the points suggest isobaric and adiabatic processes, typical of jet engine cycles.

2. **Bottom Diagram**:
   - The graph is also a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram.
   - The curve includes labeled points: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
   - This diagram appears to depict a more detailed thermodynamic cycle, with additional points and transitions compared to the top diagram.
   - The lines connecting the points suggest similar thermodynamic processes, such as compression, heat addition, and expansion.
