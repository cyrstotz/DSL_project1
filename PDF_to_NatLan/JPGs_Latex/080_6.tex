TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram. The diagram includes two isochoric lines labeled "isochore 1" and "isochore 2." Four states are marked: (1), (2), (3), and (4). The states are connected by arrows indicating the process flow.  

TASK 4b  
An energy balance is written for the compressor and nozzle system.  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_c - h_a) - \dot{W}_K \quad \Rightarrow \quad \dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_c - h_a}
\]  
The enthalpy after the throttle is given as:  
\[
h = 243.78 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \(x_1\) after the throttle is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{\Phi - \Phi_f}{\Phi_g - \Phi_f} \quad \text{with} \quad \Phi = v, u, h, s
\]  
The enthalpy after the throttle is stated as:  
\[
h = 243.78 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
It is noted that the throttle process is isenthalpic by definition.
