TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) are calculated as follows:  

\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{32 \cdot g}{A_{\text{piston}}} \cdot 10^{-5} + \frac{0.1 \cdot g}{A_{\text{membrane}}} \cdot 10^{-5} = 1.4001 \, \text{bar}
\]

The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is determined as:  
\[
A_{\text{cylinder}} = 0.05 \, \pi \cdot D^2 = 0.005 \, \pi \, \text{m}^2
\]

The number of moles of gas is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
n = \frac{p V}{R T} = 0.0684 \, \text{mol}
\]

The volume of the gas is:  
\[
V_g = 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3
\]

The molar mass of the gas is given as:  
\[
M_g = 50 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The mass of the gas is:  
\[
m_g = n \cdot M_g = 3.419 \, \text{g}
\]

TASK 3b  
The gas pressure in state 2 is equal to the gas pressure in state 1:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]

The mass does not change, and the pressure remains constant:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 1.4001 \, \text{bar}
\]

TASK 3c  
The heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta U_{g} = Q_{12} = -1082.23 \, \text{kJ}
\]

The change in internal energy is:  
\[
\Delta u = u(T_2) - u(T_1) = c_V (T_2 - T_1) = -31.496 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The final temperature of the gas is:  
\[
T_2 = 0.003^\circ \text{C}
\]

---

TASK 3d  
The specific internal energy of the ice-water mixture is calculated as:  
\[
u_{\text{EW}} = y_{\text{fluid,EW}} + x_{\text{ice},1} (u_{\text{fluid,ice}} - u_{\text{fluid,EW}})
\]

At \( 0^\circ \text{C} \):  
\[
u_{\text{fluid,EW}} = -333.45 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad u_{\text{fluid,ice}} = -0.045 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The specific internal energy is:  
\[
u_{\text{EW}} = -200.0928 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The total internal energy is:  
\[
U_{\text{EW}} = u_{\text{EW}} \cdot m_{\text{EW}} = -200.0928 \cdot 0.1 = -20.009 \, \text{kJ}
\]
