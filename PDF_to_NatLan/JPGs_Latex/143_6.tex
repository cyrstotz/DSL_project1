TASK 3c  
The temperature of the gas in state 2 is given as \( T_{g,2} = 0.003^\circ\text{C} \).  

An energy balance for the gas is applied:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12} - \int_{1}^{2} p \, dV
\]  
For an isobaric process, this simplifies to:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12} - p_1 (V_2 - V_1)
\]  

The volume \( V_2 \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m R T_2}{p_2} = 0.007 \, \text{m}^3
\]  

The change in specific internal energy is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_V (T_2 - T_1) = -316.498 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is determined using the energy balance equation:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g (u_2 - u_1) + p_1 (V_2 - V_1) = -1398.9 \, \text{kJ} = -1400 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{u_{2,\text{eis}} - u_f}{u_{\text{fus}} - u_f}
\]
