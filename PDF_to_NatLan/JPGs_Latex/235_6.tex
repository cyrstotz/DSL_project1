TASK 4a  
The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process.  
- The graph includes labeled phase regions with a triple point marked.  
- The process involves isobaric and isothermal transitions between states labeled as 1, 2, and 3.  
- State 1 is below the triple point, and the transitions are shown with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  

TASK 4b  
The temperature at state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
T_2 = T_i - 6 \, \text{K} = 257.15 \, \text{K} = -16^\circ\text{C}
\]

Using Table A-10:  
The enthalpy at state 2 (\(h_2\)) is:  
\[
h_2 = h_{\text{fg}}(T_2) = 237.74 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The entropy at state 2 (\(s_2\)) is:  
\[
s_2 = s_g(T_2) = 0.9298 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} = s_3
\]

The enthalpy at state 3 (\(h_3\)) is calculated using the entropy difference:  
\[
h_3 = h(8 \, \text{bar}, s_3) = h(8 \, \text{bar}, 0.9066 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}) + s_3 - 0.9066
\]

From Table A-12:  
\[
h(8 \, \text{bar}, 0.9066 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}) = 271.31 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The enthalpy at state 3 (\(h_3\)) is further refined:  
\[
h(8 \, \text{bar}, 0.9066 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}) = 284.15 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The enthalpy at state 1 (\(h_1\)) is:  
\[
h(8 \, \text{bar}, 0.9377 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}) = 273.66 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
