TASK 3c  
At state 2, equilibrium is reached, and the change in internal energy (\( \Delta U \)) is zero:  
\[
\Delta U = \Delta U_{\text{gas}} + \Delta U_{\text{EW}}
\]  
For the gas:  
\[
\Delta U_{\text{gas}} = c_V (T_{g2} - T_{g1})
\]  
For the ice-water mixture (EW):  
\[
\Delta U_{\text{EW}} = c_{\text{if}} (T_{2\text{EW}} - T_{1\text{EW}})
\]  

It is given that \( T_{g2} = T_{2\text{EW}} = 0.003^\circ\text{C} \).  

Using the energy balance:  
\[
\Delta E = Q - W_v = 0
\]  
Thus:  
\[
Q = W_v \quad \Rightarrow \quad q = w_v = \frac{R(T_2 - T_1)}{1 - n}
\]  
Where \( R = \frac{c_V (k - 1)}{R} + 1 = k \).  

A small sketch is shown, depicting a closed system with heat transfer \( Q \).  

TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated.  

The equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture is given as:  
\[
T_{\text{EW}} = 0.003^\circ\text{C}
\]  

The initial ice fraction is:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},1} = \frac{m_{\text{ice}}}{m_{\text{EW}}} = 0.6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad m_{\text{ice}} = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The energy balance for the ice-water mixture is:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_{\text{if}} (T_2 - T_1) + u_1
\]  
Interpolation is required to determine the vapor quality \( x \):  
\[
x = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_g - u_f}
\]  

At \( p = 1 \, \text{bar} \) and \( T = 0.003^\circ\text{C} \), interpolation is performed to find \( x \).  

The specific internal energy \( u_2 \) is given as:  
\[
u_2 = 33.45 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Further calculations involve interpolating between \( u_g \) and \( u_f \) values from tables.
