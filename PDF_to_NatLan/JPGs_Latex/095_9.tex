TASK c  
The general system is described as follows:  

The change in internal energy is given by:  
\[
\Delta U = \dot{Q}_{12} - \dot{W}_{12}
\]  

The energy balance for the system is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} \left( u_2 - u_1 \right) = Q_{12} - \int p \, dV
\]  

**Diagram Description:**  
A rectangular box is drawn, representing the system. An arrow labeled \( Q_{12} \) points outward from the box, indicating heat transfer.
