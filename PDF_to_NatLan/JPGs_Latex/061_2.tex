TASK 2a  
The page contains a graph illustrating a thermodynamic process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) diagram.  

**Graph Description:**  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as entropy (\( S \)) with units \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).  
- The vertical axis is labeled as temperature (\( T \)) with unspecified units.  
- The graph consists of six distinct points labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \), connected by curves representing different thermodynamic processes.  
- The process begins at point \( 1 \), moves to point \( 2 \) with a steep upward curve, then transitions to point \( 3 \) with a shallower slope.  
- Between points \( 3 \) and \( 4 \), the curve flattens, indicating an isobaric process.  
- From point \( 4 \) to \( 5 \), the curve slopes downward, and finally, from point \( 5 \) to \( 6 \), the curve drops steeply.  
- The region between points \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) is shaded with diagonal lines, possibly indicating a phase change or specific thermodynamic behavior.
