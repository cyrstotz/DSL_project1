TASK 4a  
The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes the following labeled regions and points:  
- "Fest" (solid phase)  
- "Flüssig" (liquid phase)  
- "Gasförmig" (gaseous phase)  
- The "Triple" point, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist.  
- Two steps labeled as "i" and "ii" along the curve.  
- The curve is marked as "isotherm" (constant temperature) and "isobar" (constant pressure).  

The graph visually represents the transitions between phases during the freeze-drying process.

TASK 4b  
The total mass flow rate of the refrigerant (\( \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \)) is calculated using the following equations:  

1. The inlet temperature of the evaporator is given as \( T_{\text{in}} = T_i - 6 \, \text{K} = 3^\circ \text{C} \).  
2. The first law of thermodynamics around the compressor is applied:  
   \[
   0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] + \dot{W}_K
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( \dot{m} \):  
   \[
   \dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
   \]  

3. \( h_3 \) is obtained from Table A-12 at 8 bar using interpolation:  
   \[
   y = x - x_1 \cdot \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} + y_1
   \]  
   Where:  
   - \( x_1 = -6^\circ \text{C} \), \( x_2 = 2^\circ \text{C} \)  
   - \( y_1 = 234.08 \, \text{kJ/kg} \), \( y_2 = 247.23 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

   After interpolation, \( h_3 = 247.23 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

4. \( h_2 \) is determined at \( T_2 = -22^\circ \text{C} \), where the refrigerant is fully evaporated:  
   \[
   h_2 = 234.08 \, \text{kJ/kg}
   \]  

Descriptions of interpolations and calculations are provided to determine the enthalpy values at specific states.
