TASK 3b  

The pressure is constant, leading to the following relationship for temperature:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \left( \frac{V_{2,\text{ig}}}{V_{1,\text{ig}}} \right)
\]  

The specific volume of the gas is expressed as:  
\[
V_{2,\text{ig}} = -W_v + V_2
\]  
where \( W_v \) is the work done and \( V_2 \) is the final volume.  

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} (\ldots) + \dot{Q}_{12} - W_v
\]  

The change in internal energy is given by:  
\[
\Delta u_{\text{internal}} = Q_{12} - W_v
\]  

The entropy generation is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta s_{\text{gen}} = \dot{Q}_{12} - W_v
\]  

From this, \( W_v \) can be determined.

TASK 3c  

The ice fraction at state 2 is given as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.005
\]  

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} (\ldots) + \dot{Q}_{12} - W_v
\]  

The change in energy is expressed as:  
\[
dE = m_g \cdot \Delta u_g = m_g \cdot c_v (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

Assuming constant pressure:  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{V_1}
\]  

The final volume is calculated as:  
\[
V_2 = 1.109 \, \text{L}
\]  

The work done is:  
\[
W_v = (V_2 - V_1) \cdot p = -284.28 \, \text{J}
\]  

The heat transfer is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{12} = -1082.96 \, \text{J} + 284.28 \, \text{J} = -798.68 \, \text{J} - 1367.24 \, \text{J}
\]  

After correction:  
\[
|\dot{Q}_{12}| = 157.26 \, \text{J}
\]
