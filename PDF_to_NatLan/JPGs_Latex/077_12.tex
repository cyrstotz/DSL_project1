The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is to be determined.  

The mass flow rate of R134a is given as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = 4 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{h}}
\]  
The temperature \( T_2 \) is specified as:  
\[
T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C}
\]  

If \( x_1 = 0 \), the refrigerant is completely liquid.  

The formula for vapor quality \( x_1 \) is:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{s_1 - s_{1,f}}{s_{1,g} - s_{1,f}}
\]  

The process is adiabatic, with pressure equal to the ambient pressure.  

Using the entropy balance:  
\[
\dot{m} \, (s_4 - s_1) + \sum \frac{\dot{Q}_i}{T_i} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 0
\]  
Here, the term \(\sum \frac{\dot{Q}_i}{T_i}\) is zero for an adiabatic process.
