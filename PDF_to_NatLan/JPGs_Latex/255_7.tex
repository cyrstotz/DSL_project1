TASK 2d  
Stationary flow process:  
\[
\dot{e}_{\text{ex,ver}} = \Delta e_{\text{exist}} + \Delta e_{\text{ex,iq}} - \frac{w_t}{\dot{m}_{\text{ins}}}
\]  
Here, \( w_t \to 0 \), because all turbine power is used for the compressors.  

\[
\Delta e_{\text{ex,iq}} = \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_B} \right) q_B = 969.58 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
\[
e_{\text{ex,ver}} = 7710.38 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

TASK 4a  
A diagram is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The diagram includes phase regions labeled as "sublimation," "triple point," and "cooling cycle." Several arrows and lines are drawn to indicate transitions between states, including states labeled as "1," "2," and "3." However, the diagram is heavily crossed out and unclear.
