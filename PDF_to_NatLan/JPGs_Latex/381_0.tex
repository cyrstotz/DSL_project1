TASK 1a  
The diagram at the top of the page represents a reactor system with labeled inlet and outlet streams. The horizontal lines indicate temperature levels, with "ein" (inlet) and "sieden" (boiling) marked.  

The reactor operates under the following conditions:  
- Mass flow rate at the inlet: \( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \).  
- Inlet temperature: \( T_{\text{in}} = 70^\circ\text{C} \), which corresponds to saturated liquid.  
- Total reactor mass: \( m_{\text{total},1} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \).  
- Steam quality: \( x_D = 0.005 \).  
- Reactor temperature: \( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \), which is also saturated liquid.  

TASK 1a  
a) Determination of heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \):  
The heat flow removed by the coolant is calculated using the energy balance equation:  
\[
Q_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_R \cdot W_{\text{in}}
\]  
Simplified:  
\[
Q_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (h_a - h_e) = 37.8 \, \text{kW}
\]  

From the water tables:  
- Enthalpy at \( 70^\circ\text{C} \):  
\[
h_a = h_f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.58 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
- Enthalpy at \( 100^\circ\text{C} \):  
\[
h_e = h_f(100^\circ\text{C}) = 419.04 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Both values correspond to saturated liquid conditions.
