TASK 2a  
The equation for determining \( x \) is given as:  
\[
x = \frac{y_1 - y_4}{y_4 - y_2}
\]  

The expression for \( y_1 \) is:  
\[
y_1 = \frac{1}{\bar{T}_1} - \frac{1}{\bar{T}_4}
\]  

The expression for \( y_4 \) is:  
\[
y_4 = \frac{1}{\bar{T}_4} - \frac{1}{\bar{T}_2}
\]  

The expression for \( y_2 \) is:  
\[
y_2 = \frac{1}{\bar{T}_2} - \frac{1}{\bar{T}_1}
\]  

TASK 2b  
A graph is drawn, resembling a T-s diagram. The graph includes the following annotations:  
- A curve labeled "Sublimation" with an upward slope.  
- A point labeled "1" near the sublimation curve.  
- A point labeled "2" further along the curve.  
- Arrows indicating transitions between states.  
- The axes are not explicitly labeled, but the curve suggests temperature and entropy relationships.  

No additional textual explanation is provided for the graph.
