TASK 3c  
The first law of thermodynamics is applied to a closed system with \( U = 0 \).  

The heat transferred, \( Q_{12} \), is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot \Delta T
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
\[
Q_{12} = 0.0036 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.63 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot (-449.387)
\]  
\[
Q_{12} = -1.1394 \, \text{kJ} = -1139.4 \, \text{J}
\]
