TASK 2a  
The equation for exergy balance is written as:  
\[
0 = m_{\text{ges}} \Delta ex_{\text{strom}} + \dot{Z} - \dot{W} - \dot{Ex}_{\text{verl}}
\]  

The work output is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{W}_{\text{out}} =
\]  

The exergy loss is given by:  
\[
\dot{Ex}_{\text{verl}} = m_{\text{ges}} \Delta ex_{\text{strom}} - \dot{W}
\]
