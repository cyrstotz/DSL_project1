TASK 2a  
The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and process paths:  
- Points 1 to 2 represent an isentropic compression.  
- Points 2 to 3 represent heat addition at constant pressure (isobaric combustion).  
- Points 3 to 4 represent an isentropic expansion through the turbine.  
- Points 4 to 5 represent mixing at constant pressure.  
- Points 5 to 6 represent an isentropic expansion through the nozzle.  
The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (entropy), with entropy measured in \( \text{kJ/kg·K} \).  

TASK 2b  
The equation for the outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is derived using the energy balance:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \left[ h_5 - h_0 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} \right] - \dot{W}_v
\]  
where \( w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s} \).  

The enthalpy difference \( h_5 - h_0 \) is calculated as:  
\[
h_5 - h_0 = \int_{T_0}^{T_5} c_p(T) \, dT = \Delta T \cdot c_p = \left[ 431.9 \, \text{K} - T_0 \right] \cdot 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is then determined using:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{-\left( \frac{\dot{W}_v}{\dot{m}_{\text{gas}}} + h_0 - h_5 \right) 2 + w_5^2}
\]  

The work term \( \dot{W}_v \) is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{W}_v = \int_1^2 p \, dV = \frac{1}{\kappa - 1} \left( p_2 v_2 - p_0 v_0 \right) = R \left( T_5 - T_0 \right)
\]  
where \( p v = R T \), \( R = c_p - c_v \), and \( \kappa = \frac{c_p}{c_v} \).  

Constants used:  
\[
R = c_p - c_v = 0.287 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}, \quad \kappa = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = 1.4, \quad c_p = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}, \quad c_v = \frac{c_p}{\kappa} = \frac{1.006}{1.4} = 0.719 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}.
