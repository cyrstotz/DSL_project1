TASK 2a  
The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( S \) (temperature-entropy) plot.  

- The x-axis is labeled as \( S \) (entropy), and the y-axis is labeled as \( T \) (temperature).  
- The graph shows a process with multiple states labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- The curve from state 1 to state 2 appears to represent an increase in entropy.  
- The curve from state 2 to state 3 is downward, indicating a decrease in temperature and entropy.  
- The curve from state 3 to state 4 is vertical, suggesting an isentropic process (constant entropy).  
- The label "isentrop" is written near the vertical line between states 3 and 4.
