TASK 3a  
In equilibrium:  
The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is calculated as:  
\[
A = \pi r^2 = 7.85 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^2
\]  
where \( r = \frac{d}{2} \).  

The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is determined using:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_0 + \frac{m_K g}{A} + \frac{m_{\text{EW}} g}{A} = 1.48 \, \text{bar}
\]  

For a perfect gas:  
The equation of state is:  
\[
p V = m R T
\]  
The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{R_{\text{universal}}}{M} = \frac{8.314 \, \text{J/mol路K}}{50 \, \text{kg/kmol}} = 166.28 \, \text{J/kg路K}
\]  

The gas mass \( m_g \) is determined as:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} = \frac{1.48 \, \text{bar} \cdot 3.14 \, \text{L}}{166.28 \, \text{J/kg路K} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K}} = 3.429 \, \text{kg}
\]

TASK 3b  
Given \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \):  
The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) must remain constant at equilibrium with the ice-water mixture.  

Thermal equilibrium in state 2 implies:  
The temperatures are equal:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  
This is because the system is at the melting point of ice and water in equilibrium.

TASK 3c  
For a perfect gas, the energy balance is:  
\[
\Delta E = m \cdot (U_2 - U_1) = Q - W
\]  

The transferred heat \( Q_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot (U_2 - U_1) + W = 7.85 \, \text{kJ} + (-366.633 \, \text{kJ}) = -366.633 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The work \( W \) is given by:  
\[
W = p_0 \cdot (V_2 - V_1) = -284.23 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The heat transfer is also expressed as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = 3.429 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg路K} \cdot (273.15 \, \text{K} - 773.15 \, \text{K}) = -1350.15333 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

Final result:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1350.15333 \, \text{kJ}
\]
