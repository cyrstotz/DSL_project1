TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn representing the process in a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T [K] \), representing temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( s [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}] \), representing specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.  

The diagram shows six states labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \), connected by curves and lines.  
- States \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) are connected by a curve.  
- States \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) are connected by a vertical line.  
- States \( 3 \) and \( 4 \) are connected by a curve.  
- States \( 4 \) and \( 5 \) are connected by a diagonal line.  
- States \( 5 \) and \( 6 \) are connected by a curve.  

The pressures \( p_0 \), \( p_3 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_5 \) are marked along the curves, indicating isobars (lines of constant pressure).

TASK 2b  
The reversible adiabatic isentropic relation is derived:  
\[
p_6 = p_5
\]
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]
where \( n = \kappa = 1.4 \).  

The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated as:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \cdot \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.3 \, \text{K} \cdot \left( \frac{0.831}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]
Thus, \( T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K} \).

The steady-state energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2}{2} - \frac{w_a^2}{2} \right]
\]
where \( h_s - h_c = c_p (T_s - T_c) \).  

Substituting values:  
\[
h_s - h_c = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \cdot (431.3 \, \text{K} - 328.07 \, \text{K}) = 104.45 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The outlet velocity \( w_a \) is calculated as:  
\[
w_a = \sqrt{\frac{104.45 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \cdot 2 + (220 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}})^2}{1}}
\]
\[
w_a = 390.96 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\]  

Thus, \( w_a = 390.96 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \).
