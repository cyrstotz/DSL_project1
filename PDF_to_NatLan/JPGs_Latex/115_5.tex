TASK 2a  
The page contains mathematical derivations related to jet engine exergy calculations. The following equations and expressions are visible:

1. The equation for outlet velocity \( w_6 \):
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{w_5^2 + \frac{2 \dot{m}_K}{\dot{m}_M} \left( h_5 - h_6 \right)}
\]

2. The expression for the temperature difference:
\[
T_6 = T_5 - \frac{w_6^2 - w_5^2}{2 c_p}
\]

3. The mass-specific increase in flow exergy:
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_{\text{flow},6} - ex_{\text{flow},0}
\]

4. The entropy production term:
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_R}{T_{\text{Reactor},1}} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}}
\]

5. The energy balance equation:
\[
\dot{E}_{\text{in}} - \dot{E}_{\text{out}} + \dot{E}_{\text{gen}} = 0
\]
