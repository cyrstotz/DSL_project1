TASK 4c  
The vapor quality at state 1 is denoted as \( x_1 \). The temperature \( T_i \) remains constant.

---

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{abl}}}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{abl}}}{28 \, \text{W}}
\]

---

TASK 4e  
The temperature would continue to decrease further. If the walls are assumed to be perfectly insulated, then there is only one heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{abl}} \), which causes the temperature to drop.
