TASK 1d  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i \left( h_i + \frac{v_i^2}{2} + gz_i \right) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
\Delta E - m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m + Q - W
\]  
where \( h = u + pv \).

TASK 1e  
The entropy change is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta S = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1
\]
