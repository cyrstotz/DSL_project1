TASK 1d  
The rate of change of energy in the system is given by:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \left( h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}} \right) + \Delta m_{12} h_{\text{reactor}} + \dot{Q}
\]  

TASK 1e  
The entropy change of the reactor contents between states 1 and 2 is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \left( s_2 - s_1 \right)
\]
