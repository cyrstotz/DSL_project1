TASK 3a  
The ideal gas law is applied:  
\[
pV = mRT
\]  
The total mass of the ice-water mixture is given as \( m_{\text{EW}} + m_{\text{ice}} = 0.16 \, \text{kg} \).  

The force balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Sigma F = 0
\]  
The pressure at state 1 is calculated using:  
\[
p_{g,1} A - 0.1 \, g - 32 \, g - p_{\text{amb}} A = 0
\]  
Rearranging for \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{(0.1 + 32) \, g}{A} + p_{\text{amb}}
\]  
The area \( A \) is calculated as:  
\[
A = \frac{\pi}{4} D^2 = \frac{\pi}{4} (0.1)^2 = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{(0.1 + 32) \, 9.81}{0.00785} + 1.10^5 = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{R_u}{M} = \frac{8314}{50} = 166.28
\]  

The gas mass \( m_{g,1} \) is determined using:  
\[
m_{g,1} = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
m_{g,1} = \frac{1.4 \cdot 10^5 \cdot 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3}}{166.28 \cdot 773} = 0.0034 \, \text{kg} = 3.4 \, \text{g}
\]

TASK 3b  
The enthalpy of the gas is equal to the enthalpy of the ice-water mixture:  
\[
h_{\text{gas}} = h_{\text{EW}}
\]
