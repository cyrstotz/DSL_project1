TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) in state 1 are determined using the following equations:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} \cdot V_{g,1}}{R \cdot T_{g,1}}, \quad R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g}
\]  
The balance equation for pressure is given as:  
\[
p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_K \cdot g}{A} + \frac{m_{\text{EW}} \cdot g}{A} = p_{g,1}
\]  
Where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder:  
\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2
\]

TASK 3b  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) in state 2 are determined as follows:  
The external pressure acting on the piston does not change, so:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) in the gas is equal to the temperature in the ice-water mixture (EW) at equilibrium:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  
Thus:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]

TASK 3c  
The transferred heat \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot u_2 - m_g \cdot u_1 = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot c_V \cdot (T_{2,\text{EW}} - T_{1,\text{EW}})
\]  
Where \( T_{2,\text{EW}} \) and \( T_{1,\text{EW}} \) are the final and initial temperatures of the ice-water mixture, respectively.

TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) in state 2 is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_g - u_f}
\]  
Where:  
\[
u_2 = \text{specific internal energy at state 2}, \quad u_f = \text{specific internal energy of liquid water}, \quad u_g = \text{specific internal energy of ice}
\]  
Values for \( u_f \) and \( u_g \) are taken from the solid-liquid equilibrium table at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \):  
\[
u_f = (0.0033 \, \text{kJ/kg}), \quad u_g = (0.0033 \, \text{kJ/kg})
\]
