TASK 4c  
The pressure at state 3 is given as \( p_3 = p_2 = 8 \, \text{bar} \). Using the data from Table A-10 at \( -16^\circ\text{C} \), the specific enthalpy at state 3 is calculated:  
\[
u_3 = u_f + x_1(u_g - u_f) = 93.92 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + 0.308 \cdot (208.45 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - 93.92 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}})
\]  
This results in \( x_1 = 0.308 \), where \( x_1 \) is the vapor quality at state 1.  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{K}}}{\dot{W}_{\text{K}}}
\]  
Here, \( \dot{Q}_{\text{K}} \) represents the heat removed, and \( \dot{W}_{\text{K}} \) is the work input to the compressor.
