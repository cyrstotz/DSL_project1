TASK 1a  
The energy balance equation for the reactor is written as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{in}} \cdot u_{\text{in}} - \dot{m}_{\text{out}} \cdot u_{\text{out}} + \dot{Q}_R + \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} = 0
\]  
The mass flow rate is constant, so \( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} = \dot{m}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} \). The heat flow removed by the coolant is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot \left( u_{\text{in}} - u_{\text{out}} \right) - \dot{Q}_R = \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}}
\]  

TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is calculated as:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{T_{\text{KF,in}} + T_{\text{KF,out}}}{2} = \frac{288.15 + 298.15}{2} = 293.15 \, \text{K}
\]  

TASK 1c  
The entropy production due to heat transfer is given by:  
\[
\Delta S = \dot{m}_{\text{a}} \cdot s_{\text{a}} - \dot{m}_{\text{e}} \cdot s_{\text{e}} + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T}
\]  

TASK 1d  
The mass of saturated liquid water added to the reactor is determined using the energy balance:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{12} \cdot h(70^\circ\text{C}) + Q_{R,12} - Q_{\text{aus}}
\]  
The crossed-out equation is ignored as per instructions.
