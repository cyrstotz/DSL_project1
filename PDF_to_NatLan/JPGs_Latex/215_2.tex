TASK 2a  
The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) diagram.  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), representing temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( S \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}] \), representing entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.  
- The process includes labeled isobars:  
  - \( P_2 = P_3 \)  
  - \( P_4 = P_5 = P_1 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - \( P_0 = P_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  

The diagram shows six states (1 through 6) connected by process lines:  
- State 1 to State 2 is vertical, indicating an adiabatic compression.  
- State 3 to State 4 is horizontal, indicating isobaric heat addition.  
- State 5 to State 6 is vertical, indicating adiabatic expansion.  
- \( S_1 = S_2 \) and \( S_5 = S_6 \) are marked, showing constant entropy during adiabatic processes.  

TASK 2b  
The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated under the assumption of a reversible and adiabatic nozzle.  

Energy balance for the nozzle:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} \right)
\]  
Entropy balance for the nozzle:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( s_e - s_a \right) \implies s_e = s_a
\]  

For an ideal polytropic state:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{P_6}{P_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

Using the energy equation:  
\[
\frac{w_5^2}{2} = \frac{w_6^2}{2} + (h_6 - h_5)
\]  
Rewriting:  
\[
w_6^2 = w_5^2 - 2(h_6 - h_5)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
h_6 - h_5 = c_p (T_6 - T_5) = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \cdot (328.07 \, \text{K} - 431.9 \, \text{K}) = -104.44 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
w_6^2 = 220^2 - 2 \cdot (-104.44 \cdot 1000 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}})
\]  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{50724} = 507.24 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\]  

Final results:  
\[
T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K}, \quad w_6 = 507.24 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\]
