TASK 4a  
The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(P\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process.  

- The vertical axis represents pressure (\(P\)) in millibar, ranging from 0 to 10.  
- The horizontal axis represents temperature (\(T\)) in degrees Celsius (\(^\circ\text{C}\)).  

Key features of the graph:  
1. **Triple Point**: A point labeled "Triple Point" is marked near the center of the graph, where the three phases (gas, ice, and water) coexist.  
2. **Phase Regions**:  
   - The region to the right of the triple point is labeled "Gas."  
   - The region below the triple point is labeled "Ice."  
   - The region to the left of the triple point is labeled "Water."  

3. **Processes**:  
   - An isothermal process is indicated by a horizontal line at constant temperature.  
   - An isobaric process is indicated by a vertical line at constant pressure.  

4. **States**:  
   - State 1 is marked on the horizontal axis in the "Water" region.  
   - State 2 is marked at the intersection of the isobaric and isothermal lines in the "Ice" region.  
   - State 3 is marked at the top of the isobaric line in the "Gas" region.  

The graph visually represents the transitions between states during the freeze-drying process, including sublimation and evaporation.
