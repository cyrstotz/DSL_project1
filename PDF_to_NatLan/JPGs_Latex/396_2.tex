TASK 2a  
The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The vertical axis is labeled as temperature \( T \) in Kelvin, and the horizontal axis is labeled as entropy \( s \) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kg·K} \). The diagram includes two isobaric lines: one at \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and another at \( 0.1916 \, \text{bar} \). The process starts at point \( 0 \), moves vertically upward along an isentropic path, and transitions to point \( 5 \) along an isobaric line.  

TASK 2b  
The following values and equations are provided:  
\[
w_{\text{air}} = 200 \, \text{m/s}
\]
\[
p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}
\]
\[
T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} = 270.15 \, \text{K}
\]
\[
s_0 = s_5
\]
\[
T_5 = 431.8 \, \text{K}, \, p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}, \, w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s}
\]
\[
p_6 = p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}
\]
The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the isentropic relation:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.8 \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{1.4-1}{1.4}} = 328.0747 \, \text{K}
\]

TASK 2c  
The equation for heat transfer \( Q \) is given as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right)
\]
The specific heat capacity relation is used:  
\[
c_p (T_5 - T_6) + \frac{w_5^2}{2} = \frac{w_6^2}{2}
\]
Rearranging for \( w_6 \):  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 c_p (T_5 - T_6) + w_5^2}
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot 1.006 \cdot (431.8 - 328.0747) + 220^2} = 507.244 \, \text{m/s}
\]

TASK 2d  
The entropy at state \( 0 \) is given as:  
\[
s_0 = s_5 = 270.26 \, \text{kJ}/\text{kg·K}
\]
