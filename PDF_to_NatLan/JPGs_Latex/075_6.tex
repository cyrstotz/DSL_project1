TASK 3c  
The temperature of the gas in state 2 is given as \( T_{g,2} = 0.0003^\circ\text{C} \).  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q + W = \Delta U + W
\]  

Given \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0.0003^\circ\text{C} \), the internal energy change is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) + W = Q
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta E = 0.633 \cdot (0.0003 - 500) = Q
\]  

An equation for velocity is partially written:  
\[
v_{2} = \frac{v_2}{m_2}
\]  
where \( m_2 = m_1 \).

TASK 3d  
The ice fraction in state 2 is calculated. The temperature \( T_{g,2} = 0.0003^\circ\text{C} \).  

The energy balance for the ice-water mixture (EW) is written as:  
\[
\Delta U = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = Q
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q = -1.5 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The internal energy \( u_1 \) is calculated using:  
\[
u_1 = x_1 \cdot u_f + x_1 \cdot (u_f - u_i)
\]  
At \( x_1 = 0.6 \):  
\[
u_1 = -133.394 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated using:  
\[
u_2 = u_f + x_2 \cdot (u_f - u_i)
\]  
The ice fraction \( x_2 \) is determined using:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_f - u_i}
\]  
At \( x_2 = 0.4351 \):  
\[
x_2 = 0.4351
\]  

Finally, \( u_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q}{m} + u_1
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{-1.5}{0.01} + (-133.394) = -188.394 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
