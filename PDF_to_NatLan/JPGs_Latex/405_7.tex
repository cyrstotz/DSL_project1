TASK 1a  
The page contains a sketch of a phase diagram with pressure (\( p \)) on the vertical axis and temperature (\( T \)) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes the following labeled regions:  

- **Flüssig** (Liquid): This region is to the left of the curve.  
- **Gasförmig** (Gaseous): This region is to the right of the curve.  
- **Nass-Dampf** (Wet Steam): This region is under the curve.  

The curve represents the phase boundary between liquid, wet steam, and gaseous states.  

Additional annotations:  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( T \) for temperature.  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( p \) for pressure.  
- Some text near the diagram is crossed out and ignored.  

No further mathematical expressions or textual explanations are visible.
