TASK 2a  
The diagram is a T-s diagram (temperature vs. entropy) illustrating the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine. The following features are labeled:  
- Isobars (constant pressure lines) are shown, with one labeled as \( p_0 \) and another as \( p_5 \).  
- The process includes labeled states: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The transitions between states are described as follows:  
  - Between states 1 and 2: Isentropic compression (adiabatic and reversible).  
  - Between states 2 and 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
  - Between states 3 and 4: Adiabatic and irreversible expansion.  
  - Between states 5 and 6: Mixing and nozzle expansion.  
- The diagram includes arrows indicating the direction of the processes, and the entropy axis is labeled as \( s \, [\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}] \).  

TASK 2b  
The equation for the outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is written as:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{w_5^2 + 2 \left( h_5 - h_6 \right)}
\]  
where:  
- \( w_5 \) is the velocity at state 5.  
- \( h_5 \) and \( h_6 \) are the specific enthalpies at states 5 and 6, respectively.  

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{dest}} = ex_{\text{flow},0} - ex_{\text{flow},6}
\]  
Expanding the terms:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{dest}} = \dot{m} \left[ h_6 - h_0 - T_0 \left( s_6 - s_0 \right) + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2} \right]
\]  
For an ideal gas:  
\[
h_6 - h_0 = c_p \left( T_6 - T_0 \right), \quad s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{dest}} = \dot{m} \left[ c_p \left( T_6 - T_0 \right) - T_0 \left( c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} \right) \right]
\]  
Given:  
- \( T_0 = 396 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( w_6 = 546.67 \, \text{m/s} \)  

Final result:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{dest}} = \text{value not fully legible, approximately } 26258672.5 \, \text{kJ}.
