TASK 2a  
The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis (in Kelvin), and the entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis (in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)). The process includes labeled states:  
- State 0 represents the ambient conditions.  
- States 1, 2, and 3 correspond to the compression process, with \( p_1 = p_3 \).  
- State 4 represents the combustion process.  
- State 5 corresponds to the mixing chamber, and \( p_4 = p_5 \).  
- State 6 represents the nozzle exit, where \( p_6 = p_0 \).  

The diagram shows isobars and process paths connecting the states, indicating compression, combustion, mixing, and expansion processes.

TASK 2b  
The first law of thermodynamics applied to the entire system is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_0 \left( h_0 + \frac{w_{\text{Luft}}^2}{2} \right) - h_6 - \frac{w_6^2}{2}
\]  
Rearranging this equation gives:  
\[
2 \left( h_0 - h_6 + \frac{w_{\text{Luft}}^2}{2} \right) = w_6^2
\]  

The enthalpy difference \( h_0 - h_6 \) is expressed as:  
\[
h_0 - h_6 = c_{p,\text{Luft}} \left( T_0 - T_6 \right)
\]  

The first law of thermodynamics applied to the mixing chamber is noted, but the equation is partially crossed out. The equation suggests:  
\[
T_5 = T_6
\]  

No further explanation or derivation is provided for the mixing chamber.
