TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{m_{\text{ice},2}}{m_{\text{EW}}} = \frac{u - u_f}{u_g - u_f}
\]  
Where:  
- \( m_{\text{ice},2} \) is the mass of ice in state 2.  
- \( m_{\text{EW}} \) is the total mass of the ice-water mixture.  
- \( u \) is the specific internal energy of the mixture.  
- \( u_f \) is the specific internal energy of saturated liquid.  
- \( u_g \) is the specific internal energy of saturated vapor.
