TASK 4e  
Eventually, a thermal equilibrium would be reached, and the interior space would assume the temperature of the condenser.

TASK 4c  
The temperature \( T_2 \) is given as \( -22^\circ\text{C} \).

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
\dot{m} (h_2 - h_1) + \dot{Q}_K = 0
\]

Since \( T_2 = T_1 \), it follows that \( h_2 = h_1 \).

The enthalpy \( h_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
h_1 = h_f(-22^\circ\text{C}) + x \cdot h_{fg}(-22^\circ\text{C})
\]

The vapor quality \( x \) is determined as:  
\[
x = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_{fg}} = \frac{93.92 - 21.77}{212.32} = 0.3374
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = 12.9135
\]

The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_K \) is given by:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \cdot (h_2 - h_1)
\]

The enthalpy \( h_2 \) is specified as:  
\[
h_2 = 234.086 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

Finally, the heat transfer rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = 0.1562 \, \text{kW}
\]
