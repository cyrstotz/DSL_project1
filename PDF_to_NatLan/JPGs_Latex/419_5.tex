TASK 1a  
The mean temperature \( \bar{T}_{g,2} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\bar{T}_{g,2} = 0.023^\circ \text{C}
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is considered.  

The differential energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( u \right) = \dot{m} \cdot \dot{u} + Q - W
\]  

The energy balance for the mass \( m \) is given as:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
m \cdot c_v \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = Q
\]  
\[
= 3.42 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 0.633 \cdot (-273.4741 - 273.15)
\]  
\[
= -2.2657 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
\[
= -2265.8 \, \text{J}
\]  

TASK 1d  
The specific heat ratio \( \kappa = 1.4 \).  

The vapor quality \( x_2 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_g - u_f}
\]  

The internal energy \( u_2 \) is determined as:  
\[
u_2 = u_f + x_2 \cdot (u_g - u_f)
\]  
\[
= 0.633 - 273.47 = -273.10
\]
