TASK 2c  
The mass-specific exergy destruction (\( ex_{\text{dest}} \)) is calculated using the following expression:  

\[
D_{ex,\text{STR}} = 97430 - 243.15 (337.73) + \frac{510^2}{2} - \frac{200^2}{2}
\]

Simplifying the equation:  

\[
D_{ex,\text{STR}} = 125469.5 \, \frac{J}{\text{kg}} = 125.47 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

TASK 2d  
The equation for exergy balance is given as:  

\[
0 = D_{ex,\text{STR}} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_j} \right) \dot{q}_j - \dot{u}_m - \dot{e}_{\text{REV}}
\]

The mass-specific exergy destruction (\( ex_{\text{dest}} \)) is equal to:  

\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = D_{ex,\text{STR}} = 125.47 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
