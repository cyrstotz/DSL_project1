TASK 1c  
The entropy production rate \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is calculated using the entropy balance equation:  
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = \sum \frac{\dot{Q}_i}{T_i} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
For the closed system, the entropy production rate is determined as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{62300 \, \text{W}}{293.15 \, \text{K}} = 2 \times 2.5 \, \frac{\text{W}}{\text{K}}
\]

TASK 1d  
The heat transfer \( \dot{Q} \) is zero.  
The energy balance equation for the system is:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i h_i + \dot{Q} + \dot{W}
\]  
Since \( \dot{Q} = 0 \), the equation simplifies to:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i h_i
\]  
For the cooling process from state 1 to state 2, the heat released is:  
\[
Q_{R,12} = Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \, \text{MJ}
\]  
The mass balance equation is:  
\[
m_{\text{total},2} - m_{\text{total},1} = \Delta m_{12}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12}
\]

TASK 1e  
The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1 = \sum \Delta m_i s_i + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
This equation accounts for the entropy contributions from mass flow, heat transfer, and entropy generation.
