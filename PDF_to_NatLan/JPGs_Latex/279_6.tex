TASK 2a  
The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The graph is labeled with states \( 0 \) through \( 6 \), showing the thermodynamic process steps.  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  
- The process includes isobaric and adiabatic transformations, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
- States \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \) are marked, with isobaric lines labeled accordingly.  

TASK 2b  
The following values are given:  
\[
w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s}, \quad p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}, \quad p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}, \quad T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}
\]  

The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{2.4 - 1}{2.4}}
\]  
\[
T_6 = 328.075 \, \text{K}
\]
