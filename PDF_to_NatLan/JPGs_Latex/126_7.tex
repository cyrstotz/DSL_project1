TASK 9a  
A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled as \( p \, \text{(bar)} \) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( v \, \text{(m}^3/\text{kg)} \). The graph appears to represent a pressure-volume relationship, but no specific curve or data points are plotted.

TASK 9b  
The text mentions the mass flow rate (\( \dot{m} \)) and references the first law of thermodynamics (\( 1. \, \text{HS} \)).

TASK 9c  
The text states "isenthalpic" and indicates that \( T \) (temperature) remains constant (\( T_{\text{const}} \)).
