TASK 2a  
The page contains a table and some calculations related to jet engine thermodynamics. Below is the transcription of the content:

### Table Description:
The table lists various states (labeled as "Zust√§nde") from 0 to 6, with corresponding values for pressure \( P \, [\text{bar}] \), temperature \( T \, [^\circ\text{C}] \), velocity \( w \, [\text{m/s}] \), and specific enthalpy \( h \, [\text{kJ/kg}] \).  

| Zustand | \( P \, [\text{bar}] \) | \( T \, [^\circ\text{C}] \) | \( w \, [\text{m/s}] \) | \( h \, [\text{kJ/kg}] \) |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 0       | 0.191                   | -30                        | 200                    |                          |
| 1       |                         |                            |                        |                          |
| 2       |                         |                            |                        |                          |
| 3       |                         |                            |                        |                          |
| 4       |                         |                            |                        |                          |
| 5       | 0.5                     | 431.9                      | 220                    |                          |
| 6       | 0.5                     |                            |                        |                          |

### Notes and Calculations:
1. \( w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot \left( h_5 - h_6 \right) + w_5^2} \)  
   This formula calculates the velocity \( w_6 \) at state 6 based on enthalpy differences and the velocity at state 5.  

2. \( h_6 = h_5 - 0.297 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
   The enthalpy at state 6 is determined by subtracting a specific value from the enthalpy at state 5.  

3. \( h_5 = 657.4 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
   The specific enthalpy at state 5 is given as \( 657.4 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

4. \( w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s} \)  
   The velocity at state 5 is explicitly stated as \( 220 \, \text{m/s} \).  

5. \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} \), \( P_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
   Ambient conditions are noted for state 0.  

### Additional Notes:
- The table and calculations appear to be part of a solution for determining the outlet velocity \( w_6 \) and other thermodynamic properties of the jet engine process.  
- The handwritten notes suggest the use of energy balance equations and specific enthalpy values to compute the desired quantities.
