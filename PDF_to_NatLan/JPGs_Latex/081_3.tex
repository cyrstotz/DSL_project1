TASK 1a  
The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(P\)-\(T\)) graph. It shows three distinct states labeled as \(1\), \(2\), and \(3\).  

- State \(1\) is at a lower pressure and temperature.  
- State \(2\) is at a higher temperature but similar pressure to \(1\).  
- State \(3\) is at a higher pressure and temperature compared to \(1\) and \(2\).  

The graph includes curved lines connecting the states, indicating transitions between them. The axes are labeled:  
- The vertical axis represents pressure (\(P\)).  
- The horizontal axis represents temperature (\(T\)).
