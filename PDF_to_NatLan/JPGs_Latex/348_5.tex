TASK 3a  
Water and ice are considered incompressible, meaning the volume of the ice-water mixture (EW) remains constant.  

The energy balance for the ice-water mixture is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q
\]  
where \( Q \) is the heat transferred.  

The temperature of the ice-water mixture (\( T_{\text{EW}} \)) is \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) and remains constant.  

The initial ice mass fraction is given as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.6
\]  
The water mass fraction is therefore:  
\[
x_{\text{water},1} = 1 - x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.4
\]  

TASK 3c  
The specific internal energy of the ice-water mixture in state 1 (\( u_1 \)) is calculated as:  
\[
u_1 = u_{\text{ice}}(T_{\text{EW},1}) \cdot x_{\text{ice},1} + u_{\text{water}}(T_{\text{EW},1}) \cdot x_{\text{water},1}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_1 = -200 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The specific internal energy in state 2 (\( u_2 \)) is determined using the heat transfer \( Q \):  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot u_1}{m_{\text{EW}}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = -185 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

TASK 3d  
The final ice mass fraction (\( x_{\text{ice},2} \)) is calculated using the equilibrium table:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{u_2 - u_{\text{water}}(T_2)}{u_{\text{ice}}(T_2) - u_{\text{water}}(T_2)}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.4848
\]  

TASK 3e  
The remaining water mass fraction is:  
\[
x_{\text{water},2} = 1 - x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.5152
\]
