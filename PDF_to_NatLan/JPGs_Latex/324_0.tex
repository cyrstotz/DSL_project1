TASK 4a  
The graph is a qualitative representation of the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents pressure (\( p \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents temperature (\( T \)).  
No specific values or phase regions are marked on the graph.

TASK 4c  
The equation for the enthalpy \( h_f(31.33) \) is given as:  
\[
h_f(31.33) = 91.45 + x \cdot \frac{1.33}{m^2}
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance (\( \epsilon_K \)) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{Q_{zu}}{W_{zu}}
\]

The energy balance for a stationary system is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_1 - h_2) + Q_{zu}
\]

Rearranging for \( Q_{zu} \):  
\[
Q_{zu} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1)
\]  
(Note: Part of the equation is crossed out and ignored in the transcription.)
