TASK 3c  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = 2 Q_{12}
\]  
where \( E \) represents energy, and \( Q_{12} \) is the heat transferred.  
Additionally, \( E \) is expressed as \( E = U + W \), indicating internal energy and work.  

TASK 3d  
The energy balance for the ice-water mixture (EW) is given as:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) + Q_{12} = 0
\]  
This assumes no work is done (\( V = \text{const} \)) and considers the compression of the system.  

The following relationships are defined:  
\[
u_2 = x_2 \cdot u_{\text{rest}} + x_2 \cdot u_{\text{rest}}
\]  
\[
u_1 = u_{\text{rest}} - x_1 \cdot (u_{\text{fusion}} - u_{\text{rest}})
\]  

The expression for \( u_{\text{rest}} \) is expanded as:  
\[
u_{\text{rest}} = u_{\text{rest}}(1 \, \text{bar}) + \frac{1.9 - 1.1 \, \text{bar}}{2 - 1.1 \, \text{bar}} \cdot (u_{\text{rest}}(2 \, \text{bar}) - u_{\text{rest}}(1 \, \text{bar}))
\]
