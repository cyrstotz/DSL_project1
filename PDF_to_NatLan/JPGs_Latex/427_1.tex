TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled as \( T \, [K] \) (temperature in Kelvin) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( S \, [kJ/(kg \cdot K)] \) (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin). The graph appears to represent a qualitative \( T \)-\( S \) diagram, but no specific curves or points are plotted.

TASK 2b  
The exergy balance equation is partially written as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{ex,st}} = \dot{m} \left[ h \right]
\]  
The equation is incomplete, and no further terms or explanations are provided.
