TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn representing the thermodynamic process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is \( s \) (specific entropy in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)).  

The graph includes the following features:  
- Points labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4,5 \), and \( 6 \) represent different states in the process.  
- Two dashed curves are drawn, representing isobars: \( p = p_L \) (lower pressure) and \( p = p_A \) (higher pressure).  
- The process transitions between these states, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  

TASK 2b  
A table is provided with columns labeled \( T \, [K] \), \( p \, [\text{bar}] \), and \( w \, [\text{m/s}] \). The following values are filled in:  
- For state \( 5 \): \( T = 431.9 \, \text{K} \), \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( w = 220 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- Other rows for states \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), and \( 6 \) are left blank.  

Below the table, calculations for state \( 6 \) are shown:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}  
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \cdot \left( \frac{0.191 \, \text{bar}}{0.5 \, \text{bar}} \right)^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}}  
\]
\[
T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K}  
\]

An energy balance equation is written:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_5 - h_6 - T_6 (s_5 - s_6) + \text{ke} \right) + \sum_j \left( 1 - \frac{T_j}{T_5} \right) \dot{Q}_j - \dot{W}_t - \dot{E}_{\text{exit}}  
\]
