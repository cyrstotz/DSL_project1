TASK 1a  
The entropy balance is expressed as:  
\[
0 = \sum_i \frac{\dot{Q}_i}{T_s} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
A diagram is included showing a rectangular system with labeled heat flows \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) and \( \dot{Q}_{\text{in}} \), as well as temperatures \( T_{\text{KF,in}} \), \( T_{\text{KF,out}} \), and \( T_{\text{Reactor}} \). The arrows indicate the direction of heat transfer.

TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature \( \bar{T}_{\text{KF}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\bar{T}_{\text{KF}} = \frac{T_{\text{KF,in}} + T_{\text{KF,out}}}{2} = 293.15 \, \text{K}
\]

TASK 1c  
The entropy balance for the system, assuming steady-state operation and neglecting mass accumulation, is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{in}}(s_{\text{in}} - s_{\text{out}}) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{\bar{T}_{\text{KF}}} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  

The equation is simplified to show the relationship between mass flow rate, entropy change, and heat transfer.
