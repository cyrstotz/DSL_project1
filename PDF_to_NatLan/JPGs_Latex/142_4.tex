TASK 3a  
The initial temperature of the gas is given as \( T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} \). The initial volume of the gas is \( V_{g,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L} \). The specific heat capacity at constant volume is \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \), and the molar mass of the gas is \( M_g = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol} \).  

The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_K \cdot g}{\pi \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^2}
\]  
where \( p_{\text{amb}} \) is the ambient pressure, \( m_K \) is the mass of the piston, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( D \) is the diameter of the cylinder.  

The mass of the gas \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p \cdot V}{R \cdot T}
\]  
Substituting the values, the calculation gives \( m_g = 3.619 \, \text{g} \).

TASK 3c  
The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using:  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
where \( T_2 \) is the final temperature, \( T_1 \) is the initial temperature, \( m \) is the mass of the gas, and \( c_V \) is the specific heat capacity.  

The internal energy at state 2, \( u_2 \), is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q_{12}}{m} + u_1
\]  
Substituting the values, \( u_2 = 239.634 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).

TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is determined using the equation:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_f - u_{fl}}
\]  
where \( u_f \) is the specific internal energy of the saturated liquid, and \( u_{fl} \) is the specific internal energy of the saturated solid. Substituting the values, \( x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.713 \).  

The internal energy at state 1, \( u_1 \), is calculated as:  
\[
u_1 = u_{fl} + x_{\text{ice},1} \cdot (u_f - u_{fl})
\]  
Substituting the values, \( u_1 = -200.0928 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).
