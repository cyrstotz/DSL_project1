TASK 2a  
The diagram is a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) graph with labeled points corresponding to states in a thermodynamic process. The vertical axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin, and the horizontal axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \). The graph shows a sequence of states labeled \( 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \), connected by lines indicating transitions between these states.  

TASK 2b  
The relationship between \( T_6 \) and \( T_5 \) is given by:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
\[
T_6 = 937.9 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.757 \, \text{bar}}{0.5 \, \text{bar}} \right)^{\frac{2.4-1}{2.4}}
\]  
\[
T_6 = 327.4 \, \text{K}
\]  
The final result is underlined: \( T_6 = 327.4 \, \text{K} \).
