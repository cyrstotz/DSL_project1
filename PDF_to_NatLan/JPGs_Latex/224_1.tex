TASK 3e  
The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = (m_{\text{gas}} + \Delta m_{12}) S_2 - m_{\text{gas}} S_1 = 1237.8488 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]  
where \( S_2 \) is determined using the function \( f \) at \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \):  
\[
S_2 = f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 0.95649 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
The entropy \( S_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
S_1 = S_f + x (S_g - S_f) = 1.235744 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]

TASK 3d  
The mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) of saturated liquid water added to the reactor is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
m_{\text{gas}} (u_1 - u_2) - \Delta m_{12} u_2 = \Delta m_{12} h_{\text{e,in}}
\]  
Rearranging for \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_{\text{gas}} (u_1 - u_2)}{h_{\text{e,in}} + u_2} = 6.408 \, T
\]
