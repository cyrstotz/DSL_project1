TASK 3b  
Since the state is still within the wet steam region, the temperature and pressure remain constant.  
\[
T_2 = 0^\circ\text{C}, \quad p_2 = 1.40 \, \text{bar}
\]

TASK 3c  
The specific heat capacity of the gas is calculated as:  
\[
c_{p,\text{gas}} = \frac{R}{M} + c_V = 799.28 \, \text{J/kgÂ·K}
\]

The heat transfer is determined using the enthalpy difference:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g (h_{2g} - h_{1g})
\]

Alternatively, using the temperature difference:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_{p,\text{gas}} (T_2 - T_1)
\]

Given:  
\[
T_2 - T_1 = 500 \, \text{K}
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_{p,\text{gas}} (T_2 - T_1) = 1366.77 \, \text{J}
\]

Description of Figure:  
The figure includes a sketch with arrows indicating heat flow (\( Q \)) and a temperature difference (\( \Delta T \)). It visually represents the relationship between the enthalpy change and heat transfer.
