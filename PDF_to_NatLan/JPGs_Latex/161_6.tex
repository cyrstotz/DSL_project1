TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{U_2 - U_f(0^\circ\text{C})}{U_g(0^\circ\text{C}) - U_f(0^\circ\text{C})} \quad \text{at } 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]

The energy balance for the system is expressed as:  
\[
U_2 = U_1 + \Delta U_{12}
\]

The internal energy \( U_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
U_1 = U_f(0^\circ\text{C}, 1.4 \, \text{bar}) + x_{\text{ice},1} \left( U_g(0^\circ\text{C}, 1.4 \, \text{bar}) - U_f(0^\circ\text{C}, 1.4 \, \text{bar}) \right)
\]

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U_{12} \) is given by:  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = Q_{12}
\]

Substituting these into the formula for \( x_{\text{ice},2} \):  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{U_1 + Q_{12} - U_f(0^\circ\text{C})}{U_g(0^\circ\text{C}) - U_f(0^\circ\text{C})}
\]
