TASK 2a  
The task involves drawing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. Two diagrams are sketched:  
- The first diagram shows a series of curves representing the thermodynamic process, with labeled axes \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (entropy). The curves include isobars and transitions between states.  
- The second diagram includes arrows indicating directions of processes and transitions between states, with intersecting lines representing different thermodynamic paths.  

TASK 2b  
The problem involves calculating the outlet temperature \( T_6 \) and velocity \( w_6 \).  

Given:  
\[
w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s}, \quad p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}, \quad T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}, \quad p_6 = p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Adiabatic process:  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa}}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \left( \frac{0.191 \times 10^5}{0.5 \times 10^5} \right)^{\frac{1.4-1}{1.4}} = 328.07 \, \text{K} \quad \text{or} \quad 328.1 \, \text{K}
\]  

Velocity calculation:  
\[
w_0^2 = w_c^2 - w_5^2
\]  

Steady flow process:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \left[ h_c - h_a + \frac{w_c^2 - w_a^2}{2} \right] \quad \Rightarrow \quad h_c - h_a = c_p \int_{T_a}^{T_c} dT = c_p (T_c - T_a)
\]  

Substituting:  
\[
c_p (328.1 - 431.9) = -104.1728 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

\[
w_0^2 = w_c^2 - w_5^2 = 760.444 - 220^2
\]  

\[
w_0 = \sqrt{760.444} = 400.55 \, \text{m/s}
\]  

TASK 2c  
The task involves calculating the mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \).  

Exergy balance:  
\[
ex_{\text{str}} = \left[ h - h_0 - T_0 (s - s_0) \right] + \frac{w^2}{2}
\]  

Mass-specific exergy destruction:  
\[
ex_{\text{str}} = \int_{T_0}^{T} c_p (T) dT - T_0 \int_{T_0}^{T} c_p \frac{dT}{T} - R \ln \left( \frac{p}{p_0} \right) + \frac{w^2}{2}
\]  

Some terms are crossed out, but the general form of the exergy destruction equation is visible.  

No further numerical results are provided for this subtask.
