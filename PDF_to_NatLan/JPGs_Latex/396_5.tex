TASK 4a  
The task begins with labeled states and thermodynamic properties for the freeze-drying process using R134a.  

State 1:  
\[
T_1 = \text{unknown}, \quad p_1 = \text{unknown}, \quad h_1 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

State 2:  
\[
T_2 = \text{unknown}, \quad p_2 = p_1, \quad x_2 = 1
\]  

State 3:  
\[
T_3 = \text{unknown}, \quad p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]  

State 4:  
\[
T_4 = 31.33^\circ \text{C}, \quad p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar}, \quad x_4 = 0, \quad h_4 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The equation for the work done by the compressor is given as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) = \dot{W}_K
\]

TASK 4c  
Using the given conditions:  
\[
T_2 = -22^\circ \text{C}, \quad p_2 = p_1 = 1.2132 \, \text{bar} \, \text{(from Table A-10)}
\]  

The vapor quality at state 1 is calculated using:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = 0.3347
\]
