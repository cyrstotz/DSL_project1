The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = S_2 - S_1
\]  

Breaking this into components:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = S_2 - S_1 = S_2 - S_{1,m_1} - S_{1,m_2}
\]  

Where:  
- \( S_2 \) is the entropy at state 2.  
- \( S_{1,m_1} \) is the entropy contribution of the reactor mass at state 1.  
- \( S_{1,m_2} \) is the entropy contribution of the added mass at state 1.  

The entropy at state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
S_2 = S_2(5755 \, \text{kg} + 3 \, \text{kg})
\]  

The entropy at state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
S_1 = S_1(5755 \, \text{kg})
\]  

For the added mass, the entropy contribution is:  
\[
S_{1,m_2} = S(20^\circ\text{C}, 1 \, \text{bar}) = 0.464 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  

For the reactor contents at state 1:  
\[
S_{1,m_1} = S(100^\circ\text{C}, 0.005 \, \text{kg}) = 2.806 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \cdot 0.005 \cdot \left(7.354 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} - 7.306 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}\right) = 2.394 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  

Finally, the total entropy change is:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = 7227.74 \, \text{kJ}
\]
