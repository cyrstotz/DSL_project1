TASK 1c  
A diagram is drawn showing heat transfer through a wall labeled "Wand." The heat flow \( \dot{Q} \) is given as \( 65 \, \text{kW} \), with temperatures \( T_{\text{KF}} = 285 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_R = 373.15 \, \text{K} \). The entropy balance around the wall is expressed as:  
\[
0 + \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{373.15 \, \text{K}} - \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{285 \, \text{K}} + \dot{S}_{\text{erz}} = 0
\]  
The entropy generation rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{erz}} = 0.04675 \, \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}} = 416.15 \, \frac{\text{W}}{\text{K}}
\]  

TASK 1d  
The mass flow rate of the reactor contents is zero (\( \dot{m}_R = 0 \)). The reactor temperature changes from \( T_R = 100^\circ\text{C} \) to \( T_R2 = 70^\circ\text{C} \). The inlet temperature is \( T_{\text{in}} = 20^\circ\text{C} \), and the heat released during cooling is \( Q_{\text{aus}} = 35 \, \text{MJ} \).  

Since the system is in state \( i \), the enthalpy \( h \neq h_F \), and the specific volume \( U = U_F \).  

Energy balance for the semi-open system is given as:  
\[
\Delta U = \Delta m_{\text{ein}} \cdot h_{\text{ein}} + Q_j
\]  
Rewriting the equation:  
\[
m_2 \cdot U_2 - m_1 \cdot U_1 = \Delta m_{\text{ein}} \cdot h_{\text{ein}} - Q_{\text{aus}}
\]  
The mass at state 2 is expressed as:  
\[
m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{\text{ein}}
\]  

Given values:  
\[
m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg}
\]  
\[
U_1 = 2506.5 \cdot 0.005 + (1 - 0.005) \cdot 4178.94 = 4129.38
\]  
\[
U_2 = U(70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.95
\]  
\[
h_{\text{ein}} = h(20^\circ\text{C}) = 83.96
\]
