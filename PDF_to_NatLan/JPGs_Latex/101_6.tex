TASK 3c  
The equation shown represents an energy balance or exergy equation:  

\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \left( h_1 - h_0 - T_0 (s_1 - s_0) \right) = 0
\]  

Here, \( \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \) is the total mass flow rate, \( h_1 \) and \( h_0 \) are specific enthalpies at states 1 and 0, \( T_0 \) is the reference temperature, and \( s_1 \) and \( s_0 \) are specific entropies at states 1 and 0.
