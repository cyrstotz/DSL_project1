TASK 1d  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
m_1 u_2 + m_e (u_2 - h_e) - m_1 u_1 = Q
\]  
Rearranging to solve for \( m_e \):  
\[
m_e = \frac{Q + m_1 (u_1 - u_2)}{u_2 - h_e}
\]  

Given data:  
\[
Q = -35 \, \text{MJ}, \quad m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg}
\]  
Temperatures:  
\[
T_1 = 100^\circ\text{C}, \quad T_2 = 70^\circ\text{C}, \quad T_e = 20^\circ\text{C}
\]  
Steam quality:  
\[
x = 0.005
\]  

From the water tables (referenced as "TAB32"):  
\[
u_1 (100^\circ\text{C}, \, \text{saturated liquid}) = 427.38 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
\[
u_2 (70^\circ\text{C}, \, \text{saturated liquid}) = 419.44 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
\[
u_e (20^\circ\text{C}, \, \text{saturated liquid}) = 205.05 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
\[
h_e (20^\circ\text{C}, \, \text{saturated liquid}) = 205.05 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

TASK 1e  
The entropy change is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta S = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1 - \Delta m_{12} s_e = \frac{Q}{T} + S_{\text{res}}
\]  

Where:  
- \( \Delta m_{12} \) represents the mass added during cooling.  
- \( s_1, s_2, s_e \) are specific entropies at respective states.  
- \( Q \) is the heat released during cooling.  
- \( T \) is the temperature at which heat transfer occurs.  
- \( S_{\text{res}} \) accounts for residual entropy generation.
