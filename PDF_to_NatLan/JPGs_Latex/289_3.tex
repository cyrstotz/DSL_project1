TASK 2a  
The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(S\)) diagram. The graph includes labeled isobars and isentropic processes. Key points are marked as states \(0\), \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(5\), and \(6\). The isobaric and isentropic processes are clearly indicated, with arrows showing the direction of the process. The axes are labeled as \(T \, [^\circ\text{C}]\) for temperature and \(S \, [\text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K}]\) for entropy.  

TASK 2b  
The equations and calculations for determining the outlet temperature \(T_6\) and velocity \(w_6\) are as follows:  

1. The entropy at state \(5\) is equal to the entropy at state \(6\):  
   \[
   S_5 = S_6
   \]

2. The temperature at state \(6\) is calculated using the isentropic relation:  
   \[
   T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
   \]
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
   \]
   With \(T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}\), \(p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}\), \(p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}\), and \(\kappa = 1.4\):  
   \[
   T_6 = 431.9 \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} = 328.0796697 \, \text{K}
   \]

3. The outlet velocity \(w_6\) is calculated using the energy balance:  
   \[
   w_6 = \sqrt{2 c_p (T_5 - T_6) + w_5^2}
   \]
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot 1.006 \cdot (431.9 - 328.0796697) + 220^2}
   \]
   Result:  
   \[
   w_6 = 507.284 \, \text{m/s}
   \]
