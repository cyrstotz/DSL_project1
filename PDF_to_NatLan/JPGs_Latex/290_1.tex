TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) in state 1 are calculated as follows:  

The perfect gas properties are given:  
\[
M_g = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol}, \quad c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}, \quad V_{g,1} = 0.00514 \, \text{m}^3
\]  
The cylinder diameter is \( D = 0.1 \, \text{m} \), and the area is calculated as:  
\[
A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  
The volume is:  
\[
V = D \cdot A = 0.00514 \, \text{m}^3
\]  
The gas pressure is determined using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{m_g R T_{g,1}}{V_{g,1}}
\]  
where \( R = \frac{8.314}{M_g} = 166.28 \, \text{J/kg·K} \).  

The force exerted by the piston is:  
\[
F = m_K \cdot g = 32.1 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 315 \, \text{N}
\]  
The pressure due to the piston is:  
\[
p = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{315}{0.00785} = 1.1 \, \text{bar}
\]  
Thus, \( p_{g,1} = 1 \, \text{bar} + 1.1 \, \text{bar} = 2.1 \, \text{bar} \).  

The gas mass is calculated as:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} = \frac{2.1 \cdot 0.00514}{166.28 \cdot 500} = 0.002687 \, \text{kg}
\]

TASK 3b  
The conditions for \( T_{g,2} \), \( p_{g,2} \), and \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \) are discussed.  

The explanation states that volumes 1 and 2 are constant, and the gas does not expand. The temperature remains constant, \( T_2 = T_1 \), because the volume does not change. The pressure remains constant as \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \), since the system is closed and no external work is done.  

---

TASK 3c  
The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = \Delta U_{g,12} = -\Delta U_{\text{EW},12}
\]  
The change in internal energy of the gas is:  
\[
\Delta U_{g,12} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = 0.633 \cdot (500 - 0.002) = 316.58 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
Thus, the heat transferred is:  
\[
Q_{12} = -0.85 \, \text{kJ}
\]
