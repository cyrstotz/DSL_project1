**Visible Content:**  
- The title "Aufgabe 4" indicates Task 4.  
- Subtask "a)" specifies the drawing of the \(p\)-\(T\) diagram for the refrigerant.  
- The text "Schritt 1 von KÃ¼hlmittel" translates to "Step 1 of the refrigerant."  

**Diagram Description:**  
- A graph is partially drawn with axes labeled:  
  - The vertical axis is labeled \(p\) (pressure).  
  - The horizontal axis is labeled \(T\) (temperature).  
- No additional curves, points, or annotations are visible on the graph.
