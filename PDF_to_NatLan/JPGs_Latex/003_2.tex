TASK 2a  
The page contains a T-s diagram illustrating the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine. The diagram is labeled with states \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\). The processes are described as follows:  
- Between states \(1\) and \(2\), the process is labeled "reversible adiabatic."  
- Between states \(2\) and \(3\), the process is labeled "isobaric."  
- Between states \(5\) and \(6\), the pressure is noted as \(p_6 = p_0\).  

The x-axis is labeled as entropy (\(s\)), and the y-axis is labeled as temperature (\(T\)). The diagram includes curves and lines representing the thermodynamic paths, with annotations indicating the nature of each process.  

TASK 2b  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = \sum \dot{m}_i \left( h_i(t) + \frac{w_i^2}{2} + \rho e_i(t) \right) + \sum \dot{Q}_i(t) - \sum \dot{W}_\text{in}(t)
\]  

Further simplifications and substitutions are shown:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_\text{ges} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right] - \int_1^n \rho \, dV
\]  

The enthalpy difference \(h_5 - h_6\) is expressed as:  
\[
h_5 - h_6 = \int_{T_6}^{T_5} c_p(T) \, dT = c_p \cdot (T_5 - T_6)
\]  

The term \(\dot{m}_\text{ges}\) is written separately at the bottom of the page, possibly indicating the total mass flow rate.  

No additional diagrams or annotations are present beyond the T-s diagram and equations.
