TASK 1a  
The mass flow rate is given as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{in}} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s}
\]

The heat flow equation is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_j = \dot{m}(h_a - h_e) = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_1)
\]

The enthalpy at the inlet (\( h_a \)) is calculated based on the following conditions:  
- Temperature \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Steam quality \( x = 1 \)  
From Table A2, the enthalpy value is:  
\[
h_1 = 2626.8 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The enthalpy at the outlet (\( h_2 \)) is determined under the following conditions:  
- Temperature \( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \)  
From Table A2, the enthalpy value is:  
\[
h_2 = 2676.1 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The heat flow is calculated using the corrected equation:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_1)
\]  
The result is:  
\[
Q = 14.79 \, \text{kW}
\]
