TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The curve represents a typical phase diagram, showing a peak and then a decline, which is characteristic of the pressure-temperature relationship in a refrigeration cycle.

TASK 4b  
From Table A-11:  
\[
h_f = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
The enthalpy at state 2 is equal to the enthalpy at state 4:  
\[
h_2 = h_4
\]  
This is valid because the process involves isenthalpic throttling.  

Additional notes:  
\[
p_1 = p_2, \quad p_2 = p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar}, \quad s_2 = s_4
\]
