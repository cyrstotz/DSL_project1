TASK 3a  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
Q_{12} = U_{2} - U_{1}
\]  
where \( U_1 \) represents the internal energy at state 1.

TASK 3b  
The pressure of the gas is given by:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{EW}}
\]  
The ideal gas law is applied:  
\[
p V = m R T
\]  
At equilibrium, the relationship between the internal energies is expressed as:  
\[
U_{\text{EW}} - U_{\text{g}} = C
\]  
The specific heat at constant volume is noted as:  
\[
c_V = 0.633 \, \frac{1}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  
The specific heat at constant pressure (\( c_p \)) is left undefined.

TASK 3d  
The ice mass fraction is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_{\text{ice}} = \frac{U_{\text{ice}} - U_{\text{liquid}}}{U_{\text{freeze}} - U_{\text{liquid}}}
\]
