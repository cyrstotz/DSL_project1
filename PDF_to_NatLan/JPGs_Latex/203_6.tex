TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) (in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in \( ^\circ \text{C} \)) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows three distinct regions labeled "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). The curve separating the solid and liquid regions is marked with a point labeled "1," while the curve separating the liquid and gas regions is marked with a point labeled "2." The intersection of all three regions is labeled "Tripel" (triple point).  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_W \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_W = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{ab}}}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{ab}}}{\dot{Q}_{\text{ab}} - \dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}
\]  

TASK 4e  
The text states:  
"Die Temperatur würde weiter sinken."  
Translation: "The temperature would continue to decrease."
