TASK 2a  
The diagram provided is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. It includes labeled isobars and key states:  
- State 0: \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} \).  
- State 1: \( p_1 = p_2 \).  
- State 2: \( p_2 = p_3 \).  
- State 3: \( p_3 = p_4 \).  
- State 4: \( p_4 = p_5 \).  
- State 5: \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  
- State 6: \( p_6 = p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K} \).  

The diagram shows the progression of the process from state 0 to state 6, with arrows indicating the direction of entropy change. The isobars are curved lines, and the temperature increases along the process path.  

TASK 2b  
The transition from state 5 to state 6 is described as isentropic. The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

An energy balance equation is provided:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_6 - h_5) + \dot{m} \frac{w_6^2 - w_5^2}{2} + Q^{\prime\prime} - W^{\prime\prime}
\]  
Rearranging terms:  
\[
2 (h_6 - h_5) = w_5^2 - w_6^2 \quad \rightarrow \quad w_6^2 - w_5^2 = 2 (h_6 - h_5)
\]  

This equation relates the enthalpy difference between states 5 and 6 to the velocity difference.
