TASK 3a  
The mass of the gas \( m_g \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
m_g = \frac{V_g \cdot p_g}{R \cdot T_g} = \frac{3.14 \cdot 5}{0.166 \cdot 500} = 3.43 \, \text{g}
\]  
This is converted to kilograms:  
\[
m_g = 3.43 \, \text{g} = 3.43 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg}
\]  

The volume of the gas is given as:  
\[
V_g = 3.14 \, \text{L} = 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3
\]  

The temperature of the gas is:  
\[
T_g = 500^\circ\text{C} = 773.15 \, \text{K}
\]

TASK 3b  
The pressure of the gas in state 2 is calculated using the formula:  
\[
p_g^{(2)} = p_g^{(1)} \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]  

The energy of the gas is equal to the energy of the ice-water mixture:  
\[
E_g = E_{\text{EW}}
\]

TASK 3c  
The change in energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta u
\]  

No further calculations or explanations are provided for \( \Delta E \).
