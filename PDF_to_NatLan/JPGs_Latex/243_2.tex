The exergy output is expressed as the sum of the exergy due to heat transfer and the exergy due to work:
\[
\dot{e}_{\text{out}} = \dot{e}_{\text{Q}} + \dot{e}_{\text{W}}
\]

The exergy due to heat transfer is calculated using the formula:
\[
\dot{e}_{\text{Q}} = \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) \dot{Q}
\]

The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is determined as follows:
\[
\dot{m} = \text{First law}
\]

The equation for the mass flow rate is:
\[
\dot{m} = h_{\text{out}} - h_{\text{in}} = h_{\text{out}} - 5.925 \, \text{time}
\]

Substituting into the equation:
\[
\dot{m} \cdot (1 + 5.925) = h_{\text{out}}
\]

Finally, the mass flow rate is expressed as:
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{h_{\text{out}}}{6.925}
\]
