TASK 2a  
The table lists pressure (\( p \)) and temperature (\( T \)) values for various states in the jet engine process. Some entries are crossed out and ignored.  

State 0:  
- \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( T = -30^\circ\text{C} \)  

State 1:  
- \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  

State 2:  
- \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  

State 3:  
- Entry is crossed out.  

State 5:  
- \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( T = 431.9 \, \text{K} \)  

State 6:  
- \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  

Additional note:  
The text at the bottom reads:  
"Given: \( T_s \), \( p_s \), \( w_5 \)."
