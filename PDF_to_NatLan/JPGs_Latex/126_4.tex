TASK 2d  
The equation for exergy destruction and velocity exergy is written as follows:

\[
0 = -\Delta ex_{\text{str}} + \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T}\right) \cdot \dot{q} - \dot{w}_c - ex_{\text{vel}}
\]

Simplified, the velocity exergy is expressed as:

\[
ex_{\text{vel}} = -\Delta ex_{\text{str}} + \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T}\right) \cdot \dot{q} - \dot{w}_c
\]
