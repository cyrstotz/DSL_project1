TASK 3b  
To determine \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \), the following calculations are performed:  

The energy balance for the system is expressed as:  
\[
0 = m_g h_5 + m_6 \left( w_6^2 - w_5^2 \right) / 2
\]  

The entropy balance under steady-state conditions is considered.  

The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 + \frac{c_p}{T_5} \left( T_5 - T_6 \right)
\]  
where \( T_5 = 328.0 \, \text{K} \).  

The enthalpy \( h_5 \) is determined as:  
\[
h_5 = -104.453 \, \text{J}
\]  

The velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated using the energy equation:  
\[
w_6^2 = w_5^2 + \frac{2}{m} \left( h_5 - h_6 \right)
\]  

The mass \( m_6 \) is determined as:  
\[
m_6 = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 + \frac{w_6^2}{w_5^2} \right)
\]  

Finally, the pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is calculated using the ideal gas law and the given conditions.
