TASK 3c  
The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system is applied:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W_{v,\text{rev}}
\]  
The reversible work is expressed as:  
\[
W_{v,\text{rev}} = \int_{1}^{2} p \, dv
\]  
The heat transfer is given by:  
\[
m_g c_v (T_2 - T_1) = Q_{12}
\]

TASK 3d  
The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system is applied again:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W_{v,\text{rev}}
\]  
Since the system is incompressible, \( W_{v,\text{rev}} = 0 \).  

The heat transfer is calculated as:  
\[
m_{12} (u_2 - u_1) = 1500 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The specific internal energy \( u_1 \) at \( p = 1 \, \text{bar} \) and \( x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.6 \) is calculated using:  
\[
u_1 = u_f + x (u_g - u_f)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_1 = 0.033 + 0.6 \times (-333.992 - 0.033) = -200 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The specific internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{1500}{m_{12}} + u_1 = -185.0789 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

At \( p = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \), the ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is determined using:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_g - u_f}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.555
\]
