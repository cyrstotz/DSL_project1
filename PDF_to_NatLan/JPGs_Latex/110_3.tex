TASK 2c  
The thermodynamic mean temperature \( \bar{T} \) is calculated using the integral:  
\[
\bar{T} = \frac{\int_{s_3}^{s_2} T \, ds}{s_2 - s_3}
\]  

The equation simplifies to:  
\[
\bar{T} = \int_{s_3}^{s_2} T \, ds = T_2 - T_3
\]  

An attempt is made to use the ideal logarithmic relationship:  
\[
\ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_3}\right) \, \text{(small? unclear)}
\]  

Further calculations involve:  
\[
\frac{1195 \, \text{J}}{1.006 \, \text{J}} = 94
\]  
\[
\frac{288 \, \text{K}}{-T_3} = -800 \, \text{(unclear)} \, 6.293 \, \text{(unclear)}
\]  

The phrase "can't be s2" is noted, possibly indicating an error or uncertainty in the calculation.
