TASK 2c  
The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is expressed as:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = h - h_0 - T_0(s - s_0) + ke
\]  
The change in flow exergy between states 5 and 6 is given by:  
\[
\Delta ex_{56} = h_6 - h_5
\]  

TASK 2d  
The exergy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \Delta ex_{\text{str}} + \sum \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W} - \dot{E}_{\text{ex,red}}
\]  
This equation accounts for the change in exergy storage, heat transfer, work transfer, and the reduction in exergy.
