TASK 2a  
The table contains thermodynamic properties for various states (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 0) of a jet engine system. The columns are labeled as follows:  

- \( T \): Temperature  
- \( p \): Pressure  
- \( h \): Specific enthalpy  
- \( s \): Specific entropy  
- \( w \): Velocity  

The values provided in the table are:  
- At state 5:  
  \( T = 931.8 \, \text{K} \), \( p = 5.10^5 \, \text{Pa} \), \( w = 220 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \)  
- At state 6:  
  \( T = 318.075 \, \text{K} \), \( p = 1.01 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \), \( w = 507.24 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \)  
- At state 0:  
  \( T = 293.15 \, \text{K} \), \( p = 1.01 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \), \( w = 200 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \)  

No values are filled in for states 1, 2, 3, or 4.  

Below the table, the following information is written:  
- \( w_{\text{Luft}} = 200 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- \( \dot{m}_{\text{geo}} = ? \, \text{kg/s} \)  
- \( n = 1.4 \)  
- \( c_p = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} = 1006 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg·K}} \)

TASK 2b  
A \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn to represent the thermodynamic process of the jet engine.  

- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \) (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}] \) (specific entropy).  
- The process starts at state 0 and follows a curved line to state 2.  
- From state 2, the process moves upward to state \( p_2 \), then downward to state G.  
- The process continues to state S, then to state 5, and finally to state 6, which is connected back to \( p_0 \).  
- The diagram includes arrows to indicate the direction of the process.  

This diagram qualitatively represents the thermodynamic cycle of the jet engine, including compression, heat addition, expansion, and exhaust.
