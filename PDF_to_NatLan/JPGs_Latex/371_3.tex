TASK 2c  
The jet stream has a velocity \( w_5 = 520 \, \text{m/s} \) and a temperature \( T_0 = 340 \, \text{K} \).  
The change in flow exergy is given by:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = h_e - h_a - T_0 (s_e - s_a) + \Delta ke
\]

---

TASK 2d  
The exergy destruction is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\dot{Q} = -\Delta ex_{\text{str}} + ex_{R} - \dot{W}_t - ex_{\text{vel}}
\]  
The specific exergy destruction is expressed as:  
\[
ex_{\text{vel}} = -109 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + ex_{R} - \dot{W}_t
\]
