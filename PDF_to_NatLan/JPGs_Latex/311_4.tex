TASK 3a  
The initial temperature of the gas is \( T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} \), and the initial volume is \( V_{g,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L} \).  

The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is calculated as:  
\[
A = \frac{\pi}{4} D^2 = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  

The pressure of the gas at state 1 is equal to the pressure exerted by the ice-water mixture:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{EW},1}
\]  

The pressure \( p_{\text{EW},1} \) is determined as:  
\[
p_{\text{EW},1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_K g}{A}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
p_{\text{EW},1} = 1.40 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and volume \( V_{g,1} \) are related to the gas mass \( m_g \) using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,1} V_{g,1} = m_g R_g T_{g,1}
\]  
The specific gas constant \( R_g \) is calculated as:  
\[
R_g = \frac{R}{M_g} = 0.16628 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  

Rearranging for \( m_g \):  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R_g T_{g,1}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
m_g = 3.419 \, \text{grams}
\]  

TASK 3b  
The pressure remains constant during the process:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.40 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas mass \( m_g \) also remains constant.  

The final temperature of the gas \( T_{g,2} \) must equal the equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

It is noted that the ice has not completely melted yet, and the system is still in thermal equilibrium.
