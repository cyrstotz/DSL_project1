TASK 3c  
The system is described as a closed system with gas. The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W
\]  
The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Alternatively, using the specific heat capacity at constant volume \( c_V \), the equation becomes:  
\[
m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Substituting the given values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 3.479 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot (273.15 \, \text{K} - 773.15 \, \text{K})
\]  
The result is:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1082.77 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

TASK 3d  
The energy balance equation is again written as:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W
\]  
Expanding the terms for the system:  
\[
m_{\text{EW},2} \cdot u_{\text{EW},2} + m_{\text{water}} \cdot u_{\text{water,12}} - m_{\text{EW},1} \cdot u_{\text{EW},1} - m_{\text{gas}} \cdot u_{\text{gas,1}} = Q_{12}
\]  

Some terms are crossed out and ignored in the calculation. The equation remains structured for further substitution and evaluation.
