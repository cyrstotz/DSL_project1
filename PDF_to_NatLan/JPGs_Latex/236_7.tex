TASK 4b  
The temperature \( T_2 \) in the evaporator is \( 257.15 \, \text{K} \), as read from Figure 5 (see page 4).  

From Table A-10, the pressure \( p_2 \) at \( 257.15 \, \text{K} \) is interpolated to be:  
\[
p_2 = 1.5748 \, \text{bar}
\]  

From Table A-12, the pressure \( p_2 \) at \( -16^\circ\text{C} \) is interpolated for saturated steam. The saturation temperatures are:  
\[
T_{\text{sat}} = -18.8^\circ\text{C} \quad \text{and} \quad T_{\text{sat}} = -12.73^\circ\text{C}
\]  

Interpolation is performed using the formula:  
\[
y = y_1 + \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} (x - x_1)
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
p_2 = 1.4 \, \text{bar} + \frac{1.8 \, \text{bar} - 1.4 \, \text{bar}}{-12.73^\circ\text{C} - (-18.8^\circ\text{C})} (-16^\circ\text{C} - (-18.8^\circ\text{C}))
\]  
\[
p_2 = 1.588 \, \text{bar}
\]  

From Table A-11, \( h_2 = h_g \) is interpolated for \( 1.588 \, \text{bar} \):  
\[
h_2 = 237.77 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

TASK 4a  
Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a \( p \)-\( T \) plot with pressure \( p \) (in mbar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in \( ^\circ\text{C} \)) on the horizontal axis.  
   - The process is shown as two steps:  
     - Step i is an isobaric process.  
     - Step ii is a sublimation process.  

2. The second diagram is another \( p \)-\( T \) plot with similar axes.  
   - Phase regions are labeled, and the process steps i and ii are indicated.  
   - Step i involves condensation, and step ii involves sublimation.
