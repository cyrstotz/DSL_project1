TASK 3a  
The molar mass of the gas is \( M = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol} \), and the specific heat capacity at constant volume is \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \). The initial temperature of the gas is \( T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} \), and the initial volume is \( V_{g,1} = 5.15 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3 \).  

The gas pressure is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p V = n R T
\]  
where \( R = \frac{R_u}{M} = 166.29 \, \text{J/(kg·K)} \).  

The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is given by:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \left( m_K + m_{\text{EW}} \right) g \frac{1}{A}
\]  
where \( A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \).  

The mass of the gas is calculated as:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{\text{amb}} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} = 0.0056 \, \text{kg} = 5.6 \, \text{g}
\]  

TASK 3b  
The final temperature of the gas is \( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \), and the final pressure is \( p_{g,2} = p_{\text{amb}} = 1.966 \, \text{bar} \).  

**Explanation:**  
Since \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), the ice-water mixture remains in equilibrium, and all the heat added is used for melting ice rather than increasing the temperature. The system reaches thermal equilibrium, meaning the temperature of the gas and the ice-water mixture is the same.  

Regarding pressure: Since the external pressure and the mass remain constant, the pressure \( p \) automatically remains constant as well.  

TASK 3c  
The specific volume of the gas is calculated as:  
\[
v_g = \frac{M R T_{g,1}}{p_{g,1}} = 1.871 \, \text{L}
\]  

The energy balance is given by:  
\[
\Delta U = Q - W
\]  
where \( Q = \Delta U + W = 2233.02 \, \text{J} \).  

The work done is calculated as:  
\[
W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2} p \, dV = p (V_2 - V_1) = -966.62 \, \text{J}
\]  

The change in internal energy is:  
\[
\Delta U = m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1) = -1772.47 \, \text{J}
\]  

The heat transferred is:  
\[
|Q_{12}| = 2233.02 \, \text{J}
\]  

TASK 3d  
The initial ice fraction is \( x_1 = 0.6 \).  

The energy balance for the ice-water mixture is:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{Q} + \dot{W} = 0
\]  
where \( V_{\text{EW}} = \text{const} \).  

The heat transferred is:  
\[
Q = 1 Q_{12}
\]  

The change in internal energy is:  
\[
\Delta U = Q_{12}
\]  

The mass-specific internal energy is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}} + u_1 = -185.1 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The ice fraction at state 2 is determined using the equilibrium table and the energy balance.
