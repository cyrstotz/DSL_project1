TASK 3c  
The heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the formula:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_{g,1} \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) \approx -1092.42 \, \text{J} \quad \left[ \text{kg} \cdot \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} \cdot \text{K} \right]
\]  

Additionally, the final temperature \( T_2 \) is noted as:  
\[
T_2 = 0.003^\circ \text{C}
\]
