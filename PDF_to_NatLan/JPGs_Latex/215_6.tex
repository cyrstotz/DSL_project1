TASK 4c  
An energy balance around the throttle is applied:  
\[
h_1 = h_4
\]  
From interpolation, \( h_1 \) is determined to be \( 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) using \( T_1 = T_2 \) and Table A-10.

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated using the energy balance for the cooling cycle:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
Here, \( \dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{W} \), and the heat input is given by:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1)
\]

TASK 4e  
The temperature would continue to decrease because, as heat flows out, it is no longer available in the form of internal energy.
