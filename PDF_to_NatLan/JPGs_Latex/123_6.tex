TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated as follows:  
\[
x_4 = 0
\]
\[
h_4 = h_1
\]
\[
T_1 = T_4
\]
From Table A-11:  
\[
h_4 = h_1 = 33.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{1.12 \, \text{kW}}{1 \, \text{kW}} = 1.12
\]
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{1.12 \, \text{kW}}{2.83 \, \text{kW}} = 0.429
\]

TASK 4e  
The energy balance for the cooling process is expressed as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_2 - h_1) + \dot{Q}_K
\]
Rearranging:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_2 - h_1)
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = 0.053 \, (238.08 - 33.42) = 12 \, \text{kW}
\]

Additionally, it is noted that:  
Water immediately transitions into the gas phase.
