TASK 2a  
The page contains a diagram illustrating a thermodynamic process on a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  

The diagram includes several curves and points labeled with numbers:  
1. Point 0 is the starting state.  
2. Point 1 is connected to point 0 via an isobaric compression curve.  
3. Point 2 is connected to point 1 via an isobaric combustion curve.  
4. Point 3 is connected to point 2 via an adiabatic expansion curve.  
5. Point 4 is connected to point 3 via a mixing process.  
6. Point 5 is connected to point 4 via an isobaric cooling curve.  

The curves are annotated with descriptions such as "isobaric compression," "isobaric combustion," "adiabatic expansion," and "isobaric cooling."  

This diagram qualitatively represents the thermodynamic process of a jet engine, as described in the problem setup for Task 2.
