TASK 2a  
The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and process steps:  
- State 1 to 2: Adiabatic reversible compression.  
- State 2 to 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 3 to 4: Adiabatic reversible expansion in the turbine.  
- State 4 to 5: Mixing of bypass and core streams, resulting in a pressure of \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- State 5 to 6: Adiabatic reversible expansion in the nozzle, ending at ambient pressure \( 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  

The diagram also shows arrows indicating the flow of mass (\( \dot{m}_K \) and \( \dot{m}_M \)) and heat transfer (\( \dot{Q}_B \)).

TASK 2b  
The outlet temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} = 328.075 \, \text{K}
\]

TASK 2c  
The kinetic energy change (\( \Delta KE \)) is ignored. The work \( W \) is calculated using:  
\[
W = \sqrt{2 \, (h_6 - h_5)}
\]  
The integral form of work is given as:  
\[
KE = W = \int_{5}^{6} p \, dV
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated using:  
\[
\frac{w_6^2}{2} = \frac{\kappa}{\kappa - 1} \, (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\frac{w_6^2}{2} = c_p \, \Delta T = 92.95 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
\[
w_6^2 = 92.95 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \Rightarrow \quad w_6 = 430 \, \text{m/s}
\]
