TASK 2b  
The equation of state for an ideal gas is given as \( p v = R T \), which implies that \( \frac{p}{R} = \text{const} = \frac{T}{v} \).  

The temperature \( T_6 \) is equal to \( T_5 \), as the process is adiabatic.  

The ratio of temperatures is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_1} = \frac{T_5}{T_1}
\]

TASK 2d  
The mass-specific exergy destruction is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\frac{\dot{e}_{\text{dest}}}{\dot{m}_{\text{gas}}} = e_{1,\text{mod}} - e_{2,\text{mod}} - T_0 \frac{\dot{S}_{\text{gen}}}{\dot{m}_{\text{gas}}}
\]
