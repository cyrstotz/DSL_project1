TASK 4a  
A diagram is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled phase regions and states:  
- State 1: MD (moisture-laden air) inlet.  
- State 3: Compressor outlet.  
- State 4: Condenser outlet.  
- Sublimation line is marked.  
- The diagram shows transitions between states with arrows, indicating the process flow.  

TASK 4b  
The condenser is described with the following equilibrium relations:  
\[
p_2 = 3 \, \text{bar}
\]
\[
h_2 = h_{3 \, \text{bar}}
\]
\[
h_2 = h_{3 \, \text{bar}} + \frac{3 \, \text{bar} - 2.5 \, \text{bar}}{3.2 \, \text{bar} - 2.5 \, \text{bar}} \cdot (h_{2.5 \, \text{bar}} - h_{3.2 \, \text{bar}})
\]
The heat transfer \( Q \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K
\]
\[
\dot{W}_K = \frac{\dot{Q}}{\epsilon_K}
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
Q = 24.7 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
Entropy relations are given:  
\[
s_3 = s_2 = s_{2g} \rightarrow s_3
\]
\[
s_3 = (0.25 \, \text{kg}) \cdot (C_{p, \text{air}} - C_{p, \text{water}})
\]
\[
s_3 = 0.5147
\]

TASK 4c  
The expansion valve is described with the following relations:  
\[
h_4 = h_{f \, (8 \, \text{bar})} = 264.15 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
\[
h_4 = h_{f} + x \cdot (h_{g \, (p_2)} - h_{f \, (p_2)})
\]
\[
x = \frac{h_4 - h_{f}}{h_{g} - h_{f}}
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
T_Z = -22^\circ\text{C}
\]
\[
p_{11} = p_{2} = 2 \, \text{bar}
\]
