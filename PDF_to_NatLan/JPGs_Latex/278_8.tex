TASK 4a  
Two diagrams are drawn on the page:

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The graph is labeled with \( p \, [\text{bar}] \) on the y-axis and \( T \, [\text{K}] \) on the x-axis.  
   - The curve appears to represent a phase diagram with multiple oscillations. The oscillations suggest transitions between different phases or processes, but no specific annotations are provided beyond the axes labels.

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - The graph is labeled with \( q \, [\text{bar}] \) on the y-axis and \( T \, [\text{K}] \) on the x-axis.  
   - The curve is annotated with the following labels:  
     - "fed" near the lower part of the curve.  
     - "isotherm" along a horizontal section of the curve.  
     - "flowing gas" near the middle section.  
   - The curve seems to represent a thermodynamic process, possibly involving isothermal and gas flow regions.  

Descriptions of the graphs are limited due to the lack of detailed annotations.
