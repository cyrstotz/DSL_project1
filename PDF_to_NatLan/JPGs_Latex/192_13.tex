TASK 2a  
The enthalpy values are given as:  
\[
h_2 = 237.74 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad h_3 = 271.3 \, \text{kJ/kg}.
\]  

The first law of thermodynamics is applied for the process from state 2 to state 3:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_3) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}.
\]  

The work term is rearranged as:  
\[
\frac{\dot{W}}{h_2 - h_3} = \dot{m}.
\]  

The heat transfer is noted as adiabatic (\( \dot{Q} = 0 \)), and the work term is given as \( -28 \, \text{kW} \). The mass flow rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m} = 0.834 \, \text{kg/s}.
\]  

TASK 2c  
For safety, the mass flow rate is adjusted to:  
\[
\dot{m} = 4 \, \text{kg/h} = \frac{4}{3600} \, \text{kg/s}.
\]  

The first law of thermodynamics is applied for the process:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_K.
\]  

Rearranging the equation:  
\[
-\frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{m}} + h_2 = h_1.
\]  

The enthalpy values are given as:  
\[
h_3 = 271.3 \, \text{kJ/kg}.
\]  

For the isochoric process from state 3 to state 4:  
\[
p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar}, \quad x = 0, \quad h_4 = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}).
\]  

The enthalpy at state 4 is calculated as:  
\[
h_4 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}.
\]  

Using the energy balance:  
\[
\dot{m}(h_3 - h_4) + \dot{Q} = 0.
\]  

The heat transfer is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q} = 0.198 \, \text{kW}.
\]  

Finally, for the cyclic process:  
\[
W + E_{\text{cycle}} = 0.
