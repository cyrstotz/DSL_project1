TASK 2a  
The graph is a qualitative representation of the thermodynamic process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as entropy \( s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}] \), and the y-axis is labeled as temperature \( T \, [\text{K}] \).  

The diagram includes several curves and points:  
- Two isobars are labeled \( p_0 \) and \( p_1 = k \cdot p_0 \), indicating different pressure levels.  
- The process begins at point 2 and progresses through points 3, 4, and 5, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
- The curves show the thermodynamic transitions between states, with entropy increasing along the x-axis.  

TASK 2d  
A schematic diagram is drawn showing a control volume with labeled inlet and outlet velocities:  
- \( w_5 \) represents the velocity at the inlet.  
- \( w_6 \) represents the velocity at the outlet.  
- The heat transfer \( q_{AB} \) is indicated within the control volume.
