TASK 2a  
The following constants and assumptions are provided:  
- \( c_p = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \)  
- \( n = \kappa = 1.4 \)  
- Potential energy (\( PE \)) is negligible (\( PE = 0 \)).  

A table is presented summarizing the states of the jet engine process:  
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{State} & p \, (\text{bar}) & T \, (^\circ\text{C}) & s \, (\text{entropy}) \\
\hline
0 & 0.191 & -30 & \\
1 & p_1 > p_0 & T_1 > T_0 & \\
2 & & & s_1 = s_2 \\
3 & p_3 = p_2 & & \\
4 & & & s_3 < s_4 \\
5 & p_4 = p_5 = 0.5 & T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} & \\
6 & & & s_5 = s_6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

TASK 2b  
A graph is drawn representing the jet engine process on a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in \( ^\circ\text{C} \).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \).  

Key features of the graph:  
- The process begins at state \( 0 \) and progresses through states \( 1 \) to \( 6 \).  
- States \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) are connected by an isentropic line (constant entropy).  
- States \( 3 \) to \( 4 \) follow an isobaric line (constant pressure).  
- States \( 4 \) to \( 5 \) are connected by another isentropic line.  
- States \( 5 \) to \( 6 \) follow an isothermal line (constant temperature).  
- The pressure at state \( 5 \) is labeled as \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  

The graph visually represents the thermodynamic processes occurring in the jet engine, including isentropic and isothermal transitions.
