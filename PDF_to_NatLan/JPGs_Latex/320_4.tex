TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn representing a T-s diagram (temperature vs. entropy). The diagram includes labeled points and curves:  
- Points labeled as \( 0 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 5 \), and \( A \).  
- Curves labeled \( p_3 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_1/p_0 \).  
- The process transitions between these points, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
- The pressure ratio \( p_1/p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) is noted next to the diagram.

TASK 2b  
The temperature \( T_b \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
T_b = T_0 \left( \frac{p_5}{p_0} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_b = 431.9 \, \text{K} \quad \text{(calculated using \( T_0 = 431.9 \, \text{K}, p_5 = 0.3 \, \text{bar}, p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}, n = 1.4 \))}
\]  
The result is:  
\[
T_b = 568.58 \, \text{K}
\]

Additional calculations are partially visible but crossed out. Relevant equations include:  
- Energy balance for the nozzle:  
\[
0 = h_5 - h_6 + \frac{1}{2} w_5^2 - \frac{1}{2} w_6^2
\]  
- Velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated using:  
\[
w_6^2 = 2 \cdot c_p^{\text{air}} (T_5 - T_b) + w_5^2
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
c_p^{\text{air}} = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}, \, T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}, \, T_b = 340 \, \text{K}, \, w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s}
\]  
Intermediate result:  
\[
w_6^2 = 2429.2454 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
\]  
Final velocity:  
\[
w_6 = 341.72 \, \text{m/s}
\]
