TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn with pressure \( P \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The curve resembles a phase diagram with a peak labeled "KP" (likely the critical point). The left side of the curve represents the liquid phase, and the right side represents the vapor phase. Two steps are marked:  
- Step \( i \): A horizontal line moves from the liquid phase to the vapor phase, indicating isobaric evaporation.  
- Step \( ii \): A vertical line moves downward, indicating a reduction in pressure.  

TASK 4e  
"It would always become colder."  

TASK 4b  
An energy balance equation is written:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
The temperature \( T_i \) is given as \( 4^\circ\text{C} \).  

TASK 4c  
The vapor quality at state 2 is given as:  
\[
x_{2,\text{R134a}} = 0
\]  

TASK 4c  
The vapor quality at state 1 is referenced but no further information is provided.
