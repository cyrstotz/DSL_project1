TASK 2a  
The equation for the rate of change of entropy is given as:  
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i(t) s_i(t) + \int \frac{\dot{Q}(t)}{T_G(t)} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}(t)
\]

TASK 2b  
A temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(S\)) diagram is drawn. The diagram includes the following labeled processes:  
- An isobaric process from state 2 to state 3.  
- An isochoric process from state 3 to state 4.  
- An isobaric process from state 4 to state 5.  
- An isentropic process from state 5 to state 6.  

The axes are labeled:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature (\(T\)) in kilojoules (\(kJ\)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy (\(S\)) in kilojoules per kilogram (\(kJ/kg\)).  

The states are connected with lines to represent the transitions between processes.
