TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The axes are labeled as pressure (\( p \)) and temperature (\( T \)), with a curve showing phase transitions. Three states are marked: state 1, state 2, and state 3, connected by arrows indicating the process flow.

TASK 4b  
The refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is requested but not calculated. The equation or solution is missing.

---

TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) at state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = \frac{234.85 - 42.29}{232.85 - 492.25} = 1.0091
\]  
The enthalpy \( h_1 \) at \( T = -22^\circ\text{C} \) is determined using interpolation:  
\[
h_1[T = -22^\circ\text{C}] = \frac{237.35 - 236.55}{-26.43 + 20} \cdot (-2) + 236.55 = 234.93
\]

---

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is expressed as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_K \) is requested but not calculated.

TASK 4e  
A statement is written:  
"Approximation of the temperature of the coolant."  
No further explanation or calculation is provided.
