TASK 2a  
The page contains a table and calculations related to thermodynamic properties and processes.  

### Table Description:  
The table includes the following columns:  
- \( p \) (pressure in bar)  
- \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin)  
- \( w \) (velocity in \( \text{m/s} \))  
- Flow designation (e.g., \( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \), \( \dot{m}_K \), etc.)  

The rows are labeled with states (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 0).  
- At state 5:  
  \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = 431.9 \, \text{K} \), \( w = 220 \, \text{m/s} \), flow designation \( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \).  

- At state 0:  
  \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = 243.15 \, \text{K} \), \( w = 200 \, \text{m/s} \).  

The table also includes a note indicating "isentrop" (likely referring to an isentropic process).

### Calculations:  
The following thermodynamic relationships are calculated:  

1. Specific heat at constant pressure:  
   \[
   c_p = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
   \]

2. Ratio of specific heats:  
   \[
   k = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = 1.4
   \]

3. Specific heat at constant volume:  
   \[
   c_v = \frac{c_p}{k} = \frac{1.006}{1.4} = 0.719 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
   \]

4. Gas constant:  
   \[
   R = c_p - c_v = 1.006 - 0.719 = 0.287 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
   \]
