TASK 3a  
The problem involves determining the gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) in state 1.  

Given:  
- \( M_g = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol} \)  
- \( p_2 = p_{\text{amb}} \)  

The force balance equation is:  
\[
p_{g,1} \cdot A = p_{\text{amb}} \cdot A + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot g + m_K \cdot g
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + g \cdot \frac{m_{\text{EW}} + m_K}{A}
\]  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is calculated as:  
\[
A = \pi r^2 = \pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{0.1}{2}\right)^2 = 7.85 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^2
\]  

The gas constant \( R \) is determined as:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g} = \frac{8.314}{50} = 0.1663 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  

Using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,1} \cdot V_{g,1} = m_g \cdot R \cdot T_{g,1}
\]  
Rearranging for \( m_g \):  
\[
m_g = \frac{R \cdot T_{g,1}}{p_{g,1} \cdot V_{g,1}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
m_g = 0.282 \, \text{g}
\]

TASK 3b  
The problem involves determining \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \).  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \) because the system reaches equilibrium with no external force changes. This is due to the equal density of water and ice and the constant volume.  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The equilibrium temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is the same as the final temperature of the ice-water mixture, which is \( T_{EW,2} \).  

Additional crossed-out equations and text are ignored as per instructions.  

The explanation concludes with:  
Since the ice-water mixture in the cylinder has not completely melted, the temperature must remain at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) until all ice is melted, as this is the phase equilibrium temperature.
