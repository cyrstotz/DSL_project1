TASK 3c  
The steady-state flow process is described with the following equations and calculations:  

The mass flow rate is given as:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot (h_e - h_a) = 0
\]  

The enthalpy at the exit is equal to the enthalpy at the inlet at 8 bar:  
\[
h_a = h_e = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 33.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The temperature at the inlet is:  
\[
T_f = T_f = -16^\circ\text{C}
\]  

The enthalpy at the saturated liquid state is:  
\[
h_{fg} = 233.74
\]  

The enthalpy at the final state is calculated as:  
\[
h_f = 233.74 - 25.77 - (-16 + 18) \cdot 25.77 = 29.3 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_f \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_f = \frac{33.42 - 29.3}{233.74 - 29.3} = 0.3076
\]
