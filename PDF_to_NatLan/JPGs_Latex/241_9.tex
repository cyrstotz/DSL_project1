TASK 4a  
The table contains thermodynamic data for four states labeled 1 through 4. The columns represent pressure (\(P\)), temperature (\(T\)), entropy (\(S\)), and enthalpy (\(H\)). The vapor quality (\(x\)) is specified for each state:  

- \(x_1 = 0.9\):  
  \(P = 2.268 \, \text{bar}\), \(T = -6 \, ^\circ\text{C}\), \(S = 200.45 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}\), \(H = 262.18 \, \text{kJ/kg}\).  

- \(x_2 = 1\):  
  \(P = 2.268 \, \text{bar}\), \(T = -6 \, ^\circ\text{C}\), \(S = \text{not provided}\), \(H = 267.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}\).  

- \(x_3 = 1\):  
  \(P = 8 \, \text{bar}\), \(T = \text{not provided}\), \(S = \text{not provided}\), \(H = \text{not provided}\).  

- \(x_4 = 0\):  
  \(P = 8 \, \text{bar}\), \(T = \text{not provided}\), \(S = \text{not provided}\), \(H = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}\).

Below the table, a graph is drawn to represent the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\(P\)-\(T\)) diagram.  

The graph shows:  
- A curve labeled "isobar" connecting states 1 and 2.  
- A vertical line labeled "isobar" connecting states 3 and 4.  
- The axes are labeled \(P\) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \(T\) (temperature) on the horizontal axis.  
- State points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked clearly along the curve and lines.
