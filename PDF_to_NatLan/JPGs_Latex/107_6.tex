TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn showing the relationship between pressure (labeled as "Druck [bar]") and temperature (labeled as "Temperatur [Â°C]"). The graph includes two distinct curves:  
- One curve starts at the origin and rises steadily, representing the liquid phase region.  
- The second curve diverges sharply upward, representing the vapor phase region.  
The graph visually depicts phase regions in a pressure-temperature diagram.

TASK 4b  
The initial temperature \( T_i \) is given as:  
\[
T_i = -10^\circ\text{C}
\]
