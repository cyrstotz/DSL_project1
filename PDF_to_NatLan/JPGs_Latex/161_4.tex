TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_g \) is calculated as the sum of the ambient pressure \( p_{\text{amb}} \) and the pressure exerted by the piston \( p_w \):  
\[
p_g = p_{\text{amb}} + p_w
\]  
The pressure exerted by the piston is determined using the formula:  
\[
p_w = \frac{m_K g}{A}
\]  
where \( m_K = 32 \, \text{kg} \), \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( A = \frac{\pi}{4} D^2 \). Substituting the values:  
\[
p_w = \frac{32 \cdot 9.81}{\frac{\pi}{4} \cdot (0.1)^2} = 39953.52 \, \text{Pa}
\]  
Thus:  
\[
p_g = 1 \, \text{bar} + 39953.52 \, \text{Pa} = 1.1 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas mass \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_g V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}}
\]  
Substituting \( p_g = 1.1 \, \text{bar} \), \( V_{g,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L} = 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3 \), \( R = 0.82 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \), and \( T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} = 773.15 \, \text{K} \):  
\[
m_g = \frac{1.1 \cdot 10^5 \cdot 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3}}{0.82 \cdot 773.15} = 3.4 \, \text{g}
\]  

The specific gas constant \( R_g \) is calculated as:  
\[
R_g = \frac{R}{M_g} = \frac{0.82}{50} = 0.0164 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]

TASK 3b  
The pressure \( p_g \) in state 2 is equal to the pressure \( p_{\text{amb}} \):  
\[
p_g = p_{\text{amb}}
\]  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to the equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{EW}} \):  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}}
\]  

The ice-water mixture (EW) is incompressible, so the pressure in EW does not change. The equilibrium between EW and gas ensures that \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}} \). At \( T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} \), the system is in equilibrium, and the mixture consists of solid and liquid phases.

TASK 3c  
The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_p \Delta T
\]  
where \( c_p = 0.8 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \) and \( \Delta T = T_{g,1} - T_{g,2} = 500^\circ\text{C} - 0^\circ\text{C} = 500^\circ\text{C} \). Substituting \( m_g = 3.4 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \):  
\[
Q_{12} = 3.4 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 0.8 \cdot 500 = 1.36 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

Thus, the heat transferred is approximately \( Q_{12} = 1.36 \, \text{kJ} \).
