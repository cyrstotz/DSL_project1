TASK 1c  
The entropy production rate \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_R} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{358 \, \text{K}} - \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{255 \, \text{K}} = -0.0387 \, \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}}
\]  

The thermodynamic mean temperature of the reactor is given by:  
\[
T_R = \frac{100^\circ\text{C} + 70^\circ\text{C}}{2} = 85^\circ\text{C} = 358 \, \text{K}
\]  

The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = 255 \, \text{K}
\]  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 65 \, \text{kW}
\]

TASK 1d  
The following values are provided:  
\[
T_1 = 100^\circ\text{C} = 373 \, \text{K}, \quad T_2 = 70^\circ\text{C} = 343 \, \text{K}, \quad T_w = 20^\circ\text{C} = 293 \, \text{K}
\]  
The heat released during cooling is:  
\[
Q_R = Q_{\text{out}} = 35 \, \text{MJ}
\]  
The total reactor mass is:  
\[
m_{\text{total}} = 5755 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The change in internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U = U_2 - U_1 = Q_R - Q_1
\]  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} h_i + \dot{Q}
\]
