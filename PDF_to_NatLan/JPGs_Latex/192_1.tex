TASK 1b  
The heat capacity \( c \) is constant. The thermodynamic mean temperature \( \bar{T} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\bar{T} = \frac{(T_2 - T_1)}{\ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)}
\]  
where:  
\[
T_2 = 298.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_1 = 288.15 \, \text{K}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\bar{T} = 293.12 \, \text{K}
\]

TASK 1c  
To calculate the entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \), the heat flow \( \dot{Q} \) is considered.  

A sketch is provided showing a reactor system with labeled components, including a boundary (marked "Mantel") and heat flow direction.  

The entropy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t} = \frac{\dot{Q}}{\bar{T}} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  

Given:  
\[
\dot{Q} = -62.3 \, \text{kW}, \quad \bar{T} = 293.12 \, \text{K}
\]  

The entropy production is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 0.213 \, \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}}
\]  

This value is underlined in the solution.  

Description of sketch:  
The diagram shows a reactor system with a boundary labeled "Mantel" and arrows indicating heat flow. The system boundary is clearly marked, and the heat transfer direction is shown.
