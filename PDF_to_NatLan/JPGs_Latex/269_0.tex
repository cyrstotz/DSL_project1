TASK 2a  
The page begins with a graph labeled as a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram qualitatively represents the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. It includes labeled isobars and states:  
- State 5 (\( p_5 \)) and State 6 (\( p_6 \)) are marked.  
- The curve transitions from state 5 to state 6, showing heat transfer and entropy changes.  
- Axes are labeled: \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (specific entropy, \( \text{kJ/kg·K} \)) on the horizontal axis.  

TASK 2b  
The following equations and calculations are provided:  

1. The energy balance equation:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} (h_6 - h_5) \cdot t - \dot{W}
\]

2. Calculation of \( T_6 \):  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} = 328.071 \, \text{K}
\]

3. Reversible work calculation:  
\[
\dot{W}_{\text{rev}} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_5 - h_6) = \dot{m} \cdot c_p (T_5 - T_6) = 104.45 \, \text{kW}
\]

4. Expanded reversible work equation:  
\[
\dot{W}_{\text{rev}} = \int_5^6 v \, dp + \left( \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_5^2}{2} \right)
\]

5. Integration for work:  
\[
\int_5^6 v \, dp = -n \int_5^6 p \, dv = -\frac{n}{n-1} R (T_6 - T_5) = -104.45 \, \text{kW}
\]

Additional constants and relationships are provided:  
- \( n = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = 1.4 \)  
- \( c_v = 0.7186 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)  
- \( R = c_p - c_v = 0.287 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)
