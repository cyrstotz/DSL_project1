TASK 2a  
The graph is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram.  
- The x-axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kg·K} \).  
- The y-axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin (\( \text{K} \)).  
- The labeled points correspond to different states in the jet engine process:  
  - \( p_0 = p_6 \)  
  - \( p_4 = p_5 \)  
  - \( p_2 = p_3 \)  
- The curves indicate isobaric processes, and the transitions between states show compression, combustion, and expansion.  

TASK 2b  
The process from state 5 to state 6 is isentropic, which implies \( \Delta s = 0 \).  

The entropy equation is given as:  
\[
0 = c_p \ln\left(\frac{T_6}{T_5}\right) - R \ln\left(\frac{p_c}{p_5}\right)
\]  

The ratio of specific heats is:  
\[
\eta = \frac{c_p}{c_v}, \quad c_v = \frac{c_p}{\eta} = \frac{1.006}{1.4} = 0.7186 \, \text{kJ}/\text{kg·K}
\]  

The gas constant is:  
\[
R = c_p - c_v = 1.006 - 0.7186 = 0.2874 \, \text{kJ}/\text{kg·K}
\]  

The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 e^{\frac{R}{c_p} \ln\left(\frac{p_c}{p_5}\right)}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \cdot e^{\frac{0.2874}{1.006} \ln\left(\frac{0.191}{0.5}\right)}  
\]  
\[
T_6 = 328.084 \, \text{K}
\]  

The velocity \( w_6 \) is determined using the energy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left(h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2}\right) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W} = 0
\]  

Rearranging for \( w_6 \):  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 h_5 - 2 h_6 + w_5^2} - \sqrt{2 \left(c_p (T_5 - T_6)\right) + w_5^2}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot 1.006 \cdot (431.9 - 328.084) + 220^2}  
\]  
\[
w_6 = 507.23 \, \text{m/s}
\]
