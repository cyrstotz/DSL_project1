TASK 1e  
The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated using the following equation:  

\[
\Delta S = (m_{\text{tot}} + m_{12}) s_2 (at \, T = 70^\circ\text{C}) - m_A s_1 (at \, T = 100^\circ\text{C}) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{ab}}}{T_{\text{oil}}}
\]

A simple diagram is drawn showing two boxes labeled with temperatures \( 100^\circ\text{C} \) and \( 70^\circ\text{C} \), connected by an arrow indicating heat transfer \( \dot{Q}_{\text{ab}} \).
