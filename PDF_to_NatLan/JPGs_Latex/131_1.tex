TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn representing a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is \( T \) (temperature) in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- The horizontal axis is \( s \) (entropy) in \( \frac{J}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  

The diagram includes several labeled processes:  
- A point labeled "1" marks the initial state.  
- A curve labeled "isentropic" connects state 1 to state 2.  
- A zigzag line labeled "combustion" connects state 2 to state 3.  
- A horizontal line labeled "adiabatic, irreversible" connects state 3 to state 4.  
- A curve labeled "turbine" connects state 4 to state 5.  
- A curve labeled "nozzle" connects state 5 to state 6.  

TASK 2b  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \Delta E = \dot{m} \left( h + \frac{w^2}{2} \right) + \sum Q - \sum W
\]  
The ideal gas law is stated:  
\[
pV = mRT
\]  
The temperature at ambient conditions (\( T_0 \)) is expressed as:  
\[
T_0 = \frac{p_0 V_0}{m c_p R}
\]  

The mass flow rate is defined as:  
\[
M_c = m_s
\]  
The temperature at state \( s \) (\( T_s \)) is derived as:  
\[
T_s = \frac{p_c V_c}{R T_c} = \frac{p_s V_s}{R T_s} + \frac{p_0 V_0}{c_p R}
\]  

TASK 2c  
The equation for mass flow rate is given:  
\[
\dot{m} \dot{e}_{\text{ext}} = \dot{m} \left[ h - h_0 - T_0 (s - s_0) \right]
\]  

TASK 2d  
The specific exergy destruction is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{\Delta ex_{\text{vel}}}{m} = T_0 \Delta s + ex_{\text{vel}}
\]
