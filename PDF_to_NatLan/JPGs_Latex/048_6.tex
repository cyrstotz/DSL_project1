TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is given by:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\left| \dot{Q}_K - \dot{Q}_{ab} \right|}{\left| \dot{W}_K \right|}
\]

TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) of the refrigerant at state 1 after expansion is calculated as:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = \frac{h_4 - h_f(p_1)}{h_g(p_1) - h_f(p_1)}
\]
