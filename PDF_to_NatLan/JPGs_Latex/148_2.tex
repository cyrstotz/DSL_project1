TASK 4b  
The heat transfer rate is calculated using the equation:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) = 28 \, \text{W}
\]  
From Table A-14:  
\[
h_2 = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 263.95 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The section labeled "Drossel isenthalp" is crossed out and ignored.  

The enthalpy at state 1 is given as:  
\[
h_1 = h_2
\]  

TASK 4b (continued)  
The heat removed is calculated using:  
\[
Q_{\text{ab}} = \dot{m} (u_2 - u_1) - \dot{W}_k
\]  
Where:  
\[
T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C}
\]  

From Table A-14:  
\[
u_2 = 264.08 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \quad \text{(value for } u_g \text{ at } -22^\circ\text{C)}  
\]  

From Table A-11:  
\[
u_3 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \quad \text{(value for } h_f \text{ at } 8 \, \text{bar)}  
\]  

The mass flow rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{(234.08 - 93.42)}{u_g} = 0.0000199 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}}
\]  

TASK 4c  
The enthalpy at state 4 is calculated as:  
\[
h_4 = h_1 = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The pressure difference is calculated under the assumption that \( T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C} \):  
\[
p_1 - p_2 = 1.2192 \, \text{bar}
\]  

From Table A-10:  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = \frac{93.42 - 21.77}{234.08 - 21.77} = 0.837
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance is calculated using:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{\dot{W}_k}
\]
