TASK 3c  

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is calculated using the heat transfer equation:  
\[
\Delta U = Q
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q = m_{\text{EW}} c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
where \( T_2 \) and \( T_1 \) are the final and initial temperatures, respectively.  

The heat transferred to the ice-water mixture is given as:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1.469 \, \text{MJ}
\]

TASK 3d  

The internal energy change is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
\Delta U = \Sigma Q
\]  

The equation for \( u_2 \) is derived as:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
\[
u_2 = -\frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}} + u_1
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = -\frac{-1.469}{0.1} + (-200.0928)
\]  
\[
u_2 = -181.9238 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The ice fraction \( x_2 \) is calculated using the equilibrium equation:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_{\text{flüssig}}}{u_{\text{fest}} - u_{\text{flüssig}}}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{-181.9238 - (-333.458)}{-200.0928 - (-333.458)}
\]  
\[
x_2 = 0.05662
\]  

Expressing \( x_2 \) as a percentage:  
\[
x_2 = 5.662 \, \%
\]  

Additional notes:  
- \( c_p = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \), \( c_V = 0.46672 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \).
