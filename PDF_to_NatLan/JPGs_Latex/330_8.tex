TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_g \) is expressed as:  
\[
p_g = p_{\text{amb}} + p_{\text{piston}} + p_{\text{EW}}
\]  
where \( p_{\text{piston}} \) is given by:  
\[
p_{\text{piston}} = \frac{\eta_{\text{bar}} + A m_g}{A} + \frac{m_{\text{EW}} g}{A}
\]  
The gas mass \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
m_g = \frac{RT}{pV}, \quad R = \frac{R}{M_g}
\]

TASK 3b  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is constant because the ice remains partially unmelted.  
The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) remains unchanged.

TASK 3c  
Energy balance equations are provided:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum Q - \sum W
\]  
The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U = Q_{12} - \int_{1}^{2} p \, dv
\]
