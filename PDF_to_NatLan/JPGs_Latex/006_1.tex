The entropy change \( \Delta S \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated as follows:

The entropy at state 1 (\( S_1 \)) is given by:  
\[
S_1 = 1.3069 + 0.005 \cdot (7.3549 - 1.3069)
\]  
\[
S_1 = 1.337 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  
The total entropy at state 1 is:  
\[
S_1 = 1.337 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \cdot 5755 \, \text{kg} = 7694.435 \, \text{kJ/K}
\]

The entropy at state 2 (\( S_2 \)) is given by:  
\[
S_2 = 0.9549
\]  
The total entropy at state 2 is:  
\[
S_2 = 0.9549 \cdot 9517.67 = 9087.694 \, \text{kJ/K}
\]

The entropy change (\( \Delta S \)) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S = S_2 - S_1
\]  
\[
\Delta S = 9087.694 - 7694.435 = 1387.259 \, \text{kJ/K}
\]
