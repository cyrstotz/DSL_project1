TASK 2a  
The graph represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis, and entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis. The curve shows the thermodynamic process with labeled points:  
- Point \( 0 \): Initial state.  
- Point \( 1 \): Compression process.  
- Point \( 2 \): Combustion process.  
- Point \( 3 \): Expansion in the turbine.  
- Point \( 4 \): Mixing process.  

TASK 2b  
The ideal gas equation is given as:  
\[
p \cdot v = R \cdot T
\]  
The polytropic temperature relationship for a reversible, adiabatic process is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
For the nozzle process, the temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the pressure ratio:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \cdot \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 328.1 \, \text{K}
\]  

TASK 2c  
The energy balance for the nozzle process (from state 5 to state 6) is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right) - \dot{W}_5
\]  
This equation accounts for enthalpy differences, kinetic energy changes, and work done in the nozzle.
