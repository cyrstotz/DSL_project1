TASK 2a  
The specific heat capacity at constant pressure is given as:  
\[
c_{p} = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
The ratio of specific heats is:  
\[
\kappa = 1.4
\]  

A graph is drawn representing a temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(s\)) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is \(T\) (temperature) in unspecified units.  
- The horizontal axis is \(s\) (entropy) in \(\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}\).  

The diagram includes several curves and labeled points:  
- Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked.  
- The process between points is described with labels such as "isobar," "adiabatic irreversible," and "isobar."  
- The curves represent thermodynamic processes, including isentropic and isobaric transitions.  

TASK 2b  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
h_0 - h_6 + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} = 0
\]  
Rearranging for \(w_6\):  
\[
w_6^2 = 2(h_0 - h_6) + w_0^2
\]  
Taking the square root:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2(h_0 - h_6) + w_0^2}
\]  
Substituting \(h_0 - h_6 = c_p(T_0 - T_6)\):  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 c_p (T_0 - T_6) + w_0^2}
\]  

The specific heat capacity is again noted as:  
\[
c_p = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]
