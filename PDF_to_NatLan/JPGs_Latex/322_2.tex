TASK 2a  
The graph depicts a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The x-axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \frac{\text{MJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \), and the y-axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process paths. Key features include:  
- A curved path representing the compression process.  
- A peak indicating the combustion process.  
- A descending curve for the turbine process.  
- Isobars are drawn as horizontal lines.  

TASK 2b  
The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) and temperature \( T_6 \) are determined using the energy balance for the adiabatic nozzle process:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot (\dot{h}_5 - \dot{h}_6) + w_5^2 - w_0^2}
\]  
The enthalpy difference \( h_6 - h_5 \) is calculated as:  
\[
h_6 - h_5 = \int_{T_5}^{T_6} c_p \, dT = c_p (T_6 - T_5)
\]  
For the compression process, the temperature ratio is derived using the polytropic relation:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \cdot \left( \frac{0.191 \, \text{bar}}{0.5 \, \text{bar}} \right)^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}} = 326.07 \, \text{K}
\]  
The enthalpy difference is:  
\[
h_6 - h_5 = c_p (T_6 - T_5) = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \cdot (326.07 \, \text{K} - 431.9 \, \text{K}) = -106.45 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
Finally, the outlet velocity is:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot (-106.45 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}) + w_5^2} = 243.54 \, \text{m/s}
\]  

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_{\text{flow},6} - ex_{\text{flow},0}
\]  
The flow exergy at state 6 is:  
\[
ex_{\text{flow},6} = (h_6 - h_0) - T_0 (s_6 - s_0)
\]
