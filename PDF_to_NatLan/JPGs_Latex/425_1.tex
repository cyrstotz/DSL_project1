TASK 2a  
The diagram is a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) plot illustrating the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. The process includes labeled isobars and states:  
- State 0 represents the ambient condition.  
- State 1 is the inlet to the compressor.  
- State 2 is the outlet of the compressor.  
- State 3 is the combustion chamber outlet.  
- State 5 is the mixing chamber outlet.  
- State 6 is the nozzle exit.  

The diagram shows the following:  
- Isobaric lines are drawn for \( p_0 \), \( p_1 = p_2 = p_5 \), and \( p_3 \).  
- The process from state 1 to state 2 is labeled as isentropic compression.  
- The process from state 3 to state 5 is labeled as isobaric heat addition.  
- The process from state 5 to state 6 is labeled as isentropic expansion.  
- The entropy axis (\( s \)) is labeled with units of \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).

TASK 2b  
Energy balance at the nozzle:  
The following parameters are given:  
\[
w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s}, \quad p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}, \quad T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K},  
\]
\[
p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}, \quad T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} = 243.15 \, \text{K}.
\]

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right] - \dot{W}_{t,56}.
\]

The turbine work is expressed as:  
\[
W_{t,56} = \int v \, dp + s \, dke = -RT_5 \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right) + \frac{w_6^2 - w_5^2}{2}.
\]

The specific volume at state 5 is given as:  
\[
v_5 = \frac{RT_5}{p_5}.
\]

The enthalpy difference and velocity terms are summarized as:  
\[
Q = h_5 - h_6 + w_6^2 - w_5^2.
\]
