The equation for \( u_2 \) is given as:  
\[
u_2 = -152.2 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The pressure condition is stated as:  
\[
p_{\text{EW}} = p_{\text{ice-water}} = p_{\text{EW}}
\]  

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
u_2 = u_{\text{EL}} + x_2 (u_{\text{ice}} - u_{\text{EL}})
\]  

Rearranging to solve for \( x_2 \):  
\[
x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_{\text{EL}}}{u_{\text{ice}} - u_{\text{EL}}}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{-152.2 - (-0.450)}{-333.97 - (-0.450)} = 0.455
\]  

Thus, the final ice fraction is:  
\[
x_2 = 0.455
\]
