TASK 3a  
The gas constant \( R_g \) is calculated as:  
\[
R_g = \frac{R}{M_g} = 166.289 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]

The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the cylinder is determined using the formula for the area of a circle:  
\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \frac{D^2}{4} = \pi \frac{(10 \, \text{cm})^2}{4} = 78.5398 \, \text{cm}^2 = 78.5398 \cdot 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2
\]

The force equilibrium equation is given as:  
\[
(m_{\text{EW}} + m_K) g + p_0 A = p_{g,1} A
\]

Rearranging for \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{(m_{\text{EW}} + m_K) g}{A} + p_0 = \frac{32.1 \cdot 9.81}{A} + 1 \, \text{bar} = 1.40094 \, \text{bar}
\]

The ideal gas law is applied:  
\[
p_{g,1} V_{g,1} = m_g R T_{g,1}
\]

Rearranging for \( m_g \):  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} = 3.4215 \, \text{g}
\]

TASK 3b  
The temperature in state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},1} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]

It is stated that thermal equilibrium is established in state 2:  
"Thermal equilibrium is present in state 2."

The pressure in state 2 is given as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.40094 \, \text{bar}
\]

It is stated that force equilibrium continues to exist:  
"Force equilibrium continues to exist."
