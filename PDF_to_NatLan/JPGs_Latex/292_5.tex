TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn showing the freeze-drying process on a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents pressure (\( p \)) in bar.  
- The horizontal axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in degrees Celsius.  

The graph includes the following features:  
- A curve labeled "Triple" indicating the triple point of water.  
- Several processes are marked:  
  - State 1 is labeled as "isobar."  
  - State 2 is labeled as "isobar."  
  - A transition between states 1 and 2 is shown.  
  - State 5 is marked near the triple point.  

TASK 4b  
The refrigerant mass flow rate is denoted as \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \).  

TASK 4c  
The vapor quality (\( x_1 \)) is defined as:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{p - p_K}{p_g - p_K} = 
\]  
(The equation is incomplete, and no numerical values are provided.)  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance (\( \epsilon_K \)) is expressed as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{24}}{\dot{W}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{24}}{\dot{Q}_{2ab} + |\dot{Q}_{24}|} = \frac{28 \, \text{W}}{\dot{Q}_K - \dot{Q}_{ab}}
\]  
Additionally, the equation includes:  
\[
\frac{28 \, \text{W}}{(u_1 - u_2)(h_{fg} - h_1)}
\]  
(The equation is incomplete, and no numerical values are provided.)
