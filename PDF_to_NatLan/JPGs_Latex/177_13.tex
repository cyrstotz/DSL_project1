TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated under the assumption that the throttling process is isenthalpic, with no work done and adiabatic conditions.  

The pressure at state 1 is \( p_1 = p_{\text{bar}} \).  
The enthalpy at state 1 is given as:  
\[
h_1 = h_u = h_f(p_{\text{bar}}) = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
The enthalpy at state 1 can also be expressed as:  
\[
h_1 = h_f + x(h_g - h_f) \quad \text{at } T_1
\]  
Solving for \( x \):  
\[
x = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = \frac{93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 27.72 \, \text{kJ/kg}}{234.08 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 27.72 \, \text{kJ/kg}}
\]  
\[
x = 0.337
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{2 \dot{W}}
\]  

The heat transfer rate is given by:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}} = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2)
\]  
where \( h_1 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) and \( h_2 = h_f(-22^\circ\text{C}) \).

The temperature would remain constant at \( T_i \) under the given conditions.
