TASK {last_known_task}

The following calculations are presented:

1. \( u_A = -20.00928 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)

2. \( u_A + Q_{A2} = -2109.51 \, \text{J} \)

3. \( u_2 = \frac{u_A + Q_{A2}}{m} = \frac{-2109.51}{1.4} \, \text{kJ/kg} \)

4. The steam quality \( x_2 \) is calculated as:
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_{f,\text{sat}}}{u_{fg,\text{sat}}} = \frac{0.63250}{0.683} = 0.633
   \]

5. Additional values are provided:
   - \( u_{2,f,\text{sat}} = -0.3322 - 333.4422 \, \text{J/kg} \)
   - \( u_{2,fg,\text{sat}} = -0.03362 \, \text{J/kg} \)
