TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{32 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2}{\pi \cdot (0.1 \, \text{m})^2} + \frac{0.1 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2}{\pi \cdot (0.1 \, \text{m})^2}
\]  

The intermediate steps involve calculating the gas mass \( m_g \) using the ideal gas law:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_g \cdot V}{R \cdot T}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} \cdot V_{g,1}}{R \cdot T_{g,1}}
\]  
The gas constant \( R \) is determined as:  
\[
R = \frac{R_u}{M_g} = \frac{8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}}{50 \, \text{kg/kmol}} = 166.28 \, \text{J/kg·K}
\]  
The temperature \( T_{g,1} \) is converted to Kelvin:  
\[
T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} + 273.15 = 773.15 \, \text{K}
\]  

The calculated values are:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}, \quad m_g = 0.003242 \, \text{kg}, \quad m_{\text{total}} = 3.92 \, \text{kg}
\]

TASK 3c  
For a closed system, the energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = 0
\]  

---

TASK 3d  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{Q} - \dot{W}_{\text{out}} = 0
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
dU = Q_{12}
\]  
The change in internal energy is calculated using:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_1 = -333.458 + 0.6 \cdot (-0.005 \cdot -333.458) = -133.426
\]  
The final internal energy is given by:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q_{12}}{m}
\]  

The note "kann sich nicht verschieben" translates to "cannot shift/move."
