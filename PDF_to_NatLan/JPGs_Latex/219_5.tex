TASK 3c  
The first law of thermodynamics for the gas is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U - Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1) + W_{v,1 \to 2}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
-0.80333 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The work done during the volume change is given by:  
\[
W_{v,1 \to 2} = m_g R T_2 \rho_3 \, \text{d}v - \rho_3 (V_2 - V_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
W_{v,1 \to 2} = -211.2 \, \text{J}
\]  

The heat transfer is then calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1015.2 \, \text{J}
\]  

The final volume \( V_2 \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m_g R T_2}{\rho_3}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
V_2 = 0.0011031 \, \text{m}^3 = 1.1032 \, \text{L}
\]

TASK 3d  
The first law of thermodynamics for the ice-water mixture (EW) is expressed as:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  

The internal energy at state 1 is calculated using:  
\[
u_1 = u_f + x_1 (u_s - u_f)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_1 = -200.03 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(from Table 1)}
\]  

The internal energy at state 2 is calculated using:  
\[
u_2 = Q_{12} + u_1 = u_f + x_2 (u_s - u_f)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = -183.94 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(from Table 2)}
\]  

The ice fraction at state 2 is determined as:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_s - u_f}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_2 = 0.5638
\]
