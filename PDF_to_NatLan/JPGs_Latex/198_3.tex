The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 S_2 - m_1 S_1 + \Delta m_{12} S_{12}
\]

The entropy values are determined as follows:  

1. \( S_2 = S_f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 0.195 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \) (from Table A2).  

2. \( S_1 = S_f + x_D(S_g - S_f) \):  
   \[
   S_1 = 1.3337 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
   \]  
   Values are taken from Table A2 at \( 100^\circ\text{C} \).  

3. \( S_{12} = S_f(20^\circ\text{C}) = 0.2966 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \) (from Table A2).  

Finally, the entropy change is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = 130.455 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]
