TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{176 \, \text{kW}}{28 \, \text{W}} = 6285.7
\]

TASK 4e  
It is explained that if the cooling cycle continues with constant heat removal, the sublimation process will slow down. This is because the heat being removed will cause the substance to transition into the gas phase.
