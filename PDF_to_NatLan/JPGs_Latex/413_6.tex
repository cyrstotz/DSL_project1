TASK 2d  
The exergy balance for the aircraft engine is described as follows:  

The system is adiabatic, with \( W_T = 0 \), and operates under steady-state flow conditions.  

\[
\dot{E}_{\text{ex,out}} = \text{in} \, (\Delta \dot{E}_{\text{ex,str}})
\]

The exergy destruction rate is given as:  

\[
\dot{e}_{\text{ex,out}} = \dot{e}_{\text{ex,str}} = 100 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
