TASK 2c  
The equation for exergy is given as:  
\[
o = h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + A_{\text{he}}
\]  

TASK 2d  
The exergy destruction is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{rel}} = \Delta ex_{\text{str}}
\]  
It is further calculated as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{rel}} = \Delta ex_{\text{str}} = 100 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
