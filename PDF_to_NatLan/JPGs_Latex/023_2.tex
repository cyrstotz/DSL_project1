The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is being calculated.  

The formula for entropy change is given as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m \cdot (s_2 - s_1) = \frac{Q}{T} + S_{\text{ex}}
\]  

The entropy values for states 1 and 2 are calculated as follows:  
\[
s_2 = s_f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 0.5839 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  
\[
s_1 = s_f(100^\circ\text{C}) = 1.3069 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

\( S_{\text{ex}} \) is left undefined in the solution.
