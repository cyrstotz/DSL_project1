TASK 1a  
The term "Wärme" is written, which translates to "heat."

---

TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{HF}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
T_{\text{HF}} = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{\ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)} = 293.12
\]  
This is derived from the entropy-temperature relationship (\( \int T \, dS \)) and references \( s_a \) and \( s_e \).

---

TASK 1c  
The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is related to irreversible work, but the equation is incomplete.

---

TASK 1d  
The system is described as "stationär," which translates to "steady-state."

---

TASK 1e  
The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is given by:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m \left(s_2 - s_1\right)
\]
