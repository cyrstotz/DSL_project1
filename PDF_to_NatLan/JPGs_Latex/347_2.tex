TASK 2a  
The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- The horizontal axis is entropy (\( s \)) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  

Key features of the diagram:  
- State points are labeled as \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \).  
- The process begins at state \( 0 \), representing ambient conditions.  
- The compression process from \( 0 \) to \( 1 \) is shown as an upward curve, with the note \( \eta < 1 \), indicating non-ideal compression.  
- The isobaric heat addition process from \( 1 \) to \( 2 \) is depicted as a vertical line.  
- The turbine expansion process from \( 2 \) to \( 4 \) is shown as a downward curve.  
- The mixing process from \( 4 \) to \( 5 \) and the nozzle expansion from \( 5 \) to \( 6 \) are also illustrated.  
- Dashed lines represent isobars, with \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_5 \) labeled.
