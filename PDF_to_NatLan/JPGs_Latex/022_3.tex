TASK 2a  
The entropy difference between states 5 and 6 is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
s_6 - s_5 = s^0(T_6) - s^0(T_5) - R \ln\left(\frac{p_6}{p_5}\right)
\]  
where:  
- \( s^0(T) \) is the standard entropy at temperature \( T \),  
- \( R = c_p - c_v = 0.2874 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \),  
- \( c_p = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \),  
- \( c_v = 0.7186 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \).  

The standard entropy values are interpolated from Table A-22:  
\[
s^0(T_5) = s^0(431.9 \, \text{K}) = 1.79331 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  
\[
s^0(T_6) = s^0(336.9 \, \text{K}) = \text{interpolated value from A-22}
\]  

Interpolation is performed as follows:  
\[
T_6 = 340 - 330 \quad \text{(temperature range for interpolation)}
\]  
\[
s^0(T_6) = \left(\frac{1.79327 - 1.78249}{340 - 330}\right) \cdot (336.9 - 330) + 1.78249
\]  
\[
s^0(T_6) = 1.78249 + \text{interpolated increment} = 1.78249 + 0.01084 = 1.79333 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

Substituting into the entropy difference formula:  
\[
s_6 - s_5 = 1.79333 - 1.79331 - 0.2874 \ln\left(\frac{0.5}{0.191}\right)
\]  
\[
s_6 - s_5 = -0.00002 - 0.2874 \cdot 0.916 = -0.2633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

TASK 2b  
The work done by the turbine is expressed as:  
\[
w_t = -\int_5^6 p \, dV
\]  
where \( p \) is the pressure and \( V \) is the specific volume.  

The relationship between pressure and volume is given by:  
\[
p = p_5 \left(\frac{V_5}{V}\right)^\kappa
\]  
where \( \kappa = \frac{c_p}{c_v} \).  

The integral for work is then:  
\[
w_t = -\int_5^6 p_5 \left(\frac{V_5}{V}\right)^\kappa \, dV
\]  

Further simplifications or numerical integration may be required to compute the exact value.
