TASK 1c  
The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is given as:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = 298 \, \text{K}
\]  
The entropy balance equation is expressed as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( s_e - s_a \right) + \sum \frac{\dot{Q}_j}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
The entropy generation rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = -\dot{m} \left( s_e - s_a \right) - \sum \frac{\dot{Q}_j}{T}
\]

TASK 1d  
The energy balance equation for the system is written as:  
\[
\Delta m \left[ h \right] + Q - W + \sum \dot{m} \left( h \right) = \Delta U + \frac{1}{2} \Delta KE + \Delta PE
\]  
Here, kinetic energy (\( \Delta KE \)) and potential energy (\( \Delta PE \)) are considered negligible, simplifying the equation.

TASK 1e  
The entropy change of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is given as:  
\[
\Delta S = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1
\]  
The mass at state 2 is expressed as:  
\[
m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12}
\]
