TASK 1d  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{E}_f = \sum \dot{m} \left[ h_i + ke_i + pe_i \right] + \sum \dot{Q}_i - \sum \dot{W}_n
\]  
where \( h_i \) represents enthalpy, \( ke_i \) is kinetic energy, \( pe_i \) is potential energy, \( \dot{Q}_i \) is heat transfer, and \( \dot{W}_n \) is work transfer.  

The heat transfer rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \left[ h_a - h_e \right] = \dot{m} \left[ \ldots \right]
\]  

TASK 1e  
The entropy change is given by:  
\[
\Delta S = m \left( s_2 - s_1 \right)
\]
