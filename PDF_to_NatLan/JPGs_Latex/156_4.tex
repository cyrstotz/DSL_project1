TASK 3a  
The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) of the gas in state 1 are determined using the following equations:  

\[
(m_K + m_{\text{EW}}) g + p_{\text{amb}} A = p_{g,1} A
\]

The area \( A \) is calculated as:  
\[
A = \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2 \pi - \frac{\pi}{400}
\]

Substituting values, the pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is found to be:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{(m_K + m_{\text{EW}}) g}{A} + p_{\text{amb}} = 1.401 \, \text{bar}
\]

The ideal gas law is used to calculate the mass \( m_g \):  
\[
p_{g,1} V_{g,1} = m_g R T_{g,1}
\]

The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g} = \frac{166.28}{50} = 3.3256 \, \text{J/(gÂ·K)}
\]

Rearranging for \( m_g \):  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}}
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
m_g = \frac{1.401 \cdot 3.14}{3.3256 \cdot 773.15} = 3.427 \, \text{g}
\]

TASK 3b  
The ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \).  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined as follows:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]

This is because the water is incompressible, and the melting ice leads to no change in volume. Thus, the EW system is isochoric, and the equation from part (a) remains valid for part (b).  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is calculated using the polytropic process relation:  
\[
\frac{T_{g,2}}{T_{g,1}} = \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{n-1}
\]

Rewriting:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \cdot \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{n-1}
\]

The pressure-volume relationship is given by:  
\[
p_{g,2} V_{g,2} = m_g R T_{g,2}
\]

Rearranging for \( V_{g,2} \):  
\[
V_{g,2} = \frac{m_g R T_{g,2}}{p_{g,2}}
\]

From (1) to (2):  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \cdot \frac{M_g R T_{g,2}}{p_{g,2} V_{g,1}}
\]  

The equations are set up for further calculation.
