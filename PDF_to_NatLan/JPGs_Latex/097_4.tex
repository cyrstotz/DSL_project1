TASK 2a  
The task involves creating a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process.  

### Diagram Description:  
The diagram is a \( T \)-\( s \) (temperature vs. entropy) plot with the following features:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin \([K]\).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \) in \([kJ/kgÂ·K]\).  
- Several states are labeled:  
  - **State 1**: Located at the bottom left, representing ambient conditions (\( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} \) or \( 243.15 \, \text{K} \), \( p_0 \)).  
  - **State 2**: A vertical line upward from State 1, indicating adiabatic compression (\( s = \text{const} \)).  
  - **State 3**: A horizontal line to the right from State 2, representing isobaric heat addition (\( p = \text{const} \), \( T = 1289 \, \text{K} \)).  
  - **State 4**: A downward sloping line from State 3, indicating adiabatic expansion (\( s = \text{const} \)).  
  - **State 5**: A horizontal line to the left from State 4, representing mixing at constant pressure (\( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \)).  
  - **State 6**: A wavy line downward from State 5, representing nozzle expansion (\( s = \text{const} \), \( p_6 = p_0 \)).  

### Additional Notes:  
- The diagram includes dashed lines for constant pressures (\( p_0 \), \( p_5 \)).  
- The text mentions "Loft ideales Gas" (ideal gas assumption) and "kein 'Schock'" (no shock).
