TASK 3c  
The system is stationary, so the energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ s_2 - s_1 \right] + 2 \dot{Q} + \dot{m} s_{\text{oz}}
\]  
The entropy flow rate of the gas is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{s}_{\text{oz}} = \frac{65000 \, \text{W}}{255 \, \text{K}} = 220.3 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{KÂ·s}}
\]

TASK 3d  
The change in energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \sum m_i h_i + \sum Q - \sum W
\]  
Rewriting the equation:  
\[
m_2 u_2 - m_{\text{gas}} u_1 = \sum \Delta m_i h_i - Q
\]  

Values provided:  
\[
h_1 = 252.88
\]  
\[
u_2 = 252.85
\]  
\[
u_1 = 418.94 + 0.005 \left( 2506.5 - 918.59 \right) = 925.377
\]
