TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \):  
The temperature \( T_i \) is fully determined at \( p = 8 \, \text{bar} \), yielding \( T_i = 37.33^\circ\text{C} \).  
The throttling process is isothermal.

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is given by:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{|\dot{Q}_K|}{|\dot{W}_K|}
\]

---

TASK 4e  
The temperature would eventually stabilize when the refrigerant can no longer absorb heat, meaning \( T_i = T_s \).
