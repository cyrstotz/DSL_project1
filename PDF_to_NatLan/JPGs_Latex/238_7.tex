TASK 3c  
The energy balance equation for a steady-state flow process is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m} \left[ h + \frac{v^2}{2} + pe \right] + \sum \dot{Q}_j - \sum \dot{W}_n
\]  
where \( h \) is the specific enthalpy, \( v^2/2 \) is the kinetic energy per unit mass, \( pe \) is the potential energy per unit mass, \( \dot{Q}_j \) represents heat transfer rates, and \( \dot{W}_n \) represents work rates.  

For the heat transfer calculation:  
\[
Q_R = m \left[ h_2 - h_1 \right]
\]  
where \( h_2 \) and \( h_1 \) are the specific enthalpies at states 2 and 1, respectively, and \( m \) is the mass flow rate.
