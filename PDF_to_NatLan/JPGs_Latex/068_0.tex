TASK 1a  
The energy balance equation for the reactor is written as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} h_{\text{in}} - \dot{m}_{\text{out}} h_{\text{out}} + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{Q}_{\text{acc}}
\]  
Here, the system is in steady-state, so \(\dot{Q}_{\text{acc}} = 0\).  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (h_{\text{out}} - h_{\text{in}}) + \dot{Q}_R
\]  

The fluid is saturated liquid at both inlet and outlet. The steam quality \(x\) is zero at both points.  

From the water tables:  
\[
h_{\text{in}} = h_f(T_{\text{in}} = 70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.98 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
\[
h_{\text{out}} = h_f(T_{\text{out}} = 100^\circ\text{C}) = 419.04 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \cdot (419.04 - 292.98) \, \text{kJ/kg} + 100 \, \text{kW}
\]  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 62.432 \, \text{kW}
\]  

TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is given by:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_{T_{\text{KF,in}}}^{T_{\text{KF,out}}} T \, dS}{S_{\text{out}} - S_{\text{in}}}
\]  

The equation is set up but not solved further on this page.
