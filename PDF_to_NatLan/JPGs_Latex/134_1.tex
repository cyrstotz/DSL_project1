TASK 1e  
The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated as follows:  

\[
\Delta S_{12} = \Delta m_{12} \cdot s_{\text{in}} + \frac{Q_{R,12}}{T}
\]

Substituting the given values:  

\[
\Delta S_{12} = \Delta m_{12} \cdot s_{\text{in}} + \frac{35{,}000}{T}
\]
