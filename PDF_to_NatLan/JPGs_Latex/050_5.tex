TASK 3a  
The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) are calculated as follows:  

The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is determined using the equation:  
\[
p_{g,1} \cdot A = m_g \cdot g + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot g + p_{\text{amb}} \cdot A
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{1}{A} \left( m_g \cdot g + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot g \right) + p_{\text{amb}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
A = \pi \cdot (0.1)^2 \quad \text{(area of the cylinder cross-section)}  
\]  
\[
p_{\text{amb}} = 100,000 \, \text{N/m}^2  
\]  
\[
p_{g,1} = 110,023.6 \, \text{N/m}^2  
\]  

The mass \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
m = \frac{p \cdot V}{R \cdot T}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T = 273.15 \, \text{K}  
\]  
\[
R = \frac{8.314}{50} = 0.16628 \, \text{kJ/(kg·K)} = 166.28 \, \text{J/(kg·K)}  
\]  
\[
V = 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3  
\]  
\[
m = 0.0027 \, \text{kg}  
\]

TASK 3b  
The final state is described as \( T_g = T_{\text{EW}} \), meaning the gas and the ice-water mixture reach thermal equilibrium.  

The system is balanced, and the process is isothermal at \( T_a = 0.003^\circ \text{C} \).  

The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q  
\]  
where \( u_2 \) and \( u_1 \) are specific internal energies.  

A small sketch is included, showing a box labeled \( Q_{12} \), with arrows indicating heat transfer.  

The text mentions "Pkompressibel = Pisochor," suggesting incompressible behavior or constant volume.

TASK 3c  
The ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated at \( T_{\text{WZ}} = 0.003^\circ \text{C} \).  

The heat transfer \( Q \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q = m_g \cdot (u_{12} - u_{1}) + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (u_{2} - u_{1})
\]  
Expanding the equation:  
\[
Q = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot c \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
Q = 0.0027 \cdot 0.633 \cdot (273.153 - 273.15) + 0.1 \cdot c \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

A small diagram is included, showing a cross-section of the system with arrows indicating heat flow.
