TASK 2c  
The task involves determining the mass-specific increase in flow exergy (\( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \)).

The equation for the mass-specific exergy destruction is written as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \left( h_0 - h_6 + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2} \right) + \sum \dot{Q} + \dot{W}_t = 0
\]  
where \( \dot{W}_t \) is the turbine work.  

The turbine work is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{W}_t = \frac{\dot{Q}}{\dot{m}} + \Delta ex_e
\]  
and further simplified:  
\[
\dot{W}_t = -n \int p \, dv + ex_e = -n \left( \frac{R(T_6 - T_0)}{1 - n} \right) + \frac{1}{2} \dot{m} (w_0^2 - w_6^2)
\]

The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is given as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \left( h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \Delta ex_e + \Delta p^e \right) = \Delta ex_{\text{flow}}
\]

TASK 2d  
The task involves calculating the exergy destruction (\( ex_{\text{dest}} \)) in the engine.

The exergy destruction is expressed as:  
\[
ex_{\text{val}} = T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{ex}}
\]  

The entropy production rate is given as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{ex}} = \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} (s_6 - s_0) = \frac{\dot{Q}}{T}
\]  

This equation accounts for the heat transfer and entropy generation in the system.
