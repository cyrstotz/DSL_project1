TASK 1c  
Entropy is generated at the wall during heat transfer.  

The system is steady-state, meaning \( \frac{dS}{dt} = 0 \).  

The entropy balance equation is:  
\[
\dot{S} = \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
Rearranging for entropy generation:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = -\frac{\dot{Q}}{T_{\text{KF}}}
\]  

Given:  
\[
\dot{Q} = -\dot{Q}_R + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = -100 + 62.182 = 37.818 \, \text{kW}
\]  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{37.818}{293.12} = 0.129 \, \text{kW/K}
\]  

A diagram is included showing heat flows \( \dot{Q}_R \) and \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) through the reactor wall to the coolant, labeled with arrows. The coolant temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} = 293.12 \, \text{K} \) is noted.

TASK 1d  
The reactor operates in a semi-open system. The mass balance equation is:  
\[
m_{12} = m_{11} - \Delta m_{12} h_{12}
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_{12} - m_{11}}{h_{12}}
\]  

Given:  
\[
m_{11} = 5755 \, \text{kg}
\]  
\[
m_{12} = m_{11} + \Delta m_{12}
\]  

Specific enthalpies:  
\[
h_{12} = h_2(70^\circ\text{C}) = 932.98 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
\[
h_{11} = h_1(100^\circ\text{C}) \cdot 0.005 = 0.005 \cdot 2676.1 = 13.38 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
\[
h_{12} = h_2(20^\circ\text{C}) = 63.96 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Calculating \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_{11} \cdot h_{11} + m_{12} \cdot h_{12} - m_{11} \cdot h_{12}}{h_{12}}
\]  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = 3781.563 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The final result is boxed:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = 3781.563 \, \text{kg}
\]
