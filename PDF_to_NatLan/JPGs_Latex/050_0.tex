TASK 1a  
The heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) removed by the coolant is calculated using the energy balance equation:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = 0 = \dot{m} (h_{\text{zw}} - h_{\text{aw}}) + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  
where \( h_{\text{aw}} \) corresponds to the enthalpy at \( 70^\circ\text{C} \) (saturated liquid, \( x = 1 \)) and \( h_{\text{zw}} \) corresponds to the enthalpy at \( 100^\circ\text{C} \) (saturated liquid, \( x = 1 \)).  

The heat flow is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} (h_{\text{zw}} - h_{\text{aw}})
\]  

Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. A schematic of the reactor showing inlet and outlet streams labeled \( h_{\text{aw}} \), \( h_{\text{zw}} \), and the heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) removed by the coolant.  
2. A simplified representation of the reactor with arrows indicating the flow directions and heat transfer.

TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) of the coolant is calculated using the logarithmic mean temperature difference formula:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\Delta T_{\text{ds}}}{\Delta s_{\text{a} - \text{e}}} = \frac{h_{\text{a}} - h_{\text{e}}}{s_{\text{a}} - s_{\text{e}}} = \frac{T_a - T_e}{\ln \left( \frac{T_a}{T_e} \right)}
\]  
Substituting values, \( T_{\text{KF}} = 293.12 \, \text{K} \).

TASK 1c  
The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) from heat transfer between the reactor and the cooling jacket is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{zw}}} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{aw}}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{323.15 \, \text{K}} - \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{293.12 \, \text{K}} = 0.047 \, \text{kW/K} = 47.72 \, \text{W/K}
\]  

A diagram is drawn showing the reactor with labeled temperatures \( 293.12 \, \text{K} \) and \( 100^\circ\text{C} \), and entropy flows.

TASK 1d  
The mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) required to reduce the reactor temperature from \( 100^\circ\text{C} \) to \( 70^\circ\text{C} \) is calculated using an energy balance:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = 70^\circ\text{C}, \quad T_{\text{in,12}} = 20^\circ\text{C}, \quad \Delta m_{12} > 0
\]  
Energy balance:  
\[
m_2 u_2 - m_{\text{in}} u_{\text{in}} - \Delta m h_{\text{sp}} = Q
\]  
Rewritten as:  
\[
(m + \Delta m) u_2 - m_{\text{in}} u_{\text{in}} - \Delta m h_{\text{sp}} = Q
\]  
The mass \( m_2 \) is expressed as:  
\[
m_2 = m + \Delta m
\]  

No further numerical solution is provided.

Descriptions of diagrams:  
- Multiple diagrams are drawn showing the reactor, inlet and outlet streams, and labeled enthalpy and temperature values.
