TASK 4a  
A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn, showing the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and phase regions.  
- Point 3 is marked at 8 bar, representing the high-pressure state after compression.  
- Point 2 is located on the curve, representing the isobaric evaporation process.  
- The diagram includes annotations for "isotrope" and "isobar" to indicate the thermodynamic paths.  
- The x-axis is labeled as temperature (\( T \)), and the y-axis is labeled as pressure (\( p \)).  

TASK 4b  
The mass flow rate of the refrigerant (\( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \)) is calculated using the energy balance in the compressor:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_e - h_a) - \dot{W}_K
\]  
Rearranging for \( \dot{m} \):  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_e - h_a}
\]  
Given:  
\[
\dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{W}
\]  

Additional notes:  
- \( \dot{W}_K = 25 \, \text{W} \) is mentioned separately.  
- \( h_e \) and \( h_a \) are to be obtained from Table A-11.  
- \( h_e \) is left undefined in the transcription.
