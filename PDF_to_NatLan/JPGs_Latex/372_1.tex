TASK 4c  
The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{l}
\]  
where \( l \) represents the specific latent heat.  

The temperature at state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is to be determined.  

The entropy at state 1 is expressed as:  
\[
s_1 = s_{g,1} = s_{l,1,f}
\]  

The pressure at state 1 is:  
\[
p_1 = 5 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Using the entropy data for \( s_{l,1,f} \) at \( 5 \, \text{bar} \):  
\[
s_{l,1,f}(5 \, \text{bar}) = 0.3455 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  

From Table A-11, the entropy difference is calculated:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{s_1 - s_{l,1,f}}{s_{g,1} - s_{l,1,f}}
\]  

The heat transfer rate is expressed as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_{g,1} - h_{l,1})
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance (\( \epsilon_K \)) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  

The heat transfer rate between states 3 and 4 is given as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_{g,3} - h_{l,3}) - \dot{Q}_{\text{ab}}
\]  

The enthalpy difference is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{ab}} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_{g,3} - h_{l,3})
\]  

From Table A-11, the enthalpy values are:  
\[
h_{g,3} = h_{l,3} + x_3 \cdot (h_{g,3} - h_{l,3})
\]  
where \( x_3 \) is the vapor quality at \( 5 \, \text{bar} \).  

The vapor quality \( x_3 \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_3 = \frac{s_3 - s_{l,3,f}}{s_{g,3} - s_{l,3,f}}
\]  

The enthalpy at state 3 is determined using:  
\[
h_{g,3} = h_{l,3,f} + x_3 \cdot (h_{g,3} - h_{l,3,f}) \quad \text{(at \( 5 \, \text{bar} \))}
\]
