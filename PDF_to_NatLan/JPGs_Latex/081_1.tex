TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn with the temperature \( T \) (in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and entropy \( s \) on the horizontal axis. The graph appears to be a qualitative representation of a thermodynamic process, with a flat line indicating constant temperature or entropy.

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} \, e_{\text{ex},\text{str}} = \dot{m} \left[ h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) \right]
\]

TASK 2d  
Two equations are provided:  
1. The exergy destruction rate:  
\[
\dot{E}_{\text{ex,d}} = T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]

2. The mass-specific exergy destruction:  
\[
\dot{e}_{\text{ex,d}} = \frac{T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}}{\dot{m}_{\text{g}}}
\]
