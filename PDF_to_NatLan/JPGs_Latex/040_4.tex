TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated as:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + p_{\text{EW}} + p_{\text{MK}}
\]  
Where:  
\[
p_{\text{EW}} = \frac{m_{\text{EW}} g}{\pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2}, \quad p_{\text{MK}} = \frac{m_{\text{MK}} g}{\pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1 \, \text{bar} + 127.91 \, \text{Pa} + 39969 \, \text{Pa}
\]  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1.19 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas mass \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,1} V_{g,1} = m_g R T_{g,1}, \quad R = \frac{R_u}{M}
\]  
Where:  
\[
R_u = 8.314 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{mol·K}}, \quad M = 50 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{kmol}}
\]  
\[
R = 166.28 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} = 0.00392 \, \text{kg}
\]  
\[
m_g = 3.92 \, \text{g}
\]

TASK 3b  
Given \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), the gas temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined.  

At state 2:  
Thermal equilibrium exists between the ice-water mixture (EW) and the gas, meaning no heat flow occurs. Therefore, the temperatures are equal:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is left undefined in the visible content.  

No further calculations or explanations are provided.
