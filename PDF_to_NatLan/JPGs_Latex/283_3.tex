TASK 3d

Referring to the equilibrium water (EW) table, the calculation for \( x \) is as follows:

\[
x = \frac{-185.09 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + 0.033 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}}{-333.492 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + 0.033 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}}
\]

Simplifying the expression:

\[
x = 0.555
\]

This value is boxed as the final result.
