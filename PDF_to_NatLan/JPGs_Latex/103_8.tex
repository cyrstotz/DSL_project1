TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) in state 1 are calculated as follows:  

The ideal gas law is used:  
\[
p_1 V = m_g R T
\]  
where \( R \) is the specific gas constant, calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g} = \frac{8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}}{50 \, \text{kg/kmol}} = 0.166 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

To determine \( p_{g,1} \), equilibrium is considered:  
\[
p_{\text{amb}} A + m_K g = p_{g,1} A
\]  
The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the cylinder is:  
\[
A = \pi \left( 0.1 \, \text{m} \right)^2 = 0.0314 \, \text{m}^2
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 10^5 \, \text{Pa} + \frac{32 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2}{0.0314 \, \text{m}^2} = 1.1 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas mass \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_1 V}{R T_1} = \frac{1.09 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \cdot 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3}{0.166 \cdot 10^3 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K}} = 2.77 \, \text{g}
\]

TASK 3c  
The transferred heat \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture (EW) is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
m \left( u_{2g} - u_{1g} \right) + Q_{12} = 0
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_V \left( T_{g,2} - T_{g,1} \right)
\]  
where \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \).  

Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 0.02777 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \cdot \left( -499.997 \, \text{K} \right) = -7.21 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

Thus, the heat transferred from the gas to the EW is:  
\[
Q_{12} = 7.21 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

Description: Heat flows from the gas to the ice-water mixture (EW).
