TASK 4b  
The refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is calculated using the energy balance equation for the evaporator:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{h_e - h_a}
\]  
where \( \dot{W}_k = 28 \, \text{W} \), \( h_e \) is the enthalpy at the evaporator outlet, and \( h_a \) is the enthalpy at the evaporator inlet.

TASK 4c  
The temperature \( T_i \) is given as \( -20^\circ\text{C} \).  
The temperature of evaporation is calculated as \( T_{\text{evap}} = -26^\circ\text{C} = 247.15 \, \text{K} \).

The main energy balance for the evaporator is expressed as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}(h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_k
\]

---

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_k \) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_k = \frac{\dot{Q}_k}{\dot{W}_k}
\]  
This represents the ratio of the heat removed by the evaporator to the work input to the compressor.
