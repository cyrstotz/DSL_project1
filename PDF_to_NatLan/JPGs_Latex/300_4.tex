TASK 2a  
The mass flow rate is constant:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{in}} = \rho_5 A_5 w_5 = \rho_6 A_6 w_6 \quad \rightarrow \quad A_5 = A_6 \quad \text{(assumption, no further idea provided)}
\]  

The temperature at state 5 is:  
\[
T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}
\]  

The velocity at state 5 is:  
\[
V_5 = 2.42 \, \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The temperature at state 6 is:  
\[
T_6 = 322.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

The velocity at state 6 is:  
\[
V_6 = 4.93717 \, \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated using:  
\[
w_6 = \frac{p_5}{\rho_6} w_5
\]  
or alternatively:  
\[
w_6 = \frac{V_6}{V_5} w_5
\]  

The final outlet velocity is:  
\[
w_6 = 437.49 \, \text{m/s}
\]
