TASK 3a  
The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is calculated as:  
\[
A = \pi \frac{D^2}{4} = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  

The pressure in state 1 is given by:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{m_{\text{EW}} g}{A} + \frac{m_K g}{A} + p_{\text{amb}} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The mass of the gas in state 1 is determined using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,1} V_{g,1} = m_g R T_{g,1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1} M_g}{R T_{g,1}} = 0.108 \, \text{kg}
\]

TASK 3b  
The volume of the EW in state 2 is given as:  
\[
V_{\text{EW},2} = V_{\text{EW},1}
\]  

The pressure in state 2 remains constant:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

It is stated that \( m_{\text{EW}} \), \( m_K \), and \( p_{\text{amb}} \) do not change.  

The temperature in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
T_{g,2} = \frac{p_{g,2} V_{g,2} M_g}{m_g R}
\]

TASK 3c  
The heat transferred from the gas to the EW is calculated as:  
\[
m_g (u_{g,2} - u_{g,1}) = \dot{Q} = -1.139 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The internal energy change is expressed as:  
\[
u_{g,2} - u_{g,1} = c_V (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1})
\]

TASK 3d  
The mass of the EW in state 2 is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
m_{\text{EW},2} (u_{\text{EW},2} - u_{\text{EW},1}) = \dot{Q}
\]  

The internal energy of the EW is expressed as:  
\[
u_{\text{EW},2} = u_{\text{EW},1} + x_2 (u_{\text{ice},2} - u_{\text{water},2})
\]  

The heat transfer is given as:  
\[
\dot{Q} = m_{\text{EW},2} (u_{\text{EW},2} - u_{\text{EW},1}) + x_2 (u_{\text{ice},2} - u_{\text{water},2})
\]  

The ice fraction in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{\dot{Q}}{m_{\text{EW},2} (u_{\text{ice},2} - u_{\text{water},2})}
\]  

The pressure in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_K g}{A} + \frac{m_{\text{EW},2} g}{A} = 2.9 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The ice fraction is determined as:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{-0.332 + 0.079}{(2.9 - 2) - 0.079} = -0.106 \, \text{kg}
\]
