TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x = \frac{h - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{|\dot{Q}_K|}{|\dot{W}_K|} = \frac{|\dot{Q}_K|}{|\dot{Q}_{41}| - |\dot{Q}_K|}
\]  

TASK 4e  
The air would transition from a gaseous state to a solid state, forming ice.
