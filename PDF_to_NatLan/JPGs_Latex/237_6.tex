TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
p_{g,1} = m_{\text{EW}} g \frac{1}{A} + m_K g \frac{1}{A} + p_{\text{amb}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas equation of state is used:  
\[
p V = m_g R T
\]  
Rearranging for \( m_g \):  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_g V_g}{R T_g}
\]  
Where:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g} = 0.76628 \, \text{kJ/(kgÂ·K)}
\]  
\[
V_g = 3.14 \, \text{L} = 0.00314 \, \text{m}^3
\]  
\[
T_g = 773.15 \, \text{K}
\]  
Substituting these values:  
\[
m_g = 3.49 \, \text{g}
\]  

The area \( A \) is calculated as:  
\[
A = \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^2 \pi = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]

TASK 3b  
The internal energy \( u_2 \) is equal to \( u_1 \):  
\[
u_2 = u_1
\]  
The pressure remains constant:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{g,2}
\]  
The text notes that "pressure from above remains constant."

TASK 3c  
The entropy change \( \Delta S_g \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S_g = \frac{Q_{12}}{T_{g,2}}
\]  
The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) is calculated using:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1})
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 110.95 \, \text{J}
\]  

The temperatures are:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0.003^\circ \text{C} = 273.153 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
T_{g,1} = 773.15 \, \text{K}
\]

TASK 3d  
The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is equal to \( Q_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta U = Q_{12}
\]  
The internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = u_1 + \frac{Q_{12}}{m}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = -215.14 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Additional calculations:  
\[
Q_{12} = 1500 \, \text{J}
\]  
The equation for \( u_{T} \) is given as:  
\[
u_{T} = u_{0^\circ \text{C}} + k (u_{0^\circ \text{C}} - u_{T})
\]  
Where:  
\[
u_{0^\circ \text{C}} = -200.14 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
