TASK 3c  
The change in internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U_{g,12} = Q - W
\]  
The heat transfer is calculated using:  
\[
Q = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = 10.837 \cdot 70833
\]  

The final volume of the gas is determined using:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m \cdot R \cdot T_2}{p} = 0.00711 \, \text{m}^3
\]  

Substituting values, the heat transfer \( Q \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q = 10.837 + 1.40 \, \text{bar} \cdot (3.14 - 7.11 \, \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{m}^{-3})
\]  
\[
Q = 7367.2 \, \text{J}
\]  

TASK 3d  
The entropy change is represented as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = \int \frac{\delta Q}{T}
\]
