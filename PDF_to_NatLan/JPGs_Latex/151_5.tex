TASK 3c  
The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q_{12} = dU + W
\]  
The work \( W \) is given by:  
\[
W = \int p \, dV = p \, (V_2 - V_1)
\]  
The change in internal energy \( dU \) is left incomplete.

TASK 3d  
The vapor quality \( x_e \) is defined as:  
\[
x_e = \frac{u_2 - u_{\text{frost}}}{u_{\text{frost}} - u_{\text{liquid}}}
\]  
Note: \( u_{\text{frost}} \) is partially crossed out but remains legible.
