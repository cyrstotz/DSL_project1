TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) in state 1 are calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
pV = mRT
\]  
Given:  
- \( T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} \)  
- \( V_{g,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L} \)  
- \( M_g = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol} \)  
- \( R = \frac{8.31}{M_g} = \frac{8.31}{50} = 0.1662 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)  

The calculation for \( p_{g,1} \) appears partially crossed out, but the formula setup is visible:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{mRT}{V}
\]  

TASK 3b  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) in state 2 are noted but not explicitly calculated.  

TASK 3c  
The energy balance is written as:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = E_{\text{Q}} - E_{\text{W}}
\]  
Simplified to:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12}
\]  

TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated using the following relationships:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.003
\]  
The specific internal energy values are given:  
\[
u_{\text{ice}} = -333.447 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad u_{\text{fusion}} = -0.033 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
The total internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
u_{\text{tot}} = u_f + x_{\text{ice}} \left( u_{\text{fusion}} - u_{\text{ice}} \right)
\]
