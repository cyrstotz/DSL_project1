TASK 3b  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,2} \) and temperature \( T_{g,2} \) are determined as follows:  

\[
p_{g,2} = \frac{m_K \cdot g}{A}
\]

Here, \( p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \), as the mass of the piston remains constant and the density of the ice-water mixture does not change.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is given as \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) or \( 273.15 \, \text{K} \), because the system is still in equilibrium with ice present in the water. The water does not warm further since the ice has not completely melted.

TASK 3c  
The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the formula:  

\[
Q_{12} = c_V \cdot m_g \cdot \Delta T
\]

Where:  
\[
Q_{12} = c_V \cdot m_g \cdot (T_1 - T_2)
\]  

This represents the heat exchange between the gas and the ice-water mixture as the system reaches equilibrium.
