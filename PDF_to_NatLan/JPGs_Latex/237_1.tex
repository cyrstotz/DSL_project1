TASK 1d  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta U = \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} + m_{12} U
\]  

The mass \( m_{12} \) is calculated using:  
\[
m_{12} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{U_{12}} = \frac{m_{12} (U_2 - U_1)}{U_{12}}
\]  

The internal energy \( U_1 \) is determined as:  
\[
U_1 = U_f + x \cdot (U_g - U_f)
\]  
where \( x = 0.005 \), \( U_g = 100^\circ \, \text{C} = 40.15 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

For state 2:  
\[
U_{12} = U_f + x \cdot (U_g - U_f) = 2333.33 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The steam quality \( x_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_{12} = \frac{h - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = 0.03
\]  

The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = \dot{m} \cdot \text{(remaining terms not visible)}
\]
