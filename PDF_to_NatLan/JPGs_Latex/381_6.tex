TASK 2c  
The outlet velocity \( w_c \) is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
w_c = \sqrt{2 \, c_p \, (T_5 - T_0) + \frac{w_5^2}{2}}
\]

The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m}_K + \dot{m}_M = \dot{m}_K (1 + 5.293)
\]

The energy balance for the combustion chamber is given as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_K (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{m}_K \cdot q_B
\]

The heat transfer \( q_B \) is described as:  
\[
-q_B = c_p (T_2 - T_3)
\]

The temperature \( T_2 \) is labeled as "some value."

For the turbine, the energy balance is:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_K \, c_p (T_1 - T_2) + Q_{\text{ext}} \, \frac{W_{\text{ext}}}{\dot{m}_K}
\]

TASK 2d  
The change in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_6 - ex_0
\]

The detailed expression for \( ex_6 - ex_0 \) is:  
\[
(n_6 - e_0) - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + p_0 \left( V_6 - V_0 \right)
\]

Breaking this down further:  
\[
= c_p (T_6 - T_0) - T_0 \, c_p \left( \frac{T_c}{T_1} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) + p_0 (V_6 - V_0)
\]

Additional relationships are provided:  
\[
V_0 = \frac{R \, T}{p_0}, \quad V_6 = \frac{R \, T}{p_0}
\]

The gas constant \( R \) is expressed as:  
\[
R = c_p \left( 1 - \frac{1}{r_c} \right)
\]

The heat capacity ratio \( c_v \) is given as:  
\[
c_v = \frac{c_p}{r_c}
\]
