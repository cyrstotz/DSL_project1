TASK 1e  
The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated as follows:

The formula for \( \Delta S_{12} \) is:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1
\]

From the problem setup:  
\[
s_2 = s_f + 0.005 \cdot (s_g - s_f)
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
s_2 = 1.3069 + 0.005 \cdot (7.3549 - 1.3069) = 1.33714
\]

The mass values are:  
\[
m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg}, \quad m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12} = 5755 + 3600 = 9355 \, \text{kg}
\]

Using the formula for \( \Delta S_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = 9355 \cdot 0.9549 - 5755 \cdot 1.33714
\]

Performing the calculations:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = 8933.0895 - 7695.28407 = 1237.85 \, \text{kg·kJ/K}
\]  

The final entropy change is:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = 1237.85 \, \text{kg·kJ/K}
\]
