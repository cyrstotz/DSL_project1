TASK 4a  
The phase diagram is described with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled isobaric and isothermal processes for states 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- State 1: Isobaric and isothermal evaporation.  
- State 2: Isentropic compression.  
- State 3: Isobaric condensation.  
- State 4: Isentropic and isothermal expansion.  

TASK 4b  
The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is calculated using the steady-state energy balance:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(h_e - h_a) + \sum \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}
\]  
Relevant values for entropy and enthalpy are noted:  
- \( s_2 = s_g(6 \, \text{K}) = 0.3459 \)  
- \( s_3 = s_g(31.33^\circ\text{C}) = 0.9066 \)  
- \( h_1 = h(31.33^\circ\text{C}) \)  

TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_A - h_g}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
It is noted that \( T_1 = T_u = 31.33^\circ\text{C} \).  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{zu}}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{zu}}{\dot{Q}_{abl} - \dot{Q}_{zu}}
\]  
Heat flows are expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{zu} = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_1)  
\]  
\[
\dot{Q}_{abl} = \dot{m}(h_A - h_3)  
\]  
Relevant enthalpy values are provided:  
- \( h_1 = h(T_1, p_1) \)  
- \( h_2 = h(T_2, -22^\circ\text{C}) = 236.08 \)  
- \( h_3 = h(8 \, \text{bar}, T_3) \)  
- \( h_u = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 93.42 \)  

No additional diagrams or figures are described beyond the phase diagram in TASK 4a.
