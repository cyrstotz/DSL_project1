TASK 4b  
The initial temperature is given as \( T_1 = -20^\circ\text{C} \). After expansion, the temperature becomes \( T_2 = -16^\circ\text{C} \). The specific entropy at state 2 is \( s_2 = 0.9298 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).  

The specific enthalpy at state 2 is calculated using the saturated vapor enthalpy at \( T_2 = -16^\circ\text{C} \):  
\[
h_2 = h_g(-16^\circ\text{C}) = 237.74 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The specific enthalpy at state 3 is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
h_3 = h(8 \, \text{bar}, 40^\circ\text{C}) - s_2 \cdot (8 \, \text{bar}, 31.33^\circ\text{C}) + h(8 \, \text{bar}, 31.33^\circ\text{C})
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
h_3 \approx 271.31 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The energy balance for the compressor is given as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{-28 \, \text{kW}}{h_2 - h_3} \approx 3 \, \text{kg/h}
\]

The temperature will continue to decrease until the cooling power \( \dot{W}_K \) is no longer sufficient to maintain the heat removal process.
