The temperature ratio is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa}}
\]  
This leads to:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa}} = 328.0747 \, \text{K}
\]  

The entropy at state 5 is equal to the entropy at state 6:  
\[
S_5 = S_6
\]  

The energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right] - \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}}
\]
