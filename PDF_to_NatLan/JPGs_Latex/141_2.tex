TASK 2a  
The page contains a graph labeled as a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are marked as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (K).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  

The graph shows several curves and points:  
1. A curve labeled "0.191 bar" representing an isobaric process at a pressure of 0.191 bar.  
2. Another curve labeled "0.5 bar" representing an isobaric process at a pressure of 0.5 bar.  
3. Points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4" are marked along the curves, indicating different states in the process.  
4. A dashed line labeled "0.16" appears near state 1, possibly indicating a specific entropy value.  

The diagram qualitatively illustrates the thermodynamic process, with isobars and states clearly labeled.
