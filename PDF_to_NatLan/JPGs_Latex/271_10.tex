TASK 4a  
The diagram represents the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram.  

- The x-axis is labeled as temperature (\(T\)) in Kelvin (\([K]\)).  
- The y-axis is labeled as pressure (\(p\)).  
- A curve is drawn, representing the phase boundary between solid and liquid states.  
- The triple point is marked on the curve, labeled as "Triple".  
- Two steps are indicated:  
  - Step \(i\) is shown as a vertical line moving upward, representing the isobaric evaporation process.  
  - Step \(ii\) is shown as a vertical line moving downward, representing the pressure reduction below the triple point to induce sublimation.  
- The regions are labeled as "Fest" (solid) and "Fl√ºssig" (liquid).  

This diagram qualitatively illustrates the freeze-drying process with the transitions between phase regions.
