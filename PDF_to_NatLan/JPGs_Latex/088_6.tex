TASK 4a  
The graph is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. It shows the freeze-drying process with labeled points corresponding to different states. The diagram includes phase regions and transitions between states. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are connected by arrows to represent the process steps. The axes are labeled as \( p \) (pressure) and \( T \) (temperature).

TASK 4b  
The initial temperature is given as \( T_i = 283.15 \, \text{K} \). The sublimation temperature is \( T_{\text{sublimation}} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \), which corresponds to \( T_i \).  
The temperature of the evaporator is \( T_{\text{evaporator}} = 277.15 \, \text{K} \), with a temperature difference of \( 6^\circ \text{C} \).  
At state 2, the temperature is \( T_2 = 46^\circ \text{C} \), and the vapor quality is \( x_2 = 1 \).  
Using Table A10, the entropy values are \( s_3 = s_2 = 0.8169 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).  

Interpolation is performed at 8 bar:  
\[
h_3 = h_{\text{sat}} + \frac{h(40) - h_{\text{sat}}}{s(40) - s_{\text{sat}}} \cdot (s_3 - s_{\text{sat}})
\]  
The resulting enthalpy is \( h_3 = 267.33 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

The mass flow rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{285.53 \, \text{J/s}}{267.33 \, \text{kJ/kg}} = 1.57 \, \text{g/s}
\]

TASK 4c  
The throttling process is adiabatic and isenthalpic, meaning \( h_4 = h_3 \).  
For the isobaric process at \( p_4 = p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \):  
\[
h_4 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
For the isobaric process at \( p_1 = p_2 = 3.3765 \, \text{bar} \):  
\[
h_1 = 3.3765 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Using interpolation at \( T_2 = 46^\circ \text{C} \):  
\[
x = \frac{h_4 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = 0.156
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance (\( \epsilon_K \)) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{285 \, \text{J/s}}{28 \, \text{W}} = 8.75
\]
