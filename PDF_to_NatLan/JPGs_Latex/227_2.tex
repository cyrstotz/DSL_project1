TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn representing a T-s diagram for a jet engine process. The diagram includes the following features:  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T(K) \) (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( S \) (entropy).  
- The process begins at point \( 1 \), moves isothermally to point \( 2 \), then transitions to point \( 3 \) along an isobaric line.  
- From point \( 3 \), the process continues to point \( 4 \), and then to point \( 5 \), ending at point \( 6 \).  
- The isothermal and isobaric processes are clearly marked.  
- The diagram includes a feedback loop labeled \( W_D \) and \( k_{p} \cdot k \).  

TASK 2b  
The process from state \( 5 \) to state \( 6 \) is described as adiabatic and reversible, which implies it is isentropic.  

A table is provided with the following data:  
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{State} & P (\text{pressure}) & T (\text{temperature}) & W (\text{velocity}) \\
\hline
0 & 0.191 & 243.15 & 200 \\
1 & & & \\
2 & & & \\
3 & & & \\
4 & & & \\
5 & 0.5 & 431.9 & 220 \\
6 & 0.191 & & \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The efficiency of the compressor is noted as \( \eta_{1,5} < 1 \).  

No further explanation or calculations are provided.
