TASK 2a  
The page contains calculations and a diagram related to Task 2, which involves the jet engine exergy problem.  

### Diagram Description:  
A graph is drawn with axes labeled \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (entropy). The graph qualitatively represents the thermodynamic process of the jet engine. The curve includes labeled points corresponding to states \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The process appears to include isentropic compression, heat addition, and expansion.

TASK 2b  
The outlet temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the isentropic relation:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
w_6^2 = 2 c_p (T_5 - T_6) + w_5^2
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
w_6^2 = 2 \cdot 1.006 \cdot (431.9 - 328.07) + 220^2
\]  
\[
w_6 = 371.405 \, \text{m/s}
\]

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2}
\]  
The enthalpy difference is:  
\[
h_6 - h_0 = c_p \cdot (T_6 - T_0)
\]  
The entropy difference is:  
\[
s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right)
\]  
Substituting constants:  
\[
R = \frac{c_p - c_v}{\kappa} = 0.3013 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  

Final calculation:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = 85.43 \, \text{kJ/kg} + \frac{371.405^2}{2} - \frac{220^2}{2}
\]  

No numerical result is provided for \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \).
