TASK 2a  
The page begins with a graph labeled as a \( T \)-\( S \) diagram. The graph illustrates the thermodynamic process of a jet engine, with states labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The graph includes isobars (constant pressure lines) labeled \( p_0 = p_6 \), \( p_2 = p_3 \), and \( p_4 = p_5 \). The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and \( S \) (entropy in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}} \)) on the horizontal axis.  

TASK 2b  
The mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_0 \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
\dot{m}_0 = \rho_6 A_6 w_6 \left( \frac{T_b}{T_5} \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
where \( T_b = 32.8 \, \text{K} \).  

Additionally, the following relationships are derived:  
\[
p = \frac{1}{v_0}, \quad p_6 v_6 = m_6 R T_6, \quad R = \frac{c_p - c_v}{n} = 0.287 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}}
\]  

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = m_{\text{ges}} \left( h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) \right)
\]  
where:  
\[
h_6 - h_0 = c_p (T_6 - T_0) = 97.431 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}}
\]  
\[
T_6 = 340 \, \text{K}, \quad T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} = 243.15 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) = 0.3373 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}}
\]  

The calculation for \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is incomplete, as indicated by the unfinished equation.  

Additional notes:  
The equations for \( T_0 / T_5 \) and \( V_6 / V_5 \) are derived using the relationship:  
\[
\left( \frac{T_0}{T_5} \right) = \left( \frac{V_6}{V_5} \right)^{n-1}
\]  
and:  
\[
V_5 = \frac{R T_5}{p_5}, \quad V_6 = \frac{R T_6}{p_6} = 4.93 \, \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_6 \) is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m}_6 = \frac{1}{V_6} A_6 w_6
\]  
and:  
\[
\dot{m}_6 V_6 = -W_6, \quad \frac{\dot{m}_6 V_6}{A_6} = w_6
\]
