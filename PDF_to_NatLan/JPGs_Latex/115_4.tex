TASK 2a  
The page contains two diagrams related to thermodynamic processes.  

**Diagram 1:**  
The first diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) (temperature-entropy) diagram. It shows a thermodynamic process with labeled points and arrows indicating the direction of the process. The curve begins at point 1 and moves upward to point 2, then transitions to point 3. The process appears to involve compression and heat addition, as indicated by the upward trajectory.  

**Diagram 2:**  
The second diagram is another \( T \)-\( s \) diagram with more detailed labeling. It includes points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The curve starts at point 1 and moves upward to point 3, indicating an increase in temperature and entropy. From point 3, the curve descends to point 4, then transitions through points 5 and 6.  

Axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) (temperature) in Kelvin \([K]\).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( s \) (entropy) in \([kJ/kgÂ·K]\).  

Additional notes:  
- There is a handwritten note near point 1 that reads: "Triple Temp als u." This likely refers to the triple point temperature.  
- The diagrams visually represent thermodynamic processes such as compression, heat addition, and expansion.
