TASK 2a  
The table lists the states of the jet engine process with the following parameters:  

- **State 0**:  
  \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
  \( T = 243.15 \, \text{K} \)  
  \( w = 200 \, \text{m/s} \)  
  \( s_0 = s_1 \)  

- **State 1**:  
  \( p = p_5 \)  
  \( T = 431.9 \, \text{K} \)  
  \( w = 220 \, \text{m/s} \)  
  \( s_1 = s_2 \)  

- **State 2**:  
  \( p = p_3 = p_2 \)  
  \( T = \text{not specified} \)  
  \( w = \text{not specified} \)  
  \( s_2 = s_3 \)  

- **State 5**:  
  \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
  \( T = 431.9 \, \text{K} \)  
  \( w = 220 \, \text{m/s} \)  
  \( s_5 = s_6 \)  

- **State 6**:  
  \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
  \( T = \text{not specified} \)  
  \( w = \text{not specified} \)  
  \( s_6 = s_5 \)  

Below the table, a graph is drawn to represent the process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).  
- The graph includes labeled states (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6).  
- Isobars are drawn for \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) and \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The isobars are described as "somewhat steep."  

TASK 2b  
The energy balance for the nozzle is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right]
\]  
This equation is used to calculate the outlet velocity \( w_6 \):  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 \left( h_5 - h_6 \right) + w_5^2}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot 104.45 \, \text{kJ/kg} + (220 \, \text{m/s})^2}
\]  
The result is:  
\[
w_6 = 220.57 \, \text{m/s}
\]
