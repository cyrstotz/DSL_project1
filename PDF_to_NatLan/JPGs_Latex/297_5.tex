TASK 3a  
The pressure of the gas in state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{F_{p,K}}{A} + \frac{F_{p,\text{EW}}}{A}
\]  
The area \( A \) is determined using the diameter of the cylinder:  
\[
A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} = \pi \cdot \left(\frac{10}{100}\right)^2 = 7.854 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^2
\]  
The force due to the piston is:  
\[
F_{p,K} = m_K \cdot g = 32 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 313.92 \, \text{N}
\]  
The force due to the ice-water mixture is:  
\[
F_{p,\text{EW}} = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot g = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 0.981 \, \text{N}
\]  
Thus, the pressure is:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1 \, \text{bar} + \frac{313.92 \, \text{N} + 0.981 \, \text{N}}{7.854 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^2} = 140069.38 \, \text{Pa}
\]  

The gas mass is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} \cdot V}{R \cdot T} = \frac{140069.38 \, \text{Pa} \cdot 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3}{166.11 \, \text{J/(kgÂ·K)} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K}} = 3.483 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg}
\]

TASK 3b  
The ice mass fraction in state 1 is given as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.6
\]  
The pressure in state 2 is equal to the pressure in state 1:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]  
This is because the change in the ice fraction does not significantly affect the pressure difference between the gas and the ice-water mixture. There is no change in the gravitational force acting on the piston, and the volume of the ice-water mixture remains constant.

TASK 3d  
The energy balance for the system on the ice-water side is:  
\[
\Delta E = E_2 - m_{\text{EW}} \cdot E_1 = Q_{12}
\]  
The heat transfer is:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (u_2 - u_1)
\]  
The pressure on the ice-water side is:  
\[
p_{\text{EW}} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{F_{p,K}}{A} = 1.6 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The internal energy change is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = u_1 + \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}} = -1855.1 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
The temperature in state 2 is:  
\[
T_{2,\text{EW}} = 0.003^\circ \text{C}
\]  

The final ice fraction is calculated using the solid-liquid equilibrium table:  
\[
x_{2,\text{ice}} = \frac{u_2 - u_{2,\text{fluid}}}{u_{\text{fluid},2} - u_{\text{ice},2}} = 0.555
\]
