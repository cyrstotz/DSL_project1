TASK 4b  
The work done is expressed as:  
\[
W = \dot{m} (h_3 - h_2)
\]  
The mass flow rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{W}{h_3 - h_2} = \frac{28 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kW}}{268.82 - 243.72} = 0.00115 \, \text{kg/s}
\]

TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is given by:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{s_1 - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]  

---

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\lvert \dot{Q}_K \rvert}{\lvert W \rvert} = \frac{\lvert \dot{Q}_K \rvert}{\lvert \dot{Q}_K \rvert - \lvert \dot{Q}_{\text{loss}} \rvert}
\]
