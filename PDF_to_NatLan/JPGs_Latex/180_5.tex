TASK 4a  
A pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram is drawn. The diagram includes the following features:  
- A curve labeled "flüssig" (liquid) representing the boundary between liquid and two-phase regions.  
- A region labeled "2-phasen" (two-phase) below the curve.  
- A vertical line labeled "sublim" (sublimation) intersecting the curve.  
- A horizontal line labeled "tripel" (triple point) crossing the vertical sublimation line.  
- The axes are labeled \(p\) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \(T\) (temperature) on the horizontal axis.  
- A point labeled "i" is marked within the diagram.  

TASK 4b  
An energy balance equation is written:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] - \dot{W}_K
\]  
Rearranging for mass flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
The mass flow rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m} = 1.145 \, \text{kg/s}
\]  

Values are provided for the temperatures and enthalpies:  
- \(T_i = \text{sublim} - 10 \, \text{K} = 263.15 \, \text{K}\)  
- \(T_1 = 263.15 \, \text{K}\)  
- \(T_2 = 257.154 \, \text{K}\)  
- \(h_2 = 237.74 \, \text{kJ/kg}\)  
- \(h_3 = 251.3 \, \text{kJ/kg}\)  

Entropy values are also noted:  
- \(s_2 = s_3 = 0.5258 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}\)  

TASK 4c  
The following relationships are written:  
\[
s_4 = s_1
\]  
\[
p_4 = p_1
\]  

At \(s_4\) and 8 bar, \(x = 0\), the entropy is:  
\[
s_4 = 0.3455 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

The vapor quality \(x_1\) is calculated using:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{s_1 - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]  
Where:  
- \(T_1 = 263.15 \, \text{K}\)  
- \(s_f = 0.1583 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}\)  
- \(s_g = 0.5235 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}\)  

Intermediate calculations are shown:  
\[
s_1 = 0.3253 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  
\[
x_1 = \frac{0.3253 - 0.1583}{0.5235 - 0.1583} = 0.4773
\]  

The final vapor quality is:  
\[
x = 0.4773
\]
