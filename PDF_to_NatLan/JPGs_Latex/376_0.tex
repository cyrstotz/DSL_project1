TASK 3c  
The page contains equations and a sketch related to heat transfer and thermodynamic processes.  

A simple sketch is drawn, showing a horizontal system with heat flow \( \dot{Q} \) indicated by an arrow pointing upwards.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
O = \dot{m}_w (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  

The work term \( \dot{W} \) is defined as:  
\[
\dot{W} = R(T_2 - T_1) + \nu_0 (v_2 - v_1)
\]  

This is further simplified:  
\[
\dot{W} = \frac{R(T_2 - T_1)}{\tau - n}
\]  

A note states "Druck bleibt gleich" (pressure remains constant).  

The heat transfer equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{m}_g (h_1 - h_2) - \dot{Q}
\]  

Finally, the heat flow \( \dot{Q} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m}_g c_p (T_1 - T_2) = 7.083 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

Key points:  
- The sketch represents a system with heat flow.  
- The equations describe energy balance, work, and heat transfer under constant pressure conditions.
