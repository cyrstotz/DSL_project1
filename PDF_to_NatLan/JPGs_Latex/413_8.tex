TASK 3c  
Energy balance for a closed system involving gas:  

The equation for heat transfer is given as:  
\[
Q = W_v + (U_2 - U_1) m_g
\]  

The work term \( W_v \) is calculated as:  
\[
W_v = R (T_2 - T_1) \quad \text{where } R = \frac{316.458 \, \text{J}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

The specific heat ratio \( h \) is determined as:  
\[
h = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = \frac{c_v + R}{c_v} = \frac{166.28 + 633}{633} = 1.2626
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q = 316.458 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}} + c_v (T_2 - T_1)
\]

TASK 3d  
Case: Ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \)  

Initial conditions:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.6, \quad m = 0.1 \, \text{kg}, \quad U_{\text{new}} = U_{\text{EW}}
\]  

Energy balance for a closed system:  
\[
Q = m (U_2 - U_1)
\]  

The internal energy \( U_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
U_1 = x_{\text{ice},1} (u_{\text{ice}} - u_{\text{fluid}}) + u_{\text{fluid}}
\]  

Values used:  
\[
u_{\text{fluid}} = -0.045 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}, \quad u_{\text{ice}} = -333.458 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Final calculation for \( U_1 \):  
\[
U_1 = -200.0928 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

A small sketch is visible showing a horizontal line labeled "m" and "2." It appears to represent a simplified diagram of the system but lacks detailed annotations.
