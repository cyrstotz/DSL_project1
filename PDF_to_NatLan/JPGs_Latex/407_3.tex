TASK 2a  
The following equations and expressions are written:  

1. The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated as:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot \left( h_5 - h_6 \right) + w_5^2}
\]  

2. The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = \left( h_6 - h_0 \right) - T_0 \cdot \left( s_6 - s_0 \right) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2}
\]  

3. The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is given by:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} - \left( h_5 - h_0 \right) - T_0 \cdot \left( s_5 - s_0 \right)
\]  

TASK 2b  
The process flow is described with the following equation:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot \left( h_5 - h_6 \right) + w_5^2}
\]  

TASK 2c  
The entropy production is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\dot{Q}}{T_{\text{mean}}} - \Delta S
\]  

TASK 2d  
The state process is described with the following equation:  
\[
\frac{2}{z_M - z_K} \cdot \left( h_M - h_K \right) \cdot v_d = \frac{2}{z_M - z_K} \cdot \int_{0}^{\infty} v_d \, dp
\]
