TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn showing a qualitative temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) diagram for the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled points corresponding to different states (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). The process transitions are marked as "isobar" for constant pressure processes. The graph starts at state 1, moves to state 2, then state 3, followed by state 4, state 5, and finally state 6. The axes are labeled with \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( S \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis.

TASK 2b  
The outlet velocity \( w_5 \) is given as:  
\[
w_5 = 220 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\]

The outlet pressure \( p_5 \) is given as:  
\[
p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}
\]

The outlet temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the following steps:  

The relationship between \( T_6 \) and \( T_3 \) is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_3} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_3} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]

Substituting known values:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \cdot \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]

Where:  
\[
T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}, \quad p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}, \quad p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}, \quad \kappa = 1.4
\]

Calculation:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \cdot \left( \frac{0.191 \, \text{bar}}{0.5 \, \text{bar}} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}}
\]

\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \cdot 0.381 = 328.1 \, \text{K}
\]

Final result:  
\[
T_6 = 328.1 \, \text{K}
\]
