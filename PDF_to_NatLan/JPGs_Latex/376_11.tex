TASK 2b  
The energy balance equation for the jet engine is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_6 - h_5 + \frac{w_6^2 - w_5^2}{2} \right) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  

The process is described as **isentropic compression**.  

From the isentropic relationship:  
\[
u = \eta = 1.9
\]  

The temperature ratio for the isentropic process is given by:  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{v_1}{v_2} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  

Here, the specific case is:  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_5} = \left( \frac{v_6}{v_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa}}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{v_0}{v_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

The final temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated to be \( 328.07 \, \text{K} \).
