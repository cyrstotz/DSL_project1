TASK 4e  
The enthalpy \( h \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
h = h_f + x \cdot (h_g - h_f)
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_a \) is given by:  
\[
\epsilon_a = \left| \frac{\dot{Q}_{zu}}{\dot{W}_k} \right| = \frac{\dot{Q}_{zu}}{\dot{Q}_{ab} - \dot{Q}_{zu}}
\]  

TASK 4e  
The temperature \( T_i \) remains constant after all sublimation has occurred.
