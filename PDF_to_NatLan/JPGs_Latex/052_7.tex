TASK 4b  
The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3} = \frac{0.00 \, \text{kg/s} \cdot h_3}{h_2 - h_3} = 6.899 \, \text{kg/s}
\]  

TASK 4c  
The enthalpy at state 4 (\( h_4 \)) is determined, assuming \( x > 0 \) and \( \Delta h \) is given. Thus:  
\[
h_4 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_4 - h_1) \implies h_4 - h_1
\]  

The pressure is given as:  
\[
p = 4.2391 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_4 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = 0.337
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance (\( \epsilon_K \)) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} \implies \epsilon_K = \frac{156.28 \, \text{kW}}{5.581 \, \text{kW}} = 5.581
\]  

The heat transfer equation is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1) + \dot{Q}_{zu} \implies \dot{Q}_{zu} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1) = 156.28 \, \text{kW}
\]  

TASK 4e  
The temperature would continue to decrease and drop further, as additional power of \( 28 \, \text{W} \) is supplied to the cooling cycle.
