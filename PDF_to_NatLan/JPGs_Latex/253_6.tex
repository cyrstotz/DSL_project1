TASK 3c  
The first law of thermodynamics is applied to the gas system:  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
Substituting the internal energy change:  
\[
m_g c_V (T_{2g} - T_{1g}) = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
The work term \( W_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
W_{12} = \int p \, dV = R(T_{2g} - T_{1g}) = -83.14 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
Thus, the heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_{2g} - T_{1g}) - 83.14 \, \text{kJ} = -82 \, \text{kJ}
\]

TASK 3d  
The first law of thermodynamics is applied to the ice-water mixture (EW):  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
Since the volume is constant (\( V = \text{const} \)), the work term \( W_{12} \) is zero:  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = Q_{12}
\]  
The internal energy change for the EW system is expressed as:  
\[
(U_2 - U_1)_{\text{EW}} = Q_{12} = 1.5 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
The final internal energy \( U_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
U_2 = \frac{1.5 \, \text{kJ}}{m_{\text{EW}}} + U_1
\]  
The initial internal energy \( U_1 \) is determined using:  
\[
U_1 = U_f(p = 1.6 \, \text{bar}) + x_{\text{ice},1}(U_f - U_f')
\]  
Where \( U_f(p = 1.6 \, \text{bar}) \approx -133.45 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).
