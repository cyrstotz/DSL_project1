TASK 4a  
The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes the following features:  

- The curve represents the phase boundary between liquid and vapor.  
- Four states are labeled:  
  - State 1 is located in the vapor region.  
  - State 2 is on the phase boundary, indicating isobaric evaporation.  
  - State 3 is in the superheated region, showing the result of compression to 8 bar.  
  - State 4 is in the liquid region, representing condensation.  
- The critical temperature (\(T_{\text{crit}}\)) is marked at the peak of the curve.  
- The pressure at state 3 is labeled as "8 bar."  

The graph visually represents the refrigeration cycle of R134a during the freeze-drying process.
