TASK 2a  
A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), representing temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}] \), representing specific entropy.  

The diagram includes the following features:  
- Points labeled \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \) connected by lines.  
- The process between points \( 0 \) and \( 1 \) is labeled "isobar".  
- The process between points \( 1 \) and \( 3 \) is labeled "isotherm".  
- The process between points \( 3 \) and \( 4 \) is labeled "isotherm".  
- The process between points \( 4 \) and \( 5 \) is labeled "isobar".  

TASK 2b  
An interpolation formula is provided:  
\[
Y = Y_1 + \frac{Y_2 - Y_1}{X_2 - X_1} \cdot (X - X_1)
\]

TASK 2c  
The following equations and notes are written:  
- \( p_0 = p_c \)  
- A steady-state energy balance at the nozzle is described:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_5 - h_6) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]
- The work term is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{W} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_5 - h_6)
\]
- The enthalpy \( h_5 \) at \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( 431.9 \, \text{K} \) is interpolated using Table A-22 for \( x_1 = 430 \, \text{K} \) and \( x_2 = 440 \, \text{K} \).

TASK 2d  
The mass flow rates for the bypass and core streams are calculated:  
\[
\dot{m}_M = \dot{m}_K \cdot 5.293
\]
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{total}} = 6.293 \cdot \dot{m}_K
\]
