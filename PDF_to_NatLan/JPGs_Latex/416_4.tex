TASK 2a  
The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(S\)) diagram.  
- The axes are labeled as \(T\) (temperature in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and \(S\) (entropy) on the horizontal axis.  
- The process includes labeled states: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.  
- The diagram shows isobaric and isentropic processes:  
  - Between states 0 and 1, the process is isentropic.  
  - Between states 1 and 2, the process is isobaric.  
  - Between states 2 and 3, the process is isobaric.  
  - Between states 5 and 6, the process is isentropic.  
- Pressure values are noted: \(p_2\), \(p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}\), and \(p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}\).  
- The diagram includes arrows indicating the direction of the processes.  

TASK 2b  
The equation for density is given as:  
\[
\rho = \frac{p}{R T}
\]  
The molar mass is specified as \(M_L = 28.52 \, \text{kg/mol}\) (from Table A1).  

The energy balance for the jet engine is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right) + \frac{p}{R} \frac{T_6 - T_5}{1 - n} - L_{d}
\]  
Simplified to:  
\[
0 = h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} - \frac{p}{R} \frac{T_6 - T_5}{1 - n}
\]  

The temperature \(T_6\) is calculated using:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

The outlet velocity \(w_6\) is determined using:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 c_p (T_5 - T_6) + \frac{w_5^2}{2} - 2 \frac{p}{R} \frac{T_6 - T_5}{1 - n}}
\]
