TASK 3c  
The final gas temperature is given as \( T_{g,2} = 0.003 \, ^\circ\text{C} = 273.153 \, \text{K} \).  

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
\Delta E = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  

For the perfect gas system:  
\[
\Delta E = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

The heat transfer equation is:  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) + W_{12}
\]  

The work done is expressed as:  
\[
W_{12} = -p_0 \cdot (V_2 - V_1)
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
W_{12} = -0.2842 \, \text{kg} \cdot p_0 \cdot (V_2 - V_1) = -28.42 \, \text{J}
\]  

TASK 3d  
From the equilibrium table, the final temperature \( T_2 \) is \( T_2 = T_{\text{ice}} = 0.003 \, ^\circ\text{C} = 273.153 \, \text{K} \).  

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
\Delta E = W_{12}
\]  

The heat transfer equation is:  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) + W_{12}
\]  

Using the equilibrium table for ice-water mixture:  
\[
Q_{12} = 15003 \, \text{J}
\]  

The final ice fraction is calculated as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.045
\]
