TASK 1a  
The page begins with a graph labeled "Aufgabe 1" (Task 1). The graph is a qualitative \( p \)-\( T \) diagram with axes labeled \( p \) (pressure) and \( T \) (temperature). The curve represents phase transitions, with regions marked as "Subl." (sublimation) and "Tripelpunkt" (triple point). The triple point is highlighted with a circle and labeled as "-1".  

TASK 1b  
An energy balance equation is written:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) + \dot{Q}_K - \dot{W}_K
\]  
The enthalpy \( h_2 \) is defined as \( h_{\text{R134a}} \) at \( T = T_i - 6 \, \text{K} \) and \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), with vapor quality \( x = 0.9 \).  
The enthalpy \( h_3 \) is also \( h_{\text{R134a}} \), but the specific details are crossed out and unclear.  
Entropy is noted as \( s_2 = s_3 \).  

TASK 1c  
Another energy balance equation is written:  
\[
Q = \text{mass} \left[ \text{vapor quality} \times \text{latent heat} \right] + Q - W
\]  

TASK 1d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]
