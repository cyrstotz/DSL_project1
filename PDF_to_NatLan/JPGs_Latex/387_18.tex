TASK 2a  
The page begins with a graph labeled as a T-s diagram. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis, and entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis. The diagram illustrates the thermodynamic process of a jet engine, with labeled states and isobars.  

- State points \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \) and \( 6 \) are marked along the process path.  
- The isobars \( p_0, p_1, p_2 = p_3, p_4, \) and \( p_5 \) are shown as dashed lines.  
- The process path includes compression, combustion, and expansion stages, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
- The curve transitions from state \( 0 \) to \( 1 \), then to \( 2 \), followed by \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and finally \( 6 \).  

TASK 2b  
The equation for the gas constant \( R \) is provided:  
\[
R = c_p - \frac{T_0}{1.4} = 288 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

TASK 2b (continued)  
The outlet temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
T_0 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{k-1}{k}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_0 = 288.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated using:  
\[
w_6 = R \frac{T_0 - T_0}{\eta - n}
\]  
Result:  
\[
w_6 = -61.2 \, \text{m/s}
\]  

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
ex_{\text{flow}} = (c_p(T_6 - T_0) - T_0(c_p \ln \frac{T_6}{T_0}) - R \ln \frac{p_6}{p_0}) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2}
\]  

Final expression:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = f(T_6, w_6, u_6)
\]
