TASK 3d  
The initial ice mass fraction is given as \( x_1 = 0.6 \).  

The mass of the ice-water mixture is \( m_{\text{EW}} = 0.06 \, \text{kg} \), and the specific internal energy of the mixture is \( u_f = 333.458 \, \text{J} \).  

Heat transfer occurs, with \( Q = +775.23 \, \text{J} \), causing a reduction in the ice mass.  

The change in mass of ice is calculated using:  
\[
\Delta m = \frac{Q}{\Delta u} = -0.00232 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The final ice mass fraction is determined as:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{0.06 \, \text{kg} - 0.00232 \, \text{kg}}{0.06 \, \text{kg}} = 0.5767
\]  

This calculation shows the reduction in ice mass and the updated ice fraction in the mixture.
