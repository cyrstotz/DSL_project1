TASK 2a  
The first diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \).  

The process includes the following states:  
1. Starting at state 1, the curve rises to state 2, representing compression.  
2. From state 2 to state 3, the curve moves horizontally, indicating isobaric heat addition.  
3. The curve drops from state 3 to state 4, representing adiabatic expansion.  
4. The process ends at state 5, with a slight rise in entropy.  

The diagram includes labeled isobars \( p_1 \), \( p_3 \), and \( p_5 \), which curve downward.  

TASK 2b  
The second diagram is another \( T \)-\( s \) representation of the jet engine process, with additional details:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \).  

The process includes the following states:  
1. Starting at state 1, the curve rises to state 2, representing compression.  
2. From state 2 to state 3, the curve moves horizontally, indicating isobaric heat addition.  
3. The curve drops from state 3 to state 4, representing adiabatic expansion.  
4. From state 4 to state 5, the curve moves horizontally again, indicating mixing.  
5. The process ends at state 6, with a slight rise in entropy.  

The diagram includes labeled isobars \( p_1 = p_3 \), \( p_5 = p_6 \), which curve downward.  

TASK 2b  
Energy balance for the system:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_6 - h_0 + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2} \right]
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
2(h_6 - h_0) = w_6^2 - w_0^2
\]  
The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is given by:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{w_0^2 + 2(h_6 - h_0)}
\]  

The enthalpy difference \( h_6 - h_0 \) is expressed as:  
\[
h_6 - h_0 = c_p (T_6 - T_0)
\]  

The temperature ratio \( \frac{T_6}{T_5} \) is calculated using:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]
