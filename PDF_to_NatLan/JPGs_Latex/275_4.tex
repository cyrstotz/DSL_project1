TASK 3a  
The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is calculated as:  
\[
A_2 = 5 \, \text{cm}^2 = 0.007854 \, \text{m}^2
\]  

The specific heat capacity at constant volume is given as:  
\[
c_V = 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} = 633 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  

The molar mass of the gas is:  
\[
M_g = 50 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{kmol}} = 50 \, \frac{\text{g}}{\text{mol}}
\]  

The gas constant is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g} = 166.28 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  

The ideal gas law is applied:  
\[
p_1 V_1 = R T_1
\]  

The pressure in state 1 is determined as:  
\[
p_1 = p_{\text{atm}} + \frac{m_K g}{A_2} + \frac{m_{\text{EW}} g}{A_2} = 1.4009 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The specific volume of the gas in state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
V_1 = \frac{R T_1}{p_1} = 0.91769 \, \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The mass of the gas is determined as:  
\[
m_g = \frac{V_g}{V_1} = 0.00342716 \, \text{kg}
\]  

TASK 3b  
The pressure in state 2 is equal to the pressure exerted by the piston:  
\[
p_2 = p_z \quad \text{(as it is evenly distributed by the piston)}
\]  

The temperature in state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_2 = 0.003^\circ\text{C} \quad \text{(phase equilibrium)}
\]  

Converting to Kelvin:  
\[
T_2 = 273.18 \, \text{K}
\]  

The specific volume in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
V_2 = m_g V_1 \cdot \frac{R T_2}{p_2 m_g} = 0.00107076 \, \text{m}^3
\]  

TASK 3c  
The work done during the pressure change is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta W_{12} = \Delta p V_2 = -284.72 \, \text{J}
\]  

TASK 3d  
The energy change is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta u_g = m_g (u_1 - u_2) + \Delta W + \Delta Q_n = -316.78 \, \text{kJ} - 1.366 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The change in internal energy per unit mass is expressed as:  
\[
u_1 - u_2 = c_V \Delta T
\]
