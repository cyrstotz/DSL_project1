TASK 3a  
The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is equal to \( p_{g,2} \), which is \( 4.075 \, \text{bar} \).  

The same equilibrium conditions apply as in subtask (a), but no mass flow occurs. The equilibrium is temperature-dependent.  

The system is described as an isolated cylinder.  

The heat transfer is expressed as:  
\[
Q_1 = Q_2
\]  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
m_g \cdot c_V \cdot T_{g,1} + x_{E,1} \cdot u_{\text{fus}} + (T - T_{\text{EW,1}}) \cdot m_{\text{EW}} \cdot u_{\text{ice}} - m_{\text{EW}} \cdot T_{\text{EW,1}} = T_{g,2} \cdot \left( m_g \cdot c_V + x_{E,2} \cdot u_{\text{fus}} \right)
\]

TASK 3c  
The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = c_V \cdot m_g \cdot \left( (500 + 273.15) \, \text{K} - (10.0037 \cdot 273.15) \, \text{K} \right) = 305.85 \, \text{kJ}
\]
