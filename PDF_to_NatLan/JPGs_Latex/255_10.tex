TASK 4c  
The first law of thermodynamics is applied to the system, represented by the equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left[ h_1 - h_2 \right] + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
where \( h_1 \) and \( h_2 \) are enthalpies at states 1 and 2, respectively.  

The enthalpy at state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
h_1 = -\frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}}} + h_2
\]  

The pressure at state 1 is given as \( p_1 = p_2 = 3.3756 \, \text{bar} \), referencing Table A10 for R134a properties.  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) at state 1 is determined using the enthalpy relation:  
\[
h_1 = h_f + x_1 \left( h_g - h_f \right)
\]  
Solving for \( x_1 \):  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) for the cooling cycle is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{Q}_{\text{cold}} - \dot{Q}_K}
\]
