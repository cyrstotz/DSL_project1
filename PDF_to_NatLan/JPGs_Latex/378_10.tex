TASK 4c  
The final ice fraction \( x_a \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_a = \frac{S_2 - S_f}{S_g - S_f}
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is expressed as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{28W}
\]

The heat transfer \( \dot{Q}_K \) is derived from the energy balance:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_1) + \dot{Q}_{2v} - \dot{W}_v
\]

Since \( \dot{W}_v \) is negligible, the equation simplifies to:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{2v} = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_1)
\]

Thus, the coefficient of performance becomes:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{m}(h_2 - h_1)}{28W}
\]
