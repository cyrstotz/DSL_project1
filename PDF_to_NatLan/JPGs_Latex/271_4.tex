TASK 2a  
A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn. The diagram shows the thermodynamic process of a jet engine with labeled states:  
- State 0 represents the ambient condition.  
- State 2 is the compressed air after the compressor.  
- State 3 is the high-temperature state after combustion.  
- State 4 is the turbine outlet.  
- State 5 is the mixed flow after the mixing chamber.  
- State 6 is the nozzle exit.  

The diagram includes isobars labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), and \( p_2 \), with \( p_2 > p_1 > p_0 \). The process lines indicate compression, isobaric combustion, expansion, and mixing.  

TASK 2b  
The energy balance for the adiabatic system is written as:  
\[
\Delta F = m_{x,2} - m_{x,1}
\]  

TASK 2c  
The expression for the mass-specific increase in flow exergy is given as:  
\[
\dot{E}_x = m_{x,2} = m \left[ u_{x,0} - T_0 (s - s_0) \right]
\]  

TASK 2d  
The expression for exergy destruction is written as:  
\[
\dot{E}_{x,\text{dest}} = T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]
