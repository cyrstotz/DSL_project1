The entropy change \( \Delta S \) is calculated using the difference in mass and entropy values between states 1 and 2.  

The mass at state 2 is:  
\[
m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12} = 5755 \, \text{kg} + 3.1 \, \text{kg} = 10223.31 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The entropy at state 2 is determined using the entropy of saturated water:  
\[
s_2 = x s_g + (1 - x) s_f = 1.33774 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

Here:  
\[
s_g = 7.35449 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}, \quad s_f = 1.3063 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

The mean entropy \( s_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
s_2 = \frac{s_f + s_g}{2} = 4.3557 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

Using water table data (Table A-2), the entropy change is:  
\[
\Delta S = 36.828 \, \text{MJ/kg·K}
\]
