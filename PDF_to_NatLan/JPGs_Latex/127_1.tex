TASK 1a  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} \left[ h_1 \right] + Q_{\text{out}}
\]  

The change in mass flow is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 - Q_{\text{out}}
\]  

TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is defined as:  
\[
\bar{T}_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_e^a T \, dS}{S_a - S_e} = \frac{m (u_a - u_e)}{S_a - S_e}
\]  

TASK 1e  
The entropy change of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is given by:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 S_2 - m_1 S_1 = \Delta m_{12} S_c + \frac{Q_{\text{out}}}{\bar{T}_{\text{KF}}} + S_{\text{gen,12}}
\]
