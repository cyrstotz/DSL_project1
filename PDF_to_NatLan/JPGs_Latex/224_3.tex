The equation for the exergy destruction is given as:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = T_0 S_{\text{gen}} = T_0 m_{\text{res}} c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right)
\]  

The entropy generation is expressed as:  
\[
\Theta = m_{\text{res}} (s_6 - s_0) + S_{\text{res}}
\]  

Where \( s_6 - s_0 \) is calculated using:  
\[
c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right)
\]
