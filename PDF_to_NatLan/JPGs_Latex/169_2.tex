TASK 2a  
A temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram is drawn. The vertical axis represents temperature in Kelvin (\( T [K] \)), ranging from \( 243.15 \, \text{K} \) to \( 431.9 \, \text{K} \). The horizontal axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \text{kJ/kg·K} \).  
- The diagram includes labeled isobars:  
  - \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - \( p_0 = p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
- A reversible adiabatic (isentropic) process is indicated between states 5 and 6.  
- The curve transitions between states 5 and 6, with annotations showing the thermodynamic processes.  

TASK 2b  
The entropy balance for a stationary system is written as:  
\[
q = \dot{m} \cdot (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \text{irreversibilities}
\]  
This equation is partially crossed out and not fully legible.  

TASK 2c  
The energy balance for a stationary system between states 0 and 6 is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_6 - h_0) + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2}
\]  
Rearranging for \( w_6^2 - w_0^2 \):  
\[
\frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2} = h_0 - h_6
\]  
Solving for \( w_6 \):  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2(h_0 - h_6) + w_0^2}
\]  

The enthalpy difference \( h_0 - h_6 \) is expressed as:  
\[
h_0 - h_6 = \int_{T_0}^{T_6} c_p \, dT = c_p (T_6 - T_0)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
c_p = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}, \, T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} = 243.15 \, \text{K}, \, T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
h_0 - h_6 = 1.006 \cdot (431.9 - 243.15) = 190.5 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Finally, substituting into the velocity equation:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2(190.5) + 200^2} = \sqrt{381 + 40000} = 200.25 \, \text{m/s}
\]  

The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the isentropic relation:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}, \, p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}, \, p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}, \, \kappa = 1.4
\]  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \cdot \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}} = 431.9 \cdot (0.382) = 293.91 \, \text{K}
\]  

The final result for \( T_6 \) is boxed:  
\[
T_6 = 293.91 \, \text{K}
\]  

No additional diagrams or figures are present beyond the \( T \)-\( s \) diagram described above.
