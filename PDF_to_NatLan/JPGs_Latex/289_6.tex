TASK 3c  
The heat transferred between states 1 and 2 is denoted as \( Q_{12} \).  

Using the energy balance equation:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta U = Q_{12}
\]  

The change in internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = m_g (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  

For the gas, the internal energy change is calculated as:  
\[
m_g c_V (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) = Q_{12} = -1083.06 \, \text{J}
\]  

A note is written in the margin: "Energy balance of the entire system."

TASK 3d  
The equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture is given as:  
\[
T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} = T_{\text{EW},1} = T_{g,2}
\]  

The mass of the ice-water mixture is:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} = 0.1 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The initial ice fraction is:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.6
\]  

The heat transferred is:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1083.06 \, \text{J}
\]  

The final ice mass is calculated as:  
\[
m_{\text{ice},2} = 0.6 \cdot m_{\text{EW}} = 0.06 \, \text{kg}
\]
