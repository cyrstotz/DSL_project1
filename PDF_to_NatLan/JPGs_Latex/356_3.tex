TASK 2a  
The diagram represents a qualitative T-s diagram for the jet engine process. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is temperature \( T \) in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is entropy \( S \) in unspecified units.  

The diagram includes the following labeled states and processes:  
- State 0: Starting point of the process.  
- State 1: Isentropic compression.  
- State 2: Isentropic compression continues.  
- State 3: Adiabatic and irreversible process.  
- State 4: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 5: Isobaric heat addition continues.  
- State 6: Isentropic expansion.  

Arrows indicate the direction of each process, and the transitions between states are clearly marked. The temperature at the lower boundary is labeled as \( 243.15 \, \text{K} \).

TASK 2b  
The problem asks to determine \( w_6 \) (outlet velocity) and \( T_6 \) (outlet temperature).  

Given data:  
\[
w_5 = 220 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}, \quad p_0 = p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}, \quad p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}, \quad T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}
\]

Assuming an ideal gas:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} \cdot T_5
\]

Calculation:  
\[
T_6 = \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} \cdot 431.9 = 328.0746568 \, \text{K}
\]
