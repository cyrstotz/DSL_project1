TASK 1a  
The steady-state flow process is described using the energy and entropy balance equations.  

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(s_e - s_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
For an adiabatic process (\( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 0 \)), this simplifies to:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is given by:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}(h_a - h_e)
\]  

The enthalpy difference (\( h_a - h_e \)) is expressed as:  
\[
h_a - h_e = c_{\text{if}}(T_a - T_e) + \frac{v}{\rho}(p_a - p_e)
\]  
Here, \( p_2 = p_a \), indicating equal pressures.  

A diagram is included showing the heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) between the inlet and outlet temperatures \( T_{\text{KF,a}} \) and \( T_{\text{KF,e}} \).  

Finally, the heat flow is simplified to:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} c_{\text{if}} (T_{\text{KF,a}} - T_{\text{KF,e}})
\]

TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T \) is calculated using the entropy balance:  
\[
T = \frac{\int_{s_e}^{s_a} T \, ds}{s_a - s_e}
\]  

Using the relation \( \frac{q}{T} = s \), this simplifies to:  
\[
T = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{s_a - s_e}
\]  

The entropy difference \( s_a - s_e \) is expressed as:  
\[
s_a - s_e = \int_{T_1}^{T_s} c_{\text{if}} \frac{1}{T} \, dT = c_{\text{if}} \ln \left( \frac{T_s}{T_1} \right)
\]  

Substituting this into the equation for \( T \):  
\[
T = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{c_{\text{if}} \ln \left( \frac{T_s}{T_1} \right)}
\]  

This provides the thermodynamic mean temperature based on the heat flow and temperature range.
