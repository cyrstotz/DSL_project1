TASK 2a  
The diagram is a T-s diagram (temperature vs. entropy) illustrating the thermodynamic processes in the jet engine. The axes are labeled as \( T \, [K] \) for temperature and \( s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}}] \) for specific entropy.  
- The process begins at point \( 1 \), moves to point \( 2 \) along an isentropic compression line.  
- From point \( 2 \) to point \( 3 \), the process follows an isobaric heat addition path.  
- The process then moves to point \( 4 \) along an isentropic expansion line.  
- Points \( 5 \) and \( 6 \) are connected by an isobaric mixing process.  
Arrows indicate the direction of the processes, and the labels "isobaric" and "isentropic" are written to describe the respective paths.

TASK 2b  
The following equation appears partially written:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot (s_5 - s_6) + \dot{Q} \cdot \frac{1}{T} - s_{\text{gen}} = 0
\]  
This equation seems to represent an entropy balance, but parts of it are crossed out.  

Another expression is partially visible:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot [h_5 - h_6 - T_0 \cdot (s_5 - s_0)] + k_e
\]  
This appears to be related to the calculation of flow exergy or energy balance, but it is incomplete.  

The variable \( k_e \) is written, but no further explanation or equation is provided for it.  

No additional explanation or context is visible for these equations.
