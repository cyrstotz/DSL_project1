TASK 4a  
The graph represents a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as temperature (\( T \)) in degrees Celsius (\( ^\circ\text{C} \)), and the y-axis is labeled as pressure (\( p \)) in bar.  

The curve shown in the diagram represents the phase boundary between liquid and vapor regions. The region below the curve is labeled "fl√ºssig" (liquid).  

Key points and annotations on the graph:  
- A point labeled \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \) is marked along the curve.  
- Another point labeled \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) is marked further along the curve.  
- The phase transition is indicated by the curve separating the liquid and vapor phases.
