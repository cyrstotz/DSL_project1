TASK 3c  
The page contains mathematical calculations related to heat transfer. The equations are as follows:

\[
\frac{Q}{V} =
\]

\[
(1000 \, \text{W}) \cdot \frac{2}{\text{m}} = 2 \cdot W = 0.4 \cdot x
\]

\[
\frac{Q}{V} = 85.598 =
\]

\[
\frac{Q}{V} = 85.598 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{\text{m}} - V \right) =
\]

\[
Q \cdot \left( \frac{2}{\text{m}} - V \right) = 9.45 \cdot x = 
\]

The last equation appears partially crossed out, and the term "Scheinungsdruck" is written but unclear due to crossing out.

No diagrams or graphs are present on the page.
