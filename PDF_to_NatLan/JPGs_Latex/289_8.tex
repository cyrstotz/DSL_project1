TASK 4c  
The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h}
\]  
The temperature at state 2 is \( T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C} \), and the vapor quality \( x_2 \) is to be determined.  

For isenthalpic expansion:  
\[
h_2 = h_1
\]  
From the refrigerant data:  
\[
h_q(8 \, \text{bar}) - h_g(8 \, \text{bar}) = 264.77 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_T}
\]  

Using the energy balance:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1) + Q_K
\]  
Simplified:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1)
\]  

From the refrigerant data:  
\[
h_2(-22^\circ\text{C}) = h_g(-22^\circ\text{C}) = 29.77 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
This value is taken from part (c).  

Substituting:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1) = 0.265 \, \text{kW}
\]  

The coefficient of performance is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_T} = 0.61825
\]
