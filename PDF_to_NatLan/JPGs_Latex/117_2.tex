TASK 2a  
The airspeed is given as \( w_{\text{air}} = 200 \, \text{m/s} \), with ambient pressure \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) and ambient temperature \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} \).  

A temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram is drawn, showing the thermodynamic process of the jet engine. The diagram includes labeled points corresponding to states 1 through 6. The process involves compression, combustion, expansion, and mixing, with the following features:  
- \( p_2/p_3 \) is labeled as "isobars."  
- The curve between states 1 and 2 represents compression.  
- The curve between states 3 and 4 represents combustion.  
- The curve between states 4 and 5 represents expansion.  
- The curve between states 5 and 6 represents mixing.  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis, in \( \text{°C} \).  
- \( s \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis, in \( \text{kJ/kg·K} \).  

Below the diagram, a table is provided with the following columns:  
- \( p \) (pressure in \( \text{bar} \))  
- \( T \) (temperature in \( \text{°C} \))  
- \( q \) (specific heat transfer in \( \text{kJ/kg} \))  
- \( s \) (specific entropy in \( \text{kJ/kg·K} \))  

The table contains partial data:  
- At state 0: \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = -30^\circ\text{C} \).  
- At state 2: \( q = 1195 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  
- At state 5: \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  

Additional notes are written:  
- "adiabatic isentropic WG: \( \eta_{\text{comp}} < 1 \)"  
- "isobar"  

No further numerical values or explanations are provided.
