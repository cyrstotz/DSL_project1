TASK 4c  
The entropy at state 1 is equal to the entropy at state 4, which is given as \( s_1 = s_4 = s_f(p_4) = s_f(8 \, \text{bar}) \).  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{s_1 - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{|W_E|}
\]  

The work done by the compressor \( W_E^{\text{rev}} \) is expressed as:  
\[
W_E^{\text{rev}} = - \int_{1}^{2} v \, dp
\]  

Additionally, the specific work \( W_E' \) is given by:  
\[
W_E' = \frac{W_E^{\text{rev}}}{\dot{m}_E}
\]
