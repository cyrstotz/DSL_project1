TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{129.3}{28} = 4.6176
\]

TASK 4c  
The energy balance equation for the cooling cycle is written as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1) = 0.72536 \cdot (h_2 - h_1) = 725.3 \, \text{W}
\]  

The enthalpy values are determined as follows:  
\[
h_1 = h(1.5 \, \text{bar}, x = 0.2259) = h_f + x \cdot (h_g - h_f) = 87.4684 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
\[
h_2 = 237.29 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(from Table A-12, corresponding to Aufgabe b)}
\]

TASK 4e  
The temperature in Step ii would continue to decrease isochorically.
