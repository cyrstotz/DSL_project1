TASK 2a  
The page contains two diagrams related to thermodynamic processes.

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The graph is labeled with \( T \, [K] \) on the vertical axis and \( S \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}] \) on the horizontal axis.  
   - It appears to be a qualitative representation of a thermodynamic cycle on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) diagram.  
   - The cycle includes numbered points (1, 2, 3, 4) connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
   - The graph includes curved and straight lines, suggesting different thermodynamic processes such as isobaric or adiabatic transitions.  

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - This graph is also labeled with \( T \, [K] \) on the vertical axis and \( S \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}] \) on the horizontal axis.  
   - It depicts a closed thermodynamic cycle with five numbered points (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) connected by arrows.  
   - Two segments are explicitly labeled as "isobar," indicating constant pressure processes.  
   - The cycle forms a polygonal shape, representing a sequence of thermodynamic states.  

Both diagrams are qualitative and do not include numerical values or specific equations. They visually describe the thermodynamic processes occurring in the system.
