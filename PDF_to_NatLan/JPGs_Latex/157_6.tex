TASK 3d  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is given as \( 0.003^\circ \text{C} \), which equals \( T_{\text{EW}} \). The mass of the ice-water mixture is \( m_{\text{EW}} = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \).  

The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q_{12}
\]  

The change in internal energy is:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12}
\]  

The internal energy \( U_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
U_1 = -0.045 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + x_{\text{ice},1} \left( -333.458 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + 0.045 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \right) = -200.09 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The total internal energy at state 1 is:  
\[
U_1 = U_1 \cdot m_{\text{EW}} = -20 \, \text{kJ} = -20,000 \, \text{J}
\]  

The internal energy at state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
U_2 = Q_{12} + U_1 = -17,954.16435 \, \text{J} = -17.95 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The specific internal energy at state 2 is:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{U_2}{m_{\text{EW}}} = -179.546 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The internal energy at state 2 is expressed as:  
\[
U_2 = U_{\text{fl}} (0.003^\circ \text{C}) + x_{\text{ice},2} \left( U_{\text{fest}} - U_{\text{fl}} \right)
\]  

Solving for the ice fraction at state 2:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{U_2 - U_{\text{fl}}}{U_{\text{fest}} - U_{\text{fl}}}
\]  

The final ice fraction is:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.5384 \approx 0.538
\]
