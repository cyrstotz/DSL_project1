TASK 1a  
The heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) is calculated using the energy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_K \left[ h_2 - h_a \right] + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  
where \( h_e = h(70^\circ) \) and \( h_a = h(100^\circ) \).

TASK 1b  
The entropy balance equation is expressed as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ s_e - s_a \right] + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]

TASK 1c  
The entropy production rate \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \dot{m} \left[ s_e - s_a \right] - \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_j}
\]  
where \( T_j = 1 \, \text{K} \).  
The result is given as \( 0.220 \, \text{kW/K} \).
