The internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
u_2 = u(0^\circ\text{C}) = -200.0328 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The formula for \( u_2 \) is expanded as:  
\[
u_2 = x \cdot u_{\text{frost}} + (1 - x) \cdot u_{\text{liquid}}
\]  
where \( x \) is the ice mass fraction, \( u_{\text{frost}} \) is the internal energy of ice, and \( u_{\text{liquid}} \) is the internal energy of liquid water.  

Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = x \cdot u_{\text{frost}} + (1 - x) \cdot u_{\text{liquid}} = x \cdot (-200.0328) + (1 - x) \cdot 223.127 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The equation is rearranged to solve for \( x \):  
\[
x = \frac{u_2 - u_{\text{liquid}}}{u_{\text{frost}} - u_{\text{liquid}}}
\]  

Substituting the values:  
\[
x = \frac{-200.0328 - 223.127}{-200.0328 - 223.127}
\]  

The result is approximately:  
\[
x = 0.0669
\]  

Additional notes:  
The temperature is \( T = 0^\circ\text{C} \), and the pressure is \( p = 1 \, \text{bar} \). There is a comment indicating that somewhere an error in \( x \) might have occurred, leading to a negative value.
