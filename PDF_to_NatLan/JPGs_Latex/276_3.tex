TASK 2c  
The calculation begins with the expression for the change in flow exergy:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = \left[ h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + ke_6 \right]
\]  
where:  
- \( h_6 - h_0 = c_p [T_6 - T_0] \)  
- \( s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) \)  
- \( ke_6 = \frac{1}{2} w_6^2 \)  

Additional assumptions:  
- The process is isobaric, and \( p_6 = p_0 \).  

The ambient temperature is given as \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} = 243.15 \, \text{K} \).  

Substituting the values into the equation:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = c_p \left[ T_6 - T_0 \right] - T_0 \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) + \frac{1}{2} w_6^2
\]  
The result is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = 13,084 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

TASK 2d  
The calculation for exergy destruction begins with the formula:  
\[
ex_{\text{verl}} = \frac{\dot{S}_{\text{erz}} - T_0}{m_{\text{gas}}}
\]  

Entropy balance:  
The entropy generation rate \( \dot{S}_{\text{erz}} \) is derived from:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{erz}} = \dot{m} \left[ s_6 - s_0 \right]
\]  
where \( s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) \).  

After substituting all values and performing the calculations, the final result is:  
\[
ex_{\text{verl}} = 82.01 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
