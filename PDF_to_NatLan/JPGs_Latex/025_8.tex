TASK 3b  
The temperature of the gas at state 2, \( T_{g,2} \), is equal to the temperature of the ice-water mixture, \( T_{\text{EW}} \), at state 2. This is due to thermal equilibrium between the gas and the ice-water mixture.  

TASK 3c  
The heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture, \( Q_{12} \), is calculated using the equation:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_{g,1} - T_{g,2})
\]  
where \( m_g \) is the mass of the gas, \( c_V \) is the specific heat capacity at constant volume, \( T_{g,1} \) is the initial temperature of the gas, and \( T_{g,2} \) is the final temperature of the gas.  

TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction, \( x_{\text{ice},2} \), is determined using the heat balance equation:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot \Delta h_{\text{fusion}} \cdot (x_{\text{ice},1} - x_{\text{ice},2})
\]  
where \( m_{\text{EW}} \) is the mass of the ice-water mixture, \( \Delta h_{\text{fusion}} \) is the enthalpy of fusion, \( x_{\text{ice},1} \) is the initial ice fraction, and \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is the final ice fraction.  

Additional notes:  
- \( T_{\text{EW},2} = 19.2^\circ\text{C} \) is written as the final temperature of the ice-water mixture.  
- The equation \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} \) is reiterated to emphasize thermal equilibrium.
