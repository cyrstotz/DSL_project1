TASK 4a  
Two graphs are drawn:  
1. The first graph is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram. It shows a dome-shaped curve representing phase regions. The x-axis is labeled \(T(K)\), and the y-axis is labeled \(p\). There are lines crossing the dome, likely indicating isobaric or isothermal processes.  
2. The second graph is also a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram, but it focuses on a single curve. The x-axis is labeled \(T(K)\), and the y-axis is labeled \(p\). A point \(z\) is marked on the curve, with an arrow pointing downward from \(T\) to \(z\).  

TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \(x_1\) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance (\(\epsilon_K\)) is given as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  

TASK 4b  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE^{o}}{dt} = \dot{m}_K (h_2 - h_a) + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
Rearranged to solve for \(-\dot{Q}_K\):  
\[
-\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m}_K \frac{(h_2 - h_f)}{(h_2 - h_g)}
\]  
From the tables, \(h_z\) is determined:  
\[
h_z = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 83.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
For \(h_2\):  
\[
h_2 = h_g(T_i) = 256.36 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

TASK 4  
\(T_2 = -20^\circ\text{C}\)
