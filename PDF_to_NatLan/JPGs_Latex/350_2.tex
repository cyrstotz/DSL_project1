TASK 2a  
The page contains multiple diagrams illustrating the thermodynamic processes of a jet engine in a temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(s\)) diagram.  

1. The first diagram shows several isobars labeled \(p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}\), \(p = 0.5 \, \text{bar}\), and \(p = p_2 = p_3\). The process begins at state \(0\) and progresses through states \(1\), \(2\), \(5\), and \(6\). The paths between states are labeled as isentropic or isobaric, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  

2. The second diagram zooms into the region between states \(5\) and \(6\), showing the isobar \(p = 0.5 \, \text{bar}\) and the isobar \(p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}\). The entropy axis (\(s\)) is labeled in \(\text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K}\), and the temperature axis (\(T\)) is labeled in Kelvin (\(K\)).  

3. The third diagram provides a three-dimensional perspective of the thermodynamic processes, with states \(5\) and \(6\) highlighted. It includes isentropic and isobaric paths and labels the pressure values.

TASK 2b  
The energy balance is applied between states \(5\) and \(6\).  

To determine \(T_6\), the polytropic exponent is used:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

The energy balance over states \(5\) and \(6\) is written as:  
\[
m \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{220^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right) = 0
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
h_5 - h_6 + \frac{220^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} = 0
\]  

Using \(h_5 - h_6 = c_p (T_5 - T_6)\):  
\[
1.006 \cdot 1000 \cdot (431.9 - 328.07) + \frac{220^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} = 0
\]  

Solving for \(w_6\):  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot 128651.93} = 507.25 \, \text{m/s}
\]  

Final results:  
- \(T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K}\)  
- \(w_6 = 507.25 \, \text{m/s}\)
