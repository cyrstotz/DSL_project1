TASK 3d  
The energy balance for the system is written as:  
\[
m_E \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Rearranging to solve for \( u_2 \):  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q_{12}}{m_E} + u_1
\]  

The specific internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
u_2 = x_{E,2} \cdot u_{FE} + (1 - x_{E,2}) \cdot u_{E}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = -200.1 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Since the temperature \( T \) does not change, the phase equilibrium condition applies. The equation for \( u_2 \) becomes:  
\[
u_2 = x_{E,2} \cdot u_{FE} + (1 - x_{E,2}) \cdot u_{E}
\]  

Given:  
\[
u_{FE} = 2500 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad u_{E} = -283.1 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The ice fraction \( x_{E,2} \) is calculated using:  
\[
x_{E,2} = \frac{u_2 - u_{E}}{u_{FE} - u_{E}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_{E,2} = \frac{-200.1 - (-283.1)}{2500 - (-283.1)} = 0.055
\]
