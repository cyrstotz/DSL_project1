TASK 4b  
The problem involves a stationary flow process. The energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
Rearranging for the refrigerant mass flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = -\frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

Additional conditions are specified:  
\[
s_2 = s_3
\]  
\[
p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]  
\[
x_2 = 1
\]  
\[
p_2 = p_4
\]  
The temperature at state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_2 = T_i - 6 \, \text{K}
\]
