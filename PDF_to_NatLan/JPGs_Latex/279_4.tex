TASK 3a  
The area of the cylinder is calculated as:  
\[
A_{\text{Zylinder}} = 0.1^2 \cdot \pi = 0.0314 \, \text{m}^2
\]  

The pressure is given as:  
\[
p = \frac{N}{\text{m}^2}
\]  

The external force acting on the cylinder is calculated as:  
\[
F_{\text{aussen}} = 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \cdot 0.0314 \, \text{m}^2 + 32 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 3455.5 \, \text{N}
\]  

The force exerted by the piston is:  
\[
F_{\text{innen}} \cdot A_{\text{Zylinder}} = 3455.5 \, \text{N}
\]  

The gas pressure is calculated as:  
\[
p_{\text{g,1}} = 1.1 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The molar mass of the gas is:  
\[
M = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol}
\]  

The specific gas constant is:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M} = \frac{8314}{50} = 166.28 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

Using the ideal gas law, the mass of the gas is calculated as:  
\[
\frac{p \cdot V}{R \cdot T} = m_{\text{g,1}} = 2.687 \, \text{g}
\]

TASK 3b  
The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{E}_{12} = \dot{E}_{12,w}
\]  

The heat transferred between states is:  
\[
m_{\text{g}} \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = \dot{E}_{12,w} = m_w \cdot (u_2 - u_1)
\]
