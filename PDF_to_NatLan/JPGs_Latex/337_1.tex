TASK 1c  
The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen},2} \) is to be determined. Starting with the entropy balance equation:  
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = \dot{m}_{\text{KF}} (h_e - h_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen},2}
\]  
Since the system is in steady state, \( \frac{dS}{dt} = 0 \). Rearranging for \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen},2} \):  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen},2} = \dot{m} (h_a - h_e) - \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}}
\]  

The enthalpy values \( h_a \) and \( h_e \) are calculated using:  
\[
h_a(298.15 \, \text{K}) = h_f(T_a) + v_f(T_a) \cdot (p - p_{\text{sat}}(T))
\]  
\[
h_e(288.15 \, \text{K}) = h_f(T_e) + v_f(T_e) \cdot (p - p_{\text{sat}}(T))
\]  

The change in enthalpy \( \Delta h \) is given by:  
\[
\Delta h = h_f(T_2) - h_f(T_a) = c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_a)
\]  

A diagram is included showing the heat transfer process between the reactor and the cooling jacket. The coolant enters at \( 288.15 \, \text{K} \) and exits at \( 298.15 \, \text{K} \). The heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) is labeled as \( 65 \, \text{kW} \), and the mean temperature of the coolant \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is \( 295 \, \text{K} \).

TASK 1d  
The energy balance equation is used to determine the mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) added to the reactor:  
\[
\Delta E = Q - W = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1
\]  
Since \( W = 0 \) and \( v = \text{const} \), the equation simplifies to:  
\[
m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m \cdot h_f(20^\circ\text{C}) + Q_R
\]  

The total mass at state 2 is:  
\[
m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m
\]  

At state 2, \( x_2 = 0 \), \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \), and the specific internal energy \( u_4(70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.95 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) (from Table A-2).  

A small sketch is included showing the heat flow \( Q_R = 35 \, \text{MJ} \).

TASK 1e  
The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S = S_2 - S_1 = m_2 S_2 - m_1 S_1 = \Delta m \cdot S(20^\circ\text{C}) + \frac{Q}{T} + S_{\text{gen}}
\]  

This equation accounts for the added mass, heat transfer, and entropy generation during the cooling process.
