TASK 2a  
A temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(s\)) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and isentropes. The states are marked as follows:  
- State 0 is the ambient condition.  
- State 1 is the inlet to the compressor.  
- State 2 is the outlet of the compressor.  
- State 3 is the combustion chamber outlet.  
- State 4 is the turbine outlet.  
- State 5 is the mixing chamber outlet.  
- State 6 is the nozzle exit.  

The isentropic processes are shown as vertical lines, while the isobaric processes are depicted as horizontal curves.  

TASK 2b  
The ambient pressure is given as \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), the ambient temperature as \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} \), and the ambient entropy as \( s_0 \).  

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific exergy destruction in the jet engine is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{E}_{\text{exergy, dest}} = \dot{m} \left[ h - h_0 - T_0 (s - s_0) \right]
\]  
Where:  
- \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate.  
- \( h \) and \( h_0 \) are the specific enthalpies at the current state and ambient state, respectively.  
- \( s \) and \( s_0 \) are the specific entropies at the current state and ambient state, respectively.  
- \( T_0 \) is the ambient temperature.
