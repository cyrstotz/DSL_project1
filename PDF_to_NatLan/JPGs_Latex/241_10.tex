The initial temperature \( T_i \) is given as \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The temperature after a 6 K reduction is calculated as:  
\[
T_1 = T_i - 6 \, \text{K} = 267.15 \, \text{K} \, (-6^\circ\text{C})
\]  

From Table A-11, the enthalpy of saturated liquid at 8 bar is:  
\[
h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 93.142 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
The enthalpy at state 4 is equal to \( h_f \):  
\[
h_4 = h_f
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{m - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
From Table A-10 at \( -6^\circ\text{C} \):  
\[
h_f(-6^\circ\text{C}) = 361.935 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(interpolated)}
\]  
\[
h_g(-6^\circ\text{C}) = 243.72 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The pressure \( p_4 \) is calculated using interpolation:  
\[
p_4 = 2.5274 + x \cdot (2.5274 - 2.1704) \, \text{bar}
\]  
\[
p_4 = 2.1704 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Finally, it is noted that:  
\[
p_1 = p_2
\]
