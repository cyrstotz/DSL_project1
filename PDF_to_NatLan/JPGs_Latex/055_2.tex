TASK 2a  
The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram representing the jet engine process. It includes labeled isobars and states:  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_4 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_1 = p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The entropy \( s_1 = s_2 \) is constant for the compression process.  
- The combustion process increases entropy, transitioning from state 3 to state 4.  
- The turbine process reduces entropy from state 4 to state 5.  
- The nozzle process transitions from state 5 to state 6, where \( p_6 = p_0 \).  

The diagram also shows temperature values:  
- \( T_1 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \), \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  
- The process paths are drawn qualitatively, with arrows indicating the direction of flow.  

A table is included with columns labeled \( p \), \( T \), \( v \), \( \dot{Q} \), and \( \dot{W} \). It lists values for states 1 through 6, with some entries left blank.  

Additional notes mention:  
- \( w_{\text{out}} = 200 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- \( \eta_{\text{vs}} < 1 \).

TASK 2b  
The energy balance equation for the jet engine is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} + g(z_e - z_a) \right] + \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}.
\]  
For the process from state 5 to state 6 (isentropic):  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right] + 0 - 0.
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{220^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right].
\]  

To find \( h_5 - h_6 \):  
- Air is modeled as an ideal gas with \( c_p = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \).  
- For the isentropic process from state 5 to state 6, \( n = k = 1.4 \):  
\[
h(T_5) - h(T_6) = c_p \cdot (T_5 - T_6).
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
h(T_5) - h(T_6) = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \cdot (431.9 - T_6).
\]

TASK 2b (continued)  
The equation is rewritten for the entire system from state 0 to state 6:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} + g(z_e - z_a) \right] + \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}.
\]  
Substituting \( h_6 = h_5 - c_p \cdot (T_5 - T_6) \):  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot \left[ h(243.15) - h(T_6) + \frac{200^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right].
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot \left[ 1.006 \cdot (243.15 - T_6) + \frac{220^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right].
\]  

The equations are structured to solve for \( T_6 \) and \( w_6 \).
