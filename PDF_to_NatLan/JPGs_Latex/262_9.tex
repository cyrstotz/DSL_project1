TASK 2b  
The task involves calculating the outlet velocity \( w_6 \) and temperature \( T_6 \) for the jet engine, as well as determining the exergy destruction.

The stationary exergy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_e - \ldots \right) + \dot{Q} e_{x,Q} - W_{\text{turbine}} - \dot{e}_{x,\text{fuel}}
\]  
where \( e_{x,\text{fuel}} \) represents the exergy destruction due to fuel combustion.  

The exergy destruction is expressed as:  
\[
e_{x,\text{fuel}} = \Delta e_{x,\text{stream},6} + e_{x,Q,6} - W_{\text{turbine}}
\]  
Simplifying further:  
\[
e_{x,\text{fuel}} = \Delta e_{x,\text{stream},6} - W_{\text{turbine}}
\]  

For the turbine, the work \( W_{\text{turbine}} \) is calculated using:  
\[
W_{\text{turbine}} = -n \cdot R \cdot \frac{T_6 - T_5}{1 - n}
\]  
where \( n \) is the efficiency factor, \( R \) is the specific gas constant, \( T_6 \) is the outlet temperature, and \( T_5 \) is the inlet temperature.  

The value of \( W_{\text{turbine}} \) is given as:  
\[
W_{\text{turbine}} = -109260.9 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Finally, the exergy destruction is calculated as:  
\[
e_{x,\text{fuel}} = 100 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + 109260.9 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
Resulting in:  
\[
e_{x,\text{fuel}} = 204.26 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
