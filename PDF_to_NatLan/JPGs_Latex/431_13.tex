TASK 4c  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f(40^\circ\text{C})}{h_g(40^\circ\text{C}) - h_f(40^\circ\text{C})}
\]  
From the table (Tab A10), the result is:  
\[
x_1 = 0.139
\]

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  

Using the energy balance for the system:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
Rearranging to find \( \dot{Q}_K \):  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m}_R (h_2 - h_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = 156.25 \, \text{W}
\]  

The enthalpy values are:  
\[
h_1 = h_q
\]  
\[
h_2 = h_g(-22^\circ\text{C}) = 259.08 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(from Tab A10)}
\]  

The coefficient of performance is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = 5.58
\]

TASK 4e  
The temperature would decrease because heat is continuously removed from the system. As a result, all components must adjust to reach a lower equilibrium temperature.
