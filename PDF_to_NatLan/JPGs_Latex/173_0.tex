TASK 2a  
The page begins with a graph illustrating the thermodynamic process in a jet engine. The graph is a \( T \)-\( S \) diagram (temperature vs. entropy) with labeled isobars and states. The following features are visible:  
- States 0 through 6 are marked along the process path.  
- Isobars are labeled as \( p_0 = p_6 \), \( p_2 = p_3 \), and \( p_4 = p_5 \).  
- The process includes compression, combustion, and expansion stages, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  

TASK 2b  
The following equation is written for energy conservation:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m} \left( h + ke + pe \right) + \sum \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}
\]  
This is simplified to:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2}{2} - \frac{w_a^2}{2} \right)
\]  
The outlet velocity \( w_e \) is calculated using:  
\[
w_e = \sqrt{2 \left( h_e - h_a + \frac{w_a^2}{2} \right)}
\]  

Values for \( h_e \) are obtained from Table A-22:  
- \( X_1 = 240 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( X_2 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( X_3 = 250 \, \text{K} \)  

Interpolation is performed using the formula:  
\[
y = \frac{(X_2 - X_1)}{(Y_2 - Y_1)} \cdot (Y_3 - Y_1) + Y_1
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
y = \frac{243.15 - 240}{250 - 240} \cdot (250.05 - 240) + 240.02 = 243.77945 = h_e \, [\text{kJ/kg}]
\]  

Additional calculations include:  
- \( w_{\text{air}} = 200 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- \( Y_1 = 240.02 \)  
- \( Y_2 = 250.05 \)
