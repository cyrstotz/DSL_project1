TASK 2a  
The task involves drawing the process qualitatively in a temperature-entropy (\(T-s\)) diagram with labeled isobars and units on the axes.  

### Description of the \(T-s\) Diagram:  
The diagram shows a thermodynamic process with six states labeled \(0\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\).  
- The curve labeled "isobar" represents constant pressure lines.  
- The process transitions between states as follows:  
  - \(0 \to 2\): Isentropic compression (vertical line).  
  - \(2 \to 3\): Isobaric heat addition.  
  - \(3 \to 4\): Isentropic expansion.  
  - \(4 \to 5\): Isobaric mixing.  
  - \(5 \to 6\): Isentropic expansion.  

The pressures are labeled as follows:  
- \(p_0 = p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}\).  
- \(p_2 = p_3 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}\).  
- \(p_5 > p_0\).

### Energy Balance and Calculations:  
The energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_5 \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right) + \dot{Q} + \dot{W} = 0
\]  

The enthalpy difference between states \(5\) and \(6\) is expressed as:  
\[
h_5 - h_6 = c_p (T_5 - T_6)
\]  

The temperature \(T_6\) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} = 328.075 \, \text{K}
\]  

The outlet velocity \(w_6\) is calculated as:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{w_5^2 + 2 \cdot (h_5 - h_6)}
\]  

No further numerical values are provided for \(w_5\) or \(h_5 - h_6\).
