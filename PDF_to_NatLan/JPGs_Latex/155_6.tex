TASK 3b  
The ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice}} \) is defined as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice}} = \frac{m_{\text{ice}}}{m_{\text{EW}}}
\]  
It is stated that \( x_{\text{ice}} > 0 \), which implies \( m_{\text{ice}} \neq 0 \).  

The equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture in state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},2} = T_{g,2} = T_{\text{GGW}}
\]  

The energy balance equation is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \sum_j Q_j - \sum_n W_{\text{in}}
\]

TASK 3c  
The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the formula:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot \Delta T
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 3.65 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot (499.997 \, \text{K})
\]  
The result is:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1,139.4 \, \text{kJ}
\]

TASK 3d  
The final equilibrium temperature of the gas and ice-water mixture in state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{GGW}} = 0.003^\circ\text{C}
\]  

The internal energy of the ice-water mixture \( U_{\text{EW}} \) is left incomplete on the page.
