TASK 1a  
The page begins with a schematic diagram representing a system with heat transfer. The system is labeled as "adiabatic" with no heat transfer to the surroundings. Two heat flows are indicated: \( Q_{\text{out}} \) and \( Q_{\text{in}} \), both equal to \( 65 \, \text{kW} \).  

The entropy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \sum \dot{m}_i s_i + \sum \frac{\dot{Q}_i}{T_i} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  

The mean temperature in the reactor is given as \( \bar{T}_{\text{Reactor}} = 100^\circ\text{C} = 373.15 \, \text{K} \), and the coolant temperature is \( T_{\text{KF}} = 293.18 \, \text{K} \).  

The entropy production rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{Q_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}} - \frac{Q_{\text{in}}}{T_{\text{Reactor}}} = 65 \, \text{kW} \left( \frac{1}{293.18} - \frac{1}{373.15} \right)
\]  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 0.104 \, \text{kJ/sÂ·K}
\]  

TASK 1d  
The next section addresses the cooling process from state 1 to state 2.  

State 1:  
Mass \( m_{\text{total},1} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \), steam quality \( x = 0.005 \), temperature \( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \).  

State 2:  
Temperature \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \), steam quality \( x = 0 \). Heat released during cooling is \( Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \, \text{MJ} \).  

The system is described as "half-open," and the energy balance is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_i + Q_{12} - W_{\text{in}}
\]  

The mass at state 2 is expressed as:  
\[
m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12}
\]  

The internal energy values are calculated using water tables:  
\[
u_2 = U(70^\circ\text{C}, x = 0) = 292.45 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{[Table A2]}
\]  
\[
u_1 = U(100^\circ\text{C}, x = 0.005) = 418.36 + 0.005 (2586.5 - 418.36) = 429.37 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{[Table A2]}
\]  

The enthalpy at the inlet is:  
\[
h_i = h(20^\circ\text{C}, x = 0) = 83.36 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{[Table A2]}
\]  

The heat balance is summarized as:  
\[
\sum \dot{Q}_i = Q_{R,12} - Q_{\text{out},12} = 0
\]  

The page ends with a note indicating continuation on the next page.  

Description of Diagram:  
The diagram is a rectangular schematic with arrows labeled \( Q_{\text{out}} \) and \( Q_{\text{in}} \) pointing outward and inward, respectively. It represents heat transfer across a cooling wall.
