The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = \sum \dot{m} s + \sum \frac{Q}{T_j} + S_{\text{gen}}
\]  

This equation is further simplified to:  
\[
\Delta S = S_2 - S_1 = m (s_2 - s_1) = \sum \frac{Q}{T_j} + S_{\text{gen}}
\]  
where \( m = m_{\text{total},1} + \Delta m_{12} \).  

The total mass is calculated as:  
\[
m = 5755 + 3500 \, \text{kg} = 9355 \, \text{kg}
\]  

There are placeholders for entropy values \( S_2 \) and \( S_1 \), but no numerical values are provided.
