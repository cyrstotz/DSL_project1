TASK 1d  
The heat released during cooling is given as:  
\[
Q_{R,12} = Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \, \text{MJ}
\]

TASK 1e  
The entropy change of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m \cdot (s_2 - s_1)
\]  
The entropy difference \( s_2 - s_1 \) is calculated using the integral:  
\[
s_2 - s_1 = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \frac{c}{T} \, dT = c \cdot \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)
\]
