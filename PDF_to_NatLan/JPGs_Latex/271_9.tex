TASK {last_known_task}
The equation provided calculates \( u_1 \), which appears to be a specific internal energy value. The formula is as follows:

\[
u_1 = u_{\text{fest}} + x_1 \left( u_{\text{passing}} - u_{\text{fest}} \right)
\]

Substituting values:

\[
u_1 = -333,458 + 0.6 \left( -32,045 - (-333,458) \right) \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
u_1 = -333,410 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
