TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn with axes labeled \( p \) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \( T \) (temperature) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts a cycle with four numbered points (1, 2, 3, 4) connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process. The cycle appears to represent a thermodynamic process.

TASK 4b  
The energy balance for the compressor is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_k
\]  
Rearranging for the mass flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
It is noted that \( h_2 \) corresponds to \( h(10^\circ\text{C}, x = 0) \). Interpolation is performed using values:  
\[
233.63 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{and} \quad 237.46 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
Additional calculations involve:  
\[
9.2545 \quad \text{and} \quad 0.23534
\]

TASK 4c  
The throttling process is described as isentropic, meaning:  
\[
s_4 = s_3
\]  
The vapor quality \( x \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x = \frac{s_4 - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]
