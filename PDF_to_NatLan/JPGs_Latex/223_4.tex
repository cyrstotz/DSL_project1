TASK 3a  
The initial temperature of the gas is \( T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} \), and its initial volume is \( V_{g,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L} = 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3 \). The molar mass of the gas is \( M_g = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol} \), and the specific heat capacity at constant volume is \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg路K} \). The gas constant is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{R_u}{M_g} = \frac{8.314 \, \text{kJ/(kmol路K)}}{50 \, \text{kg/kmol}} = 0.16628 \, \text{kJ/(kg路K)}.
\]

Using the ideal gas law \( pV = RT \), the pressure is expressed as:  
\[
p = \frac{RT}{V}.
\]

The pressure balance is given as:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{m_K \cdot g}{\pi \cdot D^2} + \frac{32 \, \text{kg} \cdot g}{\pi \cdot D^2} + 1 \, \text{bar}.
\]

The calculated pressure is:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1 \, \text{bar} + 0.128 \, \text{bar} + 39 \, \text{mbar} = 1.167 \, \text{bar}.
\]

The mass of the gas is determined using:  
\[
m_{g,1} = \frac{R \cdot T_1}{p_1 \cdot V_1} = \frac{0.16628 \, \text{kJ/(kg路K)} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K}}{1.15 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \cdot 0.00314 \, \text{m}^3} = 0.772 \, \text{kg}.
\]

TASK 3b  
The pressure \( p_2 \) is equal to \( p_1 \), as the density and mass of the gas have not changed.

---

TASK 3c  
The energy balance between the ice-water mixture (EW) and the gas is expressed as:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12}.
\]

Expanding the energy balance:  
\[
m_g \cdot U_2 - m_g \cdot U_1 = Q_{12}.
\]

The heat transferred is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = 80.0036 \, \text{kg} \cdot \left[ u(0.0034 \, \text{m}^3, 1.15 \, \text{bar}) - u(500^\circ\text{C}, 1 \, \text{bar}) \right].
