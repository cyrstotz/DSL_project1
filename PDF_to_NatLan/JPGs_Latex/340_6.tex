TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]

The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_K \) is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} \cdot \frac{u_2 - u_1}{\mu} + \dot{m} \cdot \frac{u_4 - u_3}{\mu}
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = 0.000837 \cdot \left( 212.7 - 93.52 \right) + 120.683 \, \text{J/s}
\]

The coefficient of performance is then calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{120.3163}{28.0} = 4.30
\]
