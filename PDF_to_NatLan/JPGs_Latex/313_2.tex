TASK 2a  
A qualitative \( T \)-\( S \) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process paths:  
- An **adiabatic, irreversible nozzle reaction** is shown.  
- An **adiabatic, reversible compression** process is labeled.  
- An **isobaric heat addition** process is indicated.  
- The diagram also includes points labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), and \( 6 \), corresponding to different states in the engine cycle.  
- The curve for **adiabatic expansion with \( \eta < 1 \)** is drawn.  
- The axes are labeled \( T \) (temperature) and \( S \) (entropy).  

TASK 2b  
The following calculations are performed for the outlet temperature \( T_6 \):  
\[
p_0 = p_6
\]
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]
Where \( n = \kappa = 1.4 \), \( p_0 = 15100 \, \text{Pa} \), and \( p_5 = 50000 \, \text{Pa} \). Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 323.07 \, \text{K}
\]

The energy balance equation is written:  
\[
0 = h_c - h_a + \frac{w_c^2 - w_a^2}{2}
\]
The specific heat equation is used:  
\[
c = c_p (T_c - T_a) + \frac{w_c^2 - w_a^2}{2}
\]
The work output is calculated:  
\[
w_c = 507.23 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\]

It is noted that the **adiabatic nozzle produces no work**.  

TASK 2c  
The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is calculated using the formula:  
\[
ex_{6,sf} = h_e - h_a - T_0(S_e - S_a) + \Delta ke
\]
Substituting terms:  
\[
= c_p (T_e - T_a) - T_e \left( S_e - \frac{c_p}{T} \right) + \Delta ke
\]
\[
= 2c (q_c Q_c) \frac{c_p}{k_8}
\]
It is noted that \( \ln(n) = 0 \).
