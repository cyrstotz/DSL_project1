TASK 3c  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}
\]  

The change in energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q_{12} - W_v
\]  

The work done is calculated using:  
\[
W = \int_{1}^{2} p \, dv = p(V_2 - V_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
W = 1.907 \cdot (3.744 - 1.709) = 284.54 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The volume \( V_2 \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m \cdot R \cdot T}{p}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{0.00342 \cdot 273.15}{0.94629} = 7.109 \, \text{L}
\]  

The change in internal energy is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta E = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta E = 0.342 \cdot 0.633 \cdot (500) = 7.08 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The total heat transfer is calculated as:  
\[
Q = \Delta E + W
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
Q = 7.08 + 0.97 = 2.055 \, \text{kJ}
\]

TASK 3d  
The pressure exerted by the piston and the ice-water mixture is calculated as:  
\[
p = \frac{m_K \cdot g}{A_{\text{EW}}} = \frac{32 \cdot 9.81}{\pi \cdot (5 \, \text{cm})^2}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
p = 7.0 \, \text{kPa} + p_{\text{atm}} = 1.48 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = \sum Q - \sum W
\]  

The specific internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated using:  
\[
u_2 = u_c + x \cdot (u_g - u_f)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = -200.39 + x \cdot (-407.98 - (-200.39))
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  

Solving for \( u_2 \):  
\[
u_2 = -200.39 + \frac{-200.398 + 333.458}{0.045 + 3.33458} = 0.40
\]  

The final ice fraction is approximately:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 40\%
\]
