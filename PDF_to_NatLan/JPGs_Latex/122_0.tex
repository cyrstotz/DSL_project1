TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{R_g T_1}{m_g V_1}
\]  
The specific gas constant \( R_g \) is determined as:  
\[
R_g = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g} = 0.166285944 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

The force exerted by the piston \( F_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
F_K = m_K \cdot g = 32 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 313.813 \, \text{N}
\]  

The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the cylinder is:  
\[
A = \pi \cdot \frac{D^2}{4} = \pi \cdot \frac{(0.1 \, \text{m})^2}{4} = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  

The pressure contribution from the ice-water mixture \( F_{\text{EW}} \) is:  
\[
F_{\text{EW}} = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot g = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 0.981 \, \text{N}
\]  

The total gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is then:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{F_K + F_{\text{EW}}}{A} = \frac{313.813 \, \text{N} + 0.981 \, \text{N}}{0.00785 \, \text{m}^2} = 140080.8163 \, \text{Pa} = 1.4008 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas mass \( m_g \) is calculated as:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_1}{R_g T_1} = \frac{1.4008 \, \text{bar} \cdot 3.14 \, \text{L}}{0.166285944 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \cdot 500^\circ\text{C}} = 3.42 \, \text{g}
\]  

TASK 3b  
The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) in state 2 remains the same as \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4008 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to the equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

TASK 3c  
In state 2, there is no further heat exchange, and the ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \). Therefore, the temperature of the ice-water mixture remains constant at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The pressure does not change in the gas because the substances remain in equilibrium. The gas temperature adjusts to match the temperature of the water, as no heat exchange occurs in state 2.
