TASK 3a  
The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) are determined using the following relationships:  

1. The forces acting on the piston are balanced, as shown in the diagram. The piston is fixed at point A, and the forces include the weight of the piston and the pressure exerted by the gas and the ice-water mixture.  

\[
p_{g,1} = g \left( m_K + m_{\text{EW}} \right) + p_{\text{amb}}
\]

The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is calculated as:  
\[
A = \pi \frac{D^2}{4}
\]

Substituting into the equation for \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{g \left( m_K + m_{\text{EW}} \right)}{\pi \frac{D^2}{4}} + p_{\text{amb}}
\]

2. The gas mass \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_A V_A = m_g R T_A
\]

Rearranging:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_A V_A}{R T_A}
\]

The specific gas constant \( R \) is derived as:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g} = \frac{8.314 \, \text{kJ/kmol·K}}{50 \, \text{kg/kmol}} = 0.166 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]

TASK 3b  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined under the assumption that \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), meaning ice is still present in the system.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is exactly equal to the equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture, which is \( T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} \). Thermal equilibrium is achieved, and no further heat transfer occurs.  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) remains constant because the piston weight and atmospheric pressure remain unchanged, and the system is isolated.  

TASK 3c  
The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
\Delta E_{1 \to 2} = \dot{Q} + \dot{W}
\]

Since work is negligible, the heat transfer is expressed as:  
\[
Q = \Delta E = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_{2,g} - T_{1,g})
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
Q = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_{2,g} - T_{1,g})
\]

\[
Q = 0.03643 \cdot 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \cdot (0 - 500^\circ\text{C})
\]

\[
Q = -11.53927 \, \text{kJ} = -11.539 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

This represents the heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture.
