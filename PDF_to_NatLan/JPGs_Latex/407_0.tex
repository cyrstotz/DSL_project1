TASK 1a  
The equation for energy balance is written as:  
\[
\dot{Q}^* = \dot{Q}_{\text{in}} + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{W}
\]  
The mass flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = \dot{Q}_R - \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  

TASK 1b  
The thermodynamic mean temperature \( \bar{T} \) is calculated using the following integral expression:  
\[
\bar{T} = \frac{\int_{s_e}^{s_n} T \, ds}{s_n - s_e} = \frac{h_n - h_e}{s_n - s_e}
\]
