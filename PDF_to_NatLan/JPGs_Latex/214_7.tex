TASK 3c  
The heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the formula:  
\[
Q_{1 \to 2} = m_g \cdot c_p \cdot (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1})
\]  
where \( c_p = k \cdot c_V = 0.8 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} \).  

Substituting the values:  
\[
Q_{1 \to 2} = 3.6 \, \text{g} \cdot 0.8 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} \cdot (0.003^\circ\text{C} - 500^\circ\text{C})
\]  
\[
Q_{1 \to 2} = -1.44 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

TASK 3d  
The equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture in state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_{\text{EW,2}} = T_{g,2} = 0.003^\circ\text{C}
\]
