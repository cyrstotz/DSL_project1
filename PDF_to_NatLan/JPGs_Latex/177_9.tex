TASK 4a  
The graph depicts a pressure-temperature (\(P\)-\(T\)) diagram. The curve represents the phase boundary between different states of the refrigerant. The critical point (\(T_c\)) is marked at the peak of the curve.  

The temperature \(T_i\) is given as \(-20^\circ\text{C}\).  

Additional notes:  
- \(1 \, \text{mbar} = 0.001 \, \text{bar}\)  
- \(1 \, \text{mm} = 0.001\)  

Description of the graph:  
The graph shows a bell-shaped curve on a \(P\)-\(T\) diagram. The x-axis represents temperature (\(T\)), and the y-axis represents pressure (\(P\)). The curve starts at low pressure and temperature, rises to a maximum at the critical point (\(T_c\)), and then decreases again.
