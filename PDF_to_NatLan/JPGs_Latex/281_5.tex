TASK 2c  
The expression for the mass-specific increase in flow exergy is given as:  
\[
\dot{ex}_{\text{flow},6} = \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \left[ (u_6 - u_5) - T_0 (s_6 - s_5) + \frac{1}{2} w_6^2 \right]
\]  

An alternative form of the equation is partially crossed out and not considered.  

TASK 2d  
The expression for exergy destruction is:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]
