TASK 2a  
The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process.  

- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( s \) (specific entropy) with units \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  

The diagram includes:  
1. Several curved lines labeled "Isobare," representing constant pressure processes.  
2. A process path with distinct segments:  
   - Starting at \( 1 \), moving upward and curving to \( 2 \).  
   - A sharp transition to \( 3 \), followed by a downward curve to \( 4 \).  
   - Ending at \( 5 \), with a slight curve to \( 6 \).  

Additional annotations:  
- \( \eta_s = 1/4 \) is written near one of the process paths.  
- \( v \to c \) is noted near the final segment.  

This diagram qualitatively illustrates the thermodynamic processes in the jet engine, including compression, combustion, and expansion stages.
