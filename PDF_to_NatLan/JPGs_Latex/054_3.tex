TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (\(p-T\)) diagram. The curve represents the freeze-drying process. Key points are labeled as \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), and \(4\).  
- **State 2**: The refrigerant is in the vapor phase.  
- **State 4**: The refrigerant is in the liquid phase.  
- \(p_1 = p_2\)  
- \(p_3 = p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar}\)  

TASK 4b  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K
\]  
The mass flow rate is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
Interpolation is required to determine \(h_2\) and \(h_3\).  
\[
h_2 = 261.43 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

TASK 4c  
It is stated that \(h_4 = h_4\), implying \(T_4 = T_u\).  
\[
h_4 = 721.11 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance (\(\epsilon_K\)) is calculated using:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]
