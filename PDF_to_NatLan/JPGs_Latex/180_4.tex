TASK 3a  
The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_K g}{A} + \frac{m_{\text{EW}} g}{A}
\]  
The area \( A \) is determined as:  
\[
A = \pi r^2 = 0.0314
\]  
Substituting values, \( p_{g,1} \) is found to be:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 2 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The mass \( m \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p V = m R T \quad \Rightarrow \quad m = \frac{p V}{R T} = 1.75
\]

TASK 3b  
The final state is described as:  
"Both systems do not exchange heat anymore."

TASK 3c  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
U_{\text{end}} - U_g - U_{\text{EW}} = 0
\]  
This equation is crossed out and replaced with:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12}
\]  
The relationship for \( U_2 \) is given as:  
\[
U_2 = m(U_f - U_i) + Q
\]  
This expression is incomplete.

TASK 3d  
The ice fraction \( x \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x = \frac{S_2 - S_f}{S_i - S_f} = \frac{U_2 - U_f}{U_i - U_f}
\]  

The internal energy \( U_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
U_2 = m_g U_g + c_V \Delta T
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
U_{g,1} = -0.2954 \times (U_f - U_i) = -220.1168
\]  
\[
U_2 = -220.144
\]  
\[
U_f = -0.033 \quad \text{and} \quad U_f = -333.442
\]  

The final ice fraction \( x \) is determined as:  
\[
x = 0.160015 \quad \text{or} \quad 0.16002
\]
