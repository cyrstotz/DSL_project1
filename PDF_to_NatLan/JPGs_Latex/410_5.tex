TASK 4a  
A graph is drawn showing pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis (labeled in bar) and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis (labeled in Kelvin). The graph depicts a typical phase diagram with a dome-shaped curve. Points 1, 2, and 3 are marked on the diagram, with arrows indicating transitions between states.  

TASK 4b  
The equation for heat transfer is given as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K
\]  
The mass flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
It is noted that \( h_3 \) can be interpolated using \( s_3 \).  

TASK 4c  
The enthalpy \( h_3 \) is calculated as:  
\[
h_3 = x h_{3g} + (1 - x) h_{3f}
\]  
The value of \( h_4 \) is provided as:  
\[
h_4 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \, \text{(from table)}
\]  

TASK 4d  
The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
The heat transfer \( Q_K \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q_K = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_1)
\]
