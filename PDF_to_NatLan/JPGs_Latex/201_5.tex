TASK 2a  
The page contains mathematical derivations and calculations related to jet engine exergy analysis. Below is the transcription of the visible content:

1. The equation for the outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is derived:
\[
w_6^2 = w_5^2 + 2 \left( h_5 - h_6 \right)
\]

2. The specific enthalpy difference is expressed:
\[
h_5 - h_6 = c_p \left( T_5 - T_6 \right)
\]

3. Substituting into the velocity equation:
\[
w_6^2 = w_5^2 + 2 c_p \left( T_5 - T_6 \right)
\]

4. The mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated:
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_{\text{flow},6} - ex_{\text{flow},0}
\]

5. The flow exergy at state 6 is expressed:
\[
ex_{\text{flow},6} = \frac{w_6^2}{2} + c_p \left( T_6 - T_0 - T_0 \ln \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right)
\]

6. The flow exergy at state 0 is given:
\[
ex_{\text{flow},0} = \frac{w_0^2}{2} + c_p \left( T_0 - T_0 \ln \frac{T_0}{T_0} \right)
\]

7. The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) in the engine is calculated:
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} - \left( \text{useful work output} \right)
\]

8. Additional calculations for \( w_6 \) and \( T_6 \) are shown:
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{w_5^2 + 2 c_p \left( T_5 - T_6 \right)}
\]

9. The entropy production term is derived:
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\dot{Q}}{T_{\text{mean}}}
\]
