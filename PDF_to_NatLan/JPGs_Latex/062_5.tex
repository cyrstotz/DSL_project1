TASK 2c  
The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
e_{K,6} - e_{K,0} = \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} + h_6 - h_0 - T_0(s_6 - s_0) + k_e,6 - k_e,0
\]  

The enthalpy difference \( h_6 - h_0 \) is calculated as:  
\[
h_6 - h_0 = c_p(T_6 - T_0) = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}} \cdot (431.9 \, \text{K} - 243.15 \, \text{K}) = 85.43 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The entropy difference \( s_6 - s_0 \) is calculated as:  
\[
s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln\left(\frac{T_6}{T_0}\right) - R \ln\left(\frac{p_6}{p_0}\right) = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}} \ln\left(\frac{431.9}{243.15}\right) - 0.30 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}} \ln\left(\frac{0.5}{0.191}\right)
\]  

The kinetic energy difference \( \Delta e_{\text{kin}} \) is given by:  
\[
\Delta e_{\text{kin}} = k_e,6 - k_e,0 = \frac{1}{2} w_6^2 - \frac{1}{2} w_0^2
\]  

The total mass-specific increase in flow exergy is then calculated as:  
\[
\Delta e_{K,\text{str}} = 85.43 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - 243.15 \, \text{K} \cdot (0.3 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}}) + \frac{(498.50 \, \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2} - 200 \, \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2})^2}{2}
\]  
\[
= 116.63 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

TASK 2d  
The mass flow rates are described as follows:  
\[
\dot{m}_M = 5.293 \cdot \dot{m}_K
\]  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{ges}} = \dot{m}_M + \dot{m}_K
\]  

A diagram is drawn showing the energy flow in the jet engine. It includes labeled arrows for \( \dot{W}_K \) (compressor work), \( \dot{W}_T \) (turbine work), and \( \dot{Q}_B \) (heat input in the combustion chamber). The bypass and core streams are also indicated.  

The exergy destruction is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{e}_{\text{dest}} = T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  

The exergy destruction occurs in the combustion chamber, turbine, mixing chamber, and nozzle.

Descriptions of diagrams:  
- The diagram shows a schematic representation of the jet engine process, with labeled components such as the compressor, turbine, and mixing chamber. Energy flows are indicated with arrows, and the bypass and core streams are clearly marked.
