TASK 3a  
The pressure of the gas in state 1 is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{m_g R T_{g,1}}{V_{g,1}}
\]  
where \( R \) is the specific gas constant, \( T_{g,1} \) is the temperature of the gas in state 1, \( V_{g,1} \) is the volume of the gas, and \( m_g \) is the mass of the gas.  

TASK 3b  
Given that \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), the temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) in state 2 are determined by thermal equilibrium with the ice-water mixture. The temperature remains at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), and the pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure \( p_{\text{amb}} \).  

TASK 3c  
The heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture between states 1 and 2 is calculated using:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_{g,1} - T_{g,2})
\]  
where \( c_V \) is the specific heat capacity at constant volume, \( T_{g,1} \) is the initial temperature of the gas, and \( T_{g,2} \) is the final temperature of the gas.  

TASK 3d  
The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) in state 2 is determined using the solid-liquid equilibrium table and the energy balance for the phase change.
