TASK 2b  
The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated using the following energy balance equation:  

\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_6 - h_5) + \dot{m} \frac{w_6^2 - w_5^2}{2}
\]

Rearranging the equation:  

\[
2(h_6 - h_5) = w_6^2 - w_5^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad w_6^2 = w_5^2 - 2(h_6 - h_5)
\]

The enthalpy difference \( h_6 - h_5 \) is calculated as:  

\[
(h_6 - h_5) = c_p (T_6 - T_5) = 1.006 \cdot (431.9 - 431.9) = -118.25
\]

Substituting into the velocity equation:  

\[
w_6 = \sqrt{220^2 - 2 \cdot 118.25} = 220.26 \, \text{m/s}
\]
