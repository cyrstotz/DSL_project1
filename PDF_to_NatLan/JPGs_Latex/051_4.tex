TASK 2c  
The expression for the exergy destruction is given as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = \left[ h - h_0 - T_0 (s - s_0) + ke \right]
\]  

TASK 2d  
The exergy destruction is calculated using:  
\[
ex_{\text{vel}} = T_0 \cdot \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
Further calculation steps are left incomplete.
