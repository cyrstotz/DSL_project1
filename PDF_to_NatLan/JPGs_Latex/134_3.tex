TASK 2c  
The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_{\text{flow},6} - ex_{\text{flow},0}
\]  
This is expanded as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = \dot{m} \left( h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2} \right)
\]  

The enthalpy difference \( h_6 - h_0 \) is calculated using:  
\[
h_6 - h_0 = c_p (T_6 - T_0) = 1.006 \cdot (431.925 - (-30)) = 85.435 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The entropy difference \( s_6 - s_0 \) is calculated using:  
\[
s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) = 1.006 \ln \left( \frac{431.925}{243.15} \right) - 0.301
\]  

The velocity term is calculated as:  
\[
\frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2} = \frac{220^2 - 200^2}{2}
\]  

Substituting all values:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = 85.435 - 243.75 \cdot 0.301 + \frac{220^2 - 200^2}{2}
\]  
The final result is:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = 42.887 + 110.062 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

TASK 2d  
The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = \text{Enter Exergiebilanz}
\]  

The solution involves:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} + ex_{\text{adiabat}} - \dot{W}_e = ex_{XX,\text{verl}}
\]  

The equation is incomplete, and no further numerical values are provided.
