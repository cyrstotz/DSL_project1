TASK 4b  
The required refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is calculated using the following energy balance for the compressor:  

\[
\dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{W}
\]

The steady-state flow process assumes negligible kinetic and potential energy changes (\( w_2^2 - w_3^2 = 0 \), \( z_2 - z_3 = 0 \)) and adiabatic operation. The energy equation simplifies to:  

\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{W}_K
\]

Rearranging for \( \dot{m} \):  

\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]

TASK 4c  
The entropy at state 2 equals the entropy at state 3 due to isentropic compression:  

\[
s_2 = s_3 \quad \text{(isentropic process)}
\]

At state \( A \), the vapor quality \( x_A = 0 \), and the enthalpy \( h_A \) is given as:  

\[
h_A = h_f (8 \, \text{bar}) = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(Table A-11)}
\]

TASK 4e  
The initial temperature \( T_i \) is calculated as:  

\[
T_i = T_{\text{subl}} + 70 \, \text{K} = 70 \, \text{K}
\]

For the heat transfer process:  

\[
T_2 = T_i - 6 \, \text{K} = 64 \, \text{K}
\]

The enthalpy at state 2 is:  

\[
h_2 = h_g (64 \, \text{K}) = h_g
\]

The temperature at state \( T_i \) is recalculated as:  

\[
T_i = T_{\text{subl}} + 70 \, \text{K} = 0^\circ \text{C} + 70 \, \text{K} = 70^\circ \text{C}
\]

The temperature difference yields:  

\[
T_2 = 70^\circ \text{C} - 30^\circ \text{C} = 40^\circ \text{C}
\]

The enthalpy at state 2 is:  

\[
h_2 = h_g (40^\circ \text{C}) = 194.19 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(Table A-10)}
\]

The entropy at state 3 is calculated using the saturated vapor and liquid entropy values:  

\[
s_3 = s_g (40^\circ \text{C}) = 0.9769 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]

The vapor quality \( x_3 \) at state 3 is determined as:  

\[
x_3 = \frac{s_3 - s_f (8 \, \text{bar})}{s_g (8 \, \text{bar}) - s_f (8 \, \text{bar})} = \frac{0.9769 - 0.3459}{0.9066 - 0.3459}
\]
