The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta U = Q_{12} - W_{12}^0
\]  
Since \( W_{12}^0 = 0 \), this simplifies to:  
\[
\Delta U = m_g \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Substituting \( u_2 - u_1 = c_V \cdot (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) \):  
\[
m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) = Q_{12}
\]  
With values:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1.083 \, \text{kJ}
\]
