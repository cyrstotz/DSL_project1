The mass-specific exergy destruction in the jet engine is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{E}_{\text{exergy, dest}} = \dot{m} \left[ h - h_0 - T_0 (s - s_0) \right]
\]  
Where:  
- \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate.  
- \( h \) and \( h_0 \) are the specific enthalpies at the current state and ambient state, respectively.  
- \( s \) and \( s_0 \) are the specific entropies at the current state and ambient state, respectively.  
- \( T_0 \) is the ambient temperature.
