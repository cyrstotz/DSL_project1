The energy balance for the process from state 1 to state 2 is written as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \left[ h_1 - h_2 \right] + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
It is further specified that:  
\[
h_2 = h_g(-22) = 234.8 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

For the process from state 2 to state 3, the energy balance is:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] - \dot{W}_K
\]
