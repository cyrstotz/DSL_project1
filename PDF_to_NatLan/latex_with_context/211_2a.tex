The process is illustrated qualitatively in a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars (\( p_0, p_2, p_4 \)) and isentropic processes. The states are marked as 1, 2, 3, and 4, with arrows indicating the transitions between states. The axes are labeled as "Temperature" on the vertical axis and "Entropy (\( s \)) [kJ/K]" on the horizontal axis.
