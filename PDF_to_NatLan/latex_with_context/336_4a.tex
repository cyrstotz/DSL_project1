A p-T diagram is drawn to represent the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes the following features:  
- The x-axis represents temperature \( T \) (in Kelvin), and the y-axis represents pressure \( p \) (in bar).  
- The diagram shows phase regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "gas."  
- The triple point is marked as a specific point where the three phases coexist.  
- An isothermal expansion process is indicated at the lower left, starting at 0.5 bar.  
- The process path includes isobaric cooling and transitions between phases.  
- A temperature difference \( \Delta T = 10 \, \text{K} \) is noted near the isothermal expansion.
