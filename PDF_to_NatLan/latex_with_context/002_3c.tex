The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
dU = Q - W
\]  
The change in internal energy is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
dU = 316.5 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The work done per unit mass is given by:  
\[
\frac{W}{m} = \int p \, dV
\]  
The specific work is calculated using the change in volume:  
\[
W = m p (V_2 - V_1)
\]  
Substituting values yields:  
\[
W = 0.972 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The final volume is determined using the ideal gas law:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m R T_2}{p_{g,2}}
\]  
Substituting values yields:  
\[
V_2 = 1.11 \, \text{L}
\]  

The total heat transferred is calculated as:  
\[
Q = dU + W
\]  
Substituting values yields:  
\[
Q = 2052 \, \text{J}
\]  

The total heat transferred is approximately:  
\[
Q = 108 \, \text{kJ}
\]
