A graph is drawn with pressure \( P \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The curve resembles a phase diagram with a peak labeled "KP" (likely the critical point). The left side of the curve represents the liquid phase, and the right side represents the vapor phase. Two steps are marked:  
- Step \( i \): A horizontal line moves from the liquid phase to the vapor phase, indicating isobaric evaporation.  
- Step \( ii \): A vertical line moves downward, indicating a reduction in pressure.
