A p-T diagram is drawn to represent the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes the following labeled points and processes:  
- Point 1: The starting state.  
- Point 2: Isobaric evaporation.  
- Point 3: Reversible adiabatic compression.  
- Point 4: Isobaric condensation.  
The diagram also shows the triple point of the refrigerant and the phase boundaries. The x-axis represents temperature \( T \) (in degrees Celsius), and the y-axis represents pressure \( p \). The processes are labeled as "isobar" and "adiabat" to indicate the thermodynamic paths.

The mass flow rate is given as:  
\[
\dot{m} = 4 \, \text{kg/h}
\]
