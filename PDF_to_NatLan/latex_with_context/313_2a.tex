A qualitative \( T \)-\( S \) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process paths:  
- An **adiabatic, irreversible nozzle reaction** is shown.  
- An **adiabatic, reversible compression** process is labeled.  
- An **isobaric heat addition** process is indicated.  
- The diagram also includes points labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), and \( 6 \), corresponding to different states in the engine cycle.  
- The curve for **adiabatic expansion with \( \eta < 1 \)** is drawn.  
- The axes are labeled \( T \) (temperature) and \( S \) (entropy).
