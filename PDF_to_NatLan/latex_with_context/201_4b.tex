The mass flow rate of the refrigerant (\( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \)) is calculated using the energy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_3 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_{\text{ab}}
\]  
Rearranging the equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K \implies \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

Additional assumptions:  
- \( h_2 = h_g \), \( s_2 = s_3 \).  
- \( h_3 \) is determined at \( 8 \, \text{bar} \) and \( T_3 \).  

A crossed-out term (\( \dot{Q}_K \)) is visible but ignored in the calculations.
