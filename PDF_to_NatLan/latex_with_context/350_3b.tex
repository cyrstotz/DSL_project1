The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined as follows:  

The temperature of the gas decreases due to heat transfer to the ice-water mixture. The temperature approaches \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) because the water has a high heat capacity.  

The pressure remains constant (\( p_2 = p_1 \)) because the external conditions do not change.  

At \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), the ice undergoes a phase transition, which consumes energy. The transition from solid to liquid requires less energy from the air, and the temperature stabilizes at \( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

Thus:  
\[
T_{g,2} \to 0^\circ\text{C}, \quad p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]
