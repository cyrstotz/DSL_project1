The mass-specific exergy destruction (\( \Delta ex_{\text{dest}} \)) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
\Delta ex_{5 \to 6} = ex_{5 \to 6} - ex_{5 \to 0} + \frac{1}{2} m w_6^2 - \frac{1}{2} m w_5^2
\]  

The enthalpy at state \( h_0 \) is given as:  
\[
h_0 (0.1916 \, \text{bar}, -30^\circ\text{C}) = 243.15 - 240.02
\]  

From the calculations:  
\[
h_0 = C + 850 - 286 \quad (D - C) = 243.179.45 + 293.779.16 \, \text{J/kg}
\]  

The entropy values are calculated as follows:  
\[
s_0 = A + 240, \quad C = 7.78229, \quad B = 250, \quad D = 250.05 \times 10^3
\]  
\[
s_0 = 14991.73 = 7.89943.70
\]  

For state \( s_6 \):  
\[
s_6 = A + 326, \quad C = 7.78229, \quad B = 330, \quad D = 7.73723 \quad (D - C)
\]  
\[
s_6 = 17991.99 = 7.79991.70
\]  

The mass-specific exergy destruction is then calculated as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{dest}} = 173.079.77 \, \text{J/kg}
\]
