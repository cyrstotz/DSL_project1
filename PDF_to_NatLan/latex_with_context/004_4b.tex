The energy balance for the compressor is considered under isentropic conditions:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_1 - h_3) - \dot{W} = 0
\]  
It is stated that \( p_2 = p_1 \), \( h_4 = h_1 \), and \( S_2 = S_3 \).  

To interpolate \( h_3 \), use \( S_3 \) in the provided tables. The interpolation process is described as follows:  
\[
S_2 = \frac{(2.2688 - 2.25)}{(2.2688 - 2.25)} \cdot (0.9566 - 0.9636) + 0.9636
\]  
This results in \( S_2 = 0.9632 = S_3 \).
