The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) in state 2 are determined as follows:  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) because the ice-water mixture (EW) remains in the two-phase region. Since the system is in thermal equilibrium, the temperature of the gas also equals \( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \). This is because the EW retains the same mass, and the piston weight remains constant. Therefore, the pressure does not change.
