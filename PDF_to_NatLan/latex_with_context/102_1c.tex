The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is calculated using the heat transfer \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) and the thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) of the coolant.  

\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}} = -\frac{-62.28 \, \text{kW}}{295 \, \text{K}} = 0.2112 \, \text{kJ/sÂ·K}
\]

A diagram is included, showing the reactor system with heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) transferring to the cooling jacket. The system boundary is labeled, and arrows indicate the direction of heat transfer.
