The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) for the system is calculated under the assumption of an open, stationary system with ideal liquid properties.  

Given:  
\[
T_{\text{KF,in}} = 288.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_{\text{KF,out}} = 298.15 \, \text{K}, \quad p_1 = p_2
\]  

The mean temperature is determined using the integral:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_{T_1}^{T_2} T \, dT}{\int_{T_1}^{T_2} dT}
\]  

Simplifying:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{2}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{288.15 + 298.15}{2} \approx 293.12 \, \text{K}
\]
