The coefficient of performance (\(\epsilon_K\)) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1)}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
where:  
- \(\dot{Q}_K\) is the heat removed by the refrigerant.  
- \(\dot{m}\) is the mass flow rate of the refrigerant.  
- \(h_2\) and \(h_1\) are the specific enthalpies at states 2 and 1, respectively.
