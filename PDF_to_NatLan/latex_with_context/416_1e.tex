The entropy values are calculated as follows:  
\[
S_1 = m_{\text{total},1} (1.306 + 0.005 (7.3545 - 1.306)) \quad \text{(from Table A-2, \( S_{\text{fld}} \) at \( 100^\circ\text{C} \))}
\]  
\[
S_2 = m_{\text{total},2} (0.554 + 0.005 (7.553 - 0.554)) \quad \text{(from Table A-2, \( S_{\text{fld}} \) at \( 70^\circ\text{C} \))}
\]  

The entropy change is given by:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = S_2 - S_1
\]  

Substituting the values:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = 269.53 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]
