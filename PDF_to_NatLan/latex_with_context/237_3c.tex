The entropy change \( \Delta S_g \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S_g = \frac{Q_{12}}{T_{g,2}}
\]  
The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) is calculated using:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1})
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 110.95 \, \text{J}
\]  

The temperatures are:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0.003^\circ \text{C} = 273.153 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
T_{g,1} = 773.15 \, \text{K}
\]
