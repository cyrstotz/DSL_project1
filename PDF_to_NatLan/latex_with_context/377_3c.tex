The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) is calculated with the following parameters:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0.003^\circ\text{C}, \, p_{g,2} = 1.5 \, \text{bar}, \, m_g = 3.6 \, \text{g}
\]  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\text{LHS: } \frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} (h + k + p) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  

For the heat transfer process:  
\[
\Delta u_{12} = \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  

Using the substance model:  
\[
m_g (u_2 - u_1) = Q
\]  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_v (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

The heat transferred is calculated as:  
\[
Q = m_g c_v (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) = 3.6 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \cdot (273.153 - 773.15) \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
Q = -1,133.39 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The magnitude of the heat transferred is:  
\[
|Q_{12}| = 1,133.39 \, \text{J}
\]  

Description of the diagram:  
A simple sketch shows a cylinder divided into two chambers. The lower chamber contains the gas, and the upper chamber contains the ice-water mixture. Heat \( Q_{12} \) flows from the gas to the ice-water mixture.

The final ice fraction is denoted as \( x_{\text{ice},2} \).  

The volume of the ice-water mixture (\( V_{\text{EW}} \)) is equal to the volume of the ice-water equilibrium (\( V_{\text{EW}} = V_{\text{EW}} \)).
