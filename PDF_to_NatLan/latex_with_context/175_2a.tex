The process is described qualitatively in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process steps:  
- From state 0 to 1: Isentropic compression.  
- From state 1 to 2: Isentropic compression.  
- From state 2 to 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
- From state 3 to 4: Isentropic expansion.  
- From state 4 to 5: Isobaric heat rejection.  
- From state 5 to 6: Isentropic expansion.  

The graph shows a curve with labeled states (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The isobaric processes are horizontal lines, and the isentropic processes are vertical or curved lines. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (specific entropy, \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)) on the horizontal axis.
