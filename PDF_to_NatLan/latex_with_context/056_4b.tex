The equation for the required refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_R \) is derived as follows:  
\[
Q_K = \dot{m}_{\text{pass}} (h_2 - h_1) + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
Rearranging for \( \dot{m}_R \):  
\[
\dot{m}_R = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h_2 - h_1}
\]  

Additionally, there is a partial equation for \( h_2 \):  
\[
h_2 = h_g
\]  

A small table is drawn with the following columns and rows:  
- Columns: \( z \), \( p \), \( T \)  
- Rows: 1, 2, 3, 4  
Values are partially filled in:  
- Row 3: \( p = 8 \)  
- Row 4: \( p = 8 \)
