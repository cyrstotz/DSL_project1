The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
O = \dot{Q}_{12} = C_g - h_{\text{EW}}
\]

The gas pressure \( p_{g,2} \) remains constant at \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \), as the weight of the piston (\( CF_g \)) remains constant and exerts the same pressure.

The equilibrium temperature \( T_2 \) of the ice-water mixture is:  
\[
T_2 = T_{\text{EW},1} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  
This is because the heat capacity and mass of water are significantly larger than the latent heat of fusion, and the mixture still contains ice. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature remains constant:  
\[
T_2 = T_{\text{EW},1} = T_{\text{15W}}
\]
