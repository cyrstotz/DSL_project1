A T-s diagram is drawn, illustrating the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. The diagram includes labeled points corresponding to different states in the process:  
- Point 0: Ambient conditions.  
- Point 1: Air compression.  
- Point 2: Isentropic compression.  
- Point 3: Combustion.  
- Point 4: Expansion in the turbine.  
- Point 5: Mixing chamber.  
- Point 6: Nozzle exit.  

The x-axis represents entropy \( S \) in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \), and the y-axis represents temperature \( T \). The process lines are drawn to show isentropic compression, isobaric combustion, and adiabatic expansion.  

Below the diagram, the text explains:  
At point 1, the air is compressed through the turbine process, while it is then directed to the mixing chamber.
