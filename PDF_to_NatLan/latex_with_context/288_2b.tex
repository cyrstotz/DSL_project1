An energy balance equation is written for the jet engine.  

\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{GES}} \left( h_0 - h_6 + \frac{w_0^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right) + \dot{Q}_{16}^0 - \dot{W}_{16}^0
\]

Another energy balance equation is written for state 5 to state 6:  

\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{GES}} \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right) + \dot{Q}_{56}^0 - \dot{W}_{56}^0
\]

A sketch of a turbine is drawn, showing the transition from state 5 to state 6.
