The goal is to calculate the transferred heat \( Q_{12} \) from gas to EW between states 1 and 2.  

The energy balance is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
\[
\Delta E_{12} = m (u_2 - u_1)
\]  

The internal energy difference is calculated using:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
\[
c_V = 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = 0.633 (0.003 - 500) = -316.488 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The work done is calculated as:  
\[
W_{12} = \int p_{1} \, dV = p_{1} (V_2 - V_1)
\]  

The system efficiency around the gas is considered.  

The reversible work is calculated as:  
\[
\omega_{12}^{\text{rev}} = \frac{R (T_2 - T_1)}{1 - n}
\]  
\[
n = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = \frac{R + c_v}{c_v} = 1.263
\]  
\[
\omega_{12}^{\text{rev}} = -112.822 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The total work is:  
\[
W_{12}^{\text{rev}} = m \omega_{12}^{\text{rev}} = -0.386 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
