The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is defined as:  
\[
\bar{T}_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int T \, ds}{s_2 - s_1}
\]  

The entropy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} \cdot (s_2 - s_1) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T} + s_{\text{gen}}
\]  

The heat flow per unit mass is expressed as:  
\[
q_{\text{out}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{\dot{m}}
\]  

The mean temperature is derived as:  
\[
\bar{T} = \frac{q_{\text{out}}}{s_2 - s_1}
\]  

Note: Some equations and derivations are crossed out and not considered in the transcription.

The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T \) is defined as:  
\[
T = \frac{\int_a^e T \, dS}{S_a - S_e}
\]

The entropy balance equation for the heat exchanger is written as:  
\[
\frac{d\dot{S}^2}{dt} = \dot{m}(S_e - S_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]
