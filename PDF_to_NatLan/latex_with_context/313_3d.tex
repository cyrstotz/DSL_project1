The change in energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \sum m_i h_i + \sum Q - \sum W
\]  
Rewriting the equation:  
\[
m_2 u_2 - m_{\text{gas}} u_1 = \sum \Delta m_i h_i - Q
\]  

Values provided:  
\[
h_1 = 252.88
\]  
\[
u_2 = 252.85
\]  
\[
u_1 = 418.94 + 0.005 \left( 2506.5 - 918.59 \right) = 925.377
\]

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{Q} - \dot{W}_{\text{out}} = 0
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
dU = Q_{12}
\]  
The change in internal energy is calculated using:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_1 = -333.458 + 0.6 \cdot (-0.005 \cdot -333.458) = -133.426
\]  
The final internal energy is given by:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q_{12}}{m}
\]  

The note "kann sich nicht verschieben" translates to "cannot shift/move."
