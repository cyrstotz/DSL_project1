The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is calculated as:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{h_{\text{KF,out}} - h_{\text{KF,in}}}{s_{\text{KF,out}} - s_{\text{KF,in}}}
\]  
where \( h_{\text{KF,out}} \) and \( h_{\text{KF,in}} \) are the specific enthalpies of the coolant at the outlet and inlet, and \( s_{\text{KF,out}} \) and \( s_{\text{KF,in}} \) are the specific entropies of the coolant at the outlet and inlet.
