The first law of thermodynamics is applied to states 2 and 3:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K  
\]
The enthalpy at state 2 is given as:  
\[
h_2 = h_g(10^\circ\text{C}) = 249.53 \, \text{kJ/kg}  
\]  
The enthalpy at state 3 (\(h_3\)) is not fully calculated on the page.  

No further calculations or results are visible for this subtask.

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
where:  
\[
h_g = h_g(T_1), \quad h_f = h_f(T_1), \quad h_1 = \text{(to be determined)}
\]
