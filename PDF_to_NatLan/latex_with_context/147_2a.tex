The process is represented on a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram with labeled isobars and states. The diagram includes the following features:  
- States 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked.  
- The process transitions between states with arrows indicating the direction of flow.  
- Isobaric lines are labeled for \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( p_6 = p_0 - 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (specific entropy in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \)) on the horizontal axis.
