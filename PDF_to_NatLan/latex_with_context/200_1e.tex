The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is calculated using the following equations:

\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1
\]

The mass \( m_2 \) is determined as:

\[
m_2 = \Delta m + m_1 = 9349.37 \, \text{kg}
\]

The specific entropy \( s_2 \) at \( 70^\circ\text{C} \) is given as:

\[
s_2 = s_f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 0.9549 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]

The specific entropy \( s_1 \) at \( 100^\circ\text{C} \) is calculated using the steam quality \( x_D \):

\[
s_1 = x_D \cdot s_g + (1 - x_D) \cdot s_f = 1.3377 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]

Finally, the entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is computed as:

\[
\Delta S_{12} = 7227.93 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]
