The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} (u_2 - u_1) + m_g (u_2 - u_1) = \dot{Q} = 0
\]  
This equation simplifies to zero, indicating no net heat exchange.

The pressure of the gas is equal to the pressure of the ice-water mixture:  
\[
p_g = p_{\text{EW}}
\]

The internal energy of the ice-water mixture is calculated as:  
\[
u_{\text{EW}} = u_{\text{ice}} = -333.638 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + \left( -0.05 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + 333.638 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \right) = -333.641 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The change in internal energy for the gas is given by:  
\[
m_g (u_2 - u_1) = m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1) = -1.082 \, \text{kJ}
\]

The internal energy of the ice-water mixture at state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
u_{2,\text{EW}} = u_1 + \frac{m_g (u_2 - u_1)}{m_{\text{EW}}} = -122.55 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The pressure of the ice-water mixture at state 2 is equal to the ambient pressure:  
\[
p_{2,\text{EW}} = p_{\text{amb}} = 1.48 \, \text{bar}
\]

The temperature of the ice-water mixture at state 1 is equal to the temperature at state 2:  
\[
T_{1,\text{EW}} = T_{2,\text{EW}}
\]

The final ice fraction \( x \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
x = \frac{u_{2,\text{EW}} + 333.638 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}}{-0.05 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + 333.638 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}} = 0.632
\]
