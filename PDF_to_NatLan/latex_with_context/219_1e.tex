The entropy change of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated using:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1 = \Delta m_{12} s_{\text{in}} + S_{Q,12}
\]  

Where:  
- \( s_1 \) and \( s_2 \) are the specific entropies at states 1 and 2, respectively.  
- \( s_{\text{in}} \) is the specific entropy of the added water.  
- \( S_{Q,12} \) is the entropy change due to heat transfer.
