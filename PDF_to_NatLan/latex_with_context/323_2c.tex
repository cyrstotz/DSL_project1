The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated as:  
\[
w_6 = -85.4355 \, \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2} + (200 \, \text{m/s})^2
\]  
This results in:  
\[
w_6 = -130871 \, \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}
\]  
However, the direction must match \( w_e \), leading to:  
\[
w_6 = 130871 \, \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}
\]
