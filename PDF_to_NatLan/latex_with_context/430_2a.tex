A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process states (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).  
- State 0 is the ambient condition.  
- States 1 to 2 represent the compression process.  
- States 3 to 4 correspond to isobaric combustion.  
- States 4 to 5 represent the turbine process.  
- State 6 is the nozzle exit.  
The diagram shows arrows indicating the direction of the process flow, and the isentropic lines are clearly marked.
