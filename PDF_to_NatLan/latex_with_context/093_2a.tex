The diagram is a temperature-entropy (T-s) plot illustrating the jet engine thermodynamic process. It includes labeled isobars at 30 bar, 50 bar, and ambient pressure (p0). The process follows the sequence of states:  
- State 0: Initial ambient conditions.  
- State 1: Compression (reversible adiabatic).  
- State 2: Combustion (isobaric heat addition).  
- State 3: Expansion through the turbine (irreversible adiabatic).  
- State 5: Mixing chamber conditions.  
- State 6: Nozzle exit conditions.  

The graph shows curved lines for compression and expansion, and straight horizontal lines for isobaric processes.
