The diagram provided is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. It includes labeled isobars and key states:  
- State 0: \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} \).  
- State 1: \( p_1 = p_2 \).  
- State 2: \( p_2 = p_3 \).  
- State 3: \( p_3 = p_4 \).  
- State 4: \( p_4 = p_5 \).  
- State 5: \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  
- State 6: \( p_6 = p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K} \).  

The diagram shows the progression of the process from state 0 to state 6, with arrows indicating the direction of entropy change. The isobars are curved lines, and the temperature increases along the process path.
