Determine \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \) in state 2.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to the equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture, which is \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \) or \( 273.15 \, \text{K} \).  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) remains equal to \( p_{\text{amb}} \), as the piston is in equilibrium with the atmospheric pressure.
