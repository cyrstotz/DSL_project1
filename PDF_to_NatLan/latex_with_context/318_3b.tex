The specific heat capacity \( c_p \) is calculated as:  
\[
c_p = R + c_v = 799.28 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

The ratio of specific heat capacities \( \frac{c_p}{c_v} \) is given as:  
\[
\frac{c_p}{c_v} = n = 1.26
\]  

The pressure remains constant from state 1 to state 2:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) of the gas will be slightly above \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), as ice is still present, and the ice-water mixture has a temperature of approximately \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

A small sketch is drawn showing the relationship between \( T_{g,1} \), \( T_{g,2} \), and \( p_{g,1} \). It indicates that \( T_{g,2} \) is close to \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).
