A phase diagram is drawn with temperature \( T \, [^\circ\text{C}] \) on the x-axis and pressure \( p \, [\text{bar}] \) on the y-axis. The diagram includes the solid, liquid, and gas regions, separated by phase boundaries.  
- The solid-liquid boundary is labeled "isobaric."  
- The liquid-gas boundary is labeled "isothermal."  
- Two steps are marked:  
  - Step \( i \) starts in the liquid region and moves to the gas region.  
  - Step \( ii \) starts in the solid region and moves along the solid-liquid boundary.
