The graph depicts the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram. The vertical axis represents pressure in millibars (\(p\)), and the horizontal axis represents temperature in degrees Celsius (\(T\)).  
- The curve labeled "Triple point" indicates the phase equilibrium between solid, liquid, and vapor.  
- Point 2 is connected to point 1 via an "isobar single curve," indicating constant pressure.  
- Point 3 is connected to point 1 via an "isotherm," indicating constant temperature.
