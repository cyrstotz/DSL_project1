The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is calculated using the integral definition:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_{s_a}^{s_e} T \, ds}{s_a - s_e}
\]  

The entropy difference \( s_a - s_e \) is expressed as:  
\[
s_a - s_e = \int_{T_2}^{T_1} \frac{c_{p}(T)}{T} \, dT
\]  
where \( p \) is constant and \( n = \text{constant} \).  

From the calculation, the thermodynamic mean temperature is determined to be:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = 295 \, \text{K}
\]
