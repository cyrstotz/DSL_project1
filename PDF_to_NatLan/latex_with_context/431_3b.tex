The pressure \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \), as the piston does not exert additional force, and the force equilibrium remains unchanged.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} \), as the gas and EW are in thermal equilibrium. Since ice is still present in the EW, the temperature cannot increase above the melting point. The gas and EW must have the same temperature due to thermodynamic equilibrium.
