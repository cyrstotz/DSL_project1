The following equations are written:  
\[
\dot{m}(h_2 - h_3) = \dot{W}_\text{K}
\]  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_\text{K}}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
\[
p_3 = p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Explanation:  
- The first equation represents the energy balance for the compressor, where \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate, \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are specific enthalpies, and \( \dot{W}_\text{K} \) is the work input to the compressor.  
- The second equation rearranges the energy balance to solve for the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \).  
- The third equation states that the pressure at points 3 and 4 is constant at 8 bar.
