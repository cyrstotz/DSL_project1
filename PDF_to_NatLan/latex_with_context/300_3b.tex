If thermodynamic equilibrium exists and there is still ice in the EW mixture, the temperature must remain at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \).  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C}
\]  

The gas pressure in state 2 remains the same as in state 1:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 9.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  
This is because the same weight is exerted from above.
