A table is drawn with columns labeled \( P \), \( T \), and \( x \). Rows are numbered from 1 to 4, but the entries are incomplete:  
- Row 1: No values are provided.  
- Row 2: Pressure (\( P \)) is marked, but temperature (\( T \)) and vapor quality (\( x \)) are blank.  
- Row 3: Pressure (\( P \)) is marked, but temperature (\( T \)) and vapor quality (\( x \)) are blank.  
- Row 4: Vapor quality (\( x \)) is marked as \( 0 \), but pressure (\( P \)) and temperature (\( T \)) are blank.  

No further explanation or calculations are provided for the table.
