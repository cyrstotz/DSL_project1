The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using:  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
where \( T_2 \) is the final temperature, \( T_1 \) is the initial temperature, \( m \) is the mass of the gas, and \( c_V \) is the specific heat capacity.  

The internal energy at state 2, \( u_2 \), is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q_{12}}{m} + u_1
\]  
Substituting the values, \( u_2 = 239.634 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).
