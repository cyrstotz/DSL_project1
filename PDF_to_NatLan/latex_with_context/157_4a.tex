Two diagrams are drawn to represent the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\(P\)-\(T\)) diagram.  

- The first diagram shows three distinct regions labeled "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). The phase boundaries are drawn, and three states are marked:  
  1. State 1 is located in the solid region.  
  2. State 2 is on the boundary between solid and liquid.  
  3. State 3 is on the boundary between liquid and gas.  

- The second diagram simplifies the phase regions and shows the transitions between states 1, 2, and 3 along the phase boundaries.
