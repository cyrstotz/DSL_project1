The entropy production is calculated using the entropy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (s_e - s_a) + \frac{-\dot{Q}}{\bar{T}} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
Rearranging for entropy generation:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (s_{\text{out}} - s_{\text{in}}) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{\bar{T}}
\]  

The entropy values are determined from the water tables:  
\[
s_{\text{in}} = s_f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 7.2533 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
\[
s_{\text{out}} = s_f(100^\circ\text{C}) = 7.3543 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \quad \text{(from Table A-3)}
\]  

Substituting these values:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 0.41 \, \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}}
\]  

It is noted that this entropy production occurs between the water and the coolant, contributing to the total entropy.
