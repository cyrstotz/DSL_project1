The page contains mathematical derivations and diagrams related to jet engine exergy analysis. Below is the transcription of visible content:

### Mathematical Derivations:
1. The equation appears to involve terms for velocity and energy balance:
   \[
   \frac{z_2}{2m} - \frac{z_2}{2m} + \left( \frac{w_5^2}{2} \right) m - \left( \frac{w_1}{2} \right) m - (q_1 - q_1) d = \ldots
   \]
   Followed by:
   \[
   (q_1 + (0.5 - 0.5) q_1 - q_4 - q_4) = 45 \, ex.
   \]

2. Another equation involving velocity and energy terms:
   \[
   \sqrt{5m \cdot 800z} = \ldots
   \]

3. A rearranged form of the energy equation:
   \[
   (q_1 - q_1) d - z_2 = 10
   \]
   And:
   \[
   (q_1 - q_1) d - z_2 = \frac{z_2}{2m} - \frac{z_2}{2m}
   \]

4. Final derivation:
   \[
   \frac{z_2}{2m} - \frac{z_2}{2m} + (q_4 - q_4) m - \frac{w_1}{2} m = 0
   \]

### Diagrams:
Two diagrams are present at the bottom of the page. They appear to be qualitative representations of thermodynamic processes in a jet engine:

1. **Left Diagram**:  
   - A graph with axes labeled \( s \) (entropy) and \( T \) (temperature).  
   - The diagram includes curves representing isobars and a process path labeled \( 1 \) and \( 5 \).  
   - A dashed line connects points, indicating a transition or mixing process.  

2. **Right Diagram**:  
   - Similar axes labeled \( s \) and \( T \).  
   - Curves represent thermodynamic states, with points labeled \( 1 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \).  
   - A bold curve indicates a process path, and arrows show the direction of transitions.  

Both diagrams qualitatively depict the jet engine cycle, with entropy and temperature changes during compression, combustion, and expansion phases.

**Diagram Description:**
The diagram is a qualitative representation of a thermodynamic process on a \( T \)-\( s \) (temperature-entropy) diagram. It includes:
- Several curves and arrows indicating the progression of the process.
- Labeled points corresponding to different states (e.g., \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 5 \)).
- Isobars and entropy changes are marked, with arrows showing transitions between states.
- A vertical green line indicates a specific entropy difference.

**Mathematical Derivations:**

1. **Entropy Relation:**
   \[
   s_5 = s_6
   \]

2. **Energy Balance for Reversible Adiabatic Process:**
   \[
   h_5 - h_6 = \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_5^2}{2}
   \]

3. **Velocity Relation:**
   \[
   w_6 = \sqrt{w_5^2 + 2(h_5 - h_6)}
   \]

4. **Flow Exergy Change:**
   \[
   \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = \left( \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} \right) + (h_6 - h_0) - T_0(s_6 - s_0)
   \]

5. **Exergy Destruction:**
   \[
   ex_{\text{dest}} = ex_{\text{in}} - ex_{\text{out}}
   \]

6. **Specific Work and Exergy Relation:**
   \[
   W_{\text{specific}} = (+) W_m - ex_{\text{out}} + ex_{\text{in}}
   \]

7. **Additional Relations:**
   \[
   h_6 = h_5 - \frac{w_6^2}{2}
   \]
   \[
   s_6 = s_5
   \]

8. **Mass Flow Rate Calculation:**
   \[
   \dot{m} = \frac{w}{T} \cdot \Delta s
   \]

**Notes:**
- The derivations include entropy, enthalpy, and velocity relationships, as well as exergy calculations.
- The equations are consistent with the jet engine exergy problem described in Task 2.
- Some parts of the derivations are partially obscured or unclear but appear to follow standard thermodynamic principles.
