The pressure exerted by the piston and the ice-water mixture is calculated as:  
\[
p = \frac{m_K \cdot g}{A_{\text{EW}}} = \frac{32 \cdot 9.81}{\pi \cdot (5 \, \text{cm})^2}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
p = 7.0 \, \text{kPa} + p_{\text{atm}} = 1.48 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = \sum Q - \sum W
\]  

The specific internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated using:  
\[
u_2 = u_c + x \cdot (u_g - u_f)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = -200.39 + x \cdot (-407.98 - (-200.39))
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  

Solving for \( u_2 \):  
\[
u_2 = -200.39 + \frac{-200.398 + 333.458}{0.045 + 3.33458} = 0.40
\]  

The final ice fraction is approximately:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 40\%
\]
