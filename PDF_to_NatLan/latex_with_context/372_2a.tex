A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is \( T \) (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is \( s \) (specific entropy) with units \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  

The diagram includes labeled points and processes:  
- Point \( O \) represents the ambient state.  
- Point \( 1 \) is connected to \( 2 \) via an adiabatic compression process.  
- Point \( 2 \) to \( 3 \) represents an isobaric heat addition process.  
- Point \( 3 \) to \( 4 \) is an adiabatic expansion process.  
- Point \( 4 \) to \( 5 \) represents a mixing process.  
- Point \( 5 \) to \( 6 \) is an isobaric process.  
- The pressures \( p_3 = p_2 \), \( p_4 = p_5 \), and \( p_6 = p_0 \) are indicated.
