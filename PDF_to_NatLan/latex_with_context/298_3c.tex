The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
\Delta E_{1 \to 2} = \dot{Q} + \dot{W}
\]

Since work is negligible, the heat transfer is expressed as:  
\[
Q = \Delta E = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_{2,g} - T_{1,g})
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
Q = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_{2,g} - T_{1,g})
\]

\[
Q = 0.03643 \cdot 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \cdot (0 - 500^\circ\text{C})
\]

\[
Q = -11.53927 \, \text{kJ} = -11.539 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

This represents the heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture.
