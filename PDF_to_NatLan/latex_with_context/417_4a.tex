A graph is drawn on a \( T \)-\( p \) diagram. The graph shows a cycle with four labeled points: 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- Point 1 is at the lower left, representing the starting state.  
- Point 2 is higher on the \( T \)-axis, indicating an increase in temperature.  
- Point 3 is at the peak of the cycle, showing the highest temperature and pressure.  
- Point 4 is on the downward slope, returning to lower pressure and temperature.  
The cycle appears to represent a thermodynamic process, possibly related to a refrigeration or freeze-drying cycle.
