The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1 = (m_1 + \Delta m_{12}) s_2 - m_1 s_1 = 1237.894 \, \text{J/K}
\]  

From Table A-2:  
- \( s_1 = S(100^\circ\text{C}, x = 0.005) = s_f + x(s_g - s_f) = 7.33774 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)  
- \( s_2 = s_f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 0.9545 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)
