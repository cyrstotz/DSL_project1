Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. **Diagram 1**:  
   - A rectangular cycle is plotted on a \( T \)-\( p \) diagram.  
   - The cycle consists of four numbered points (1, 2, 3, 4) connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
   - The process moves sequentially:  
     - From point 1 to point 2 (upward in \( T \)),  
     - From point 2 to point 3 (rightward in \( p \)),  
     - From point 3 to point 4 (downward in \( T \)),  
     - From point 4 back to point 1 (leftward in \( p \)).  

2. **Diagram 2**:  
   - A triangular cycle is plotted on a \( T \)-\( p \) diagram.  
   - The cycle includes labeled processes:  
     - "isotherm" (horizontal line),  
     - "isochore" (vertical line),  
     - "isobar" (diagonal line).  
   - The cycle also includes a region labeled "Nassdampf" (wet steam).
