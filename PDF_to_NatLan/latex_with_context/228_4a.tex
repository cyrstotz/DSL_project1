A graph is drawn with pressure \( P \, [\text{bar}] \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \, [\text{K}] \) on the horizontal axis. The graph represents a phase diagram, including the triple point labeled as "Tripelpunkt." Two processes are marked:  
1. A horizontal arrow pointing left, labeled "i," indicating a cooling process.  
2. A vertical arrow pointing upward, labeled "ii," indicating a pressure increase.

The equation for the system is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] + \dot{W}
\]
