The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\dot{m} \left[ h_5 - h_6 \right] + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} = 0
\]  

Additional notes:  
- \( w_5 = w_6 \).

The expression for the mass-specific increase in flow exergy is given as:  
\[
\dot{m} \, ex_{\text{flow}} = \dot{m} \left[ h - h_0 - T_0 \left( s - s_0 \right) + ke \right]
\]  

The equation for interpolation is:  
\[
y = y_1 + \frac{\left( y_2 - y_1 \right)}{\left( x_2 - x_1 \right)} \left( x - x_1 \right)
\]  

The mass flow ratio between bypass and core streams is calculated as:  
\[
\frac{m_M}{m_K} = 5.263
\]
