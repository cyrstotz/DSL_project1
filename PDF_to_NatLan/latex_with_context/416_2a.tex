The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(S\)) diagram.  
- The axes are labeled as \(T\) (temperature in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and \(S\) (entropy) on the horizontal axis.  
- The process includes labeled states: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.  
- The diagram shows isobaric and isentropic processes:  
  - Between states 0 and 1, the process is isentropic.  
  - Between states 1 and 2, the process is isobaric.  
  - Between states 2 and 3, the process is isobaric.  
  - Between states 5 and 6, the process is isentropic.  
- Pressure values are noted: \(p_2\), \(p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}\), and \(p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}\).  
- The diagram includes arrows indicating the direction of the processes.
