The vapor quality \( x_1 = 0 \).  
The pressure \( p_{\text{comp}} = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  

The process is described as adiabatic.  

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_{k,2} - h_{k,1}) = \dot{W}_K + Q
\]  
Given values:  
\[
h_{k,2} = h_{k,1} = 53.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
