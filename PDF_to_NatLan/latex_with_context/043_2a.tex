The page begins with a labeled \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The diagram includes the following features:  
- Axes: \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (specific entropy) on the horizontal axis, with units \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).  
- Points labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \) corresponding to different states in the jet engine process.  
- The process includes isobaric and adiabatic transformations:  
  - Between \( 1 \) and \( 2 \): Isobaric heating.  
  - Between \( 2 \) and \( 3 \): Adiabatic compression.  
  - Between \( 3 \) and \( 5 \): Isobaric combustion.  
  - Between \( 5 \) and \( 6 \): Adiabatic expansion.  
- The bypass stream is labeled \( \dot{m}_M \), and the ambient pressure is noted as \( p_0 = p_6 \).
