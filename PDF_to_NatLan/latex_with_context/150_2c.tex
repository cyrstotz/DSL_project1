The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \Delta ke + \Delta he
\]  
where \( T_0 = 243.75 \, \text{K} \), and the kinetic energy term is given by:  
\[
\Delta ke = -\frac{w_0^2}{2} + \frac{w_6^2}{2}
\]  

The enthalpy difference is calculated as:  
\[
h_6 - h_0 = c_p (T_6 - T_0) = 85.423 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The entropy difference is calculated as:  
\[
s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) = 0.307 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

Substituting these values, the flow exergy increase is:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = 12.757 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + \Delta he
\]  
\[
= 96.49 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
