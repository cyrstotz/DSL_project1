The temperature inside the system would decrease to \(-26^\circ\text{C}\). During this process, the water in the food would remain frozen.

The equation for the energy balance is given as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \cdot (h_4 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
The initial temperature of the system is specified as \( T_i = -20^\circ\text{C} \).  

The enthalpy at state \( 1 \) is partially written as:  
\[
h_1 = (\ldots)
\]  

No further details are provided for \( h_1 \).
