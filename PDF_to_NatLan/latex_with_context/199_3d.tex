The energy balance equation is again written as:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W
\]  
Expanding the terms for the system:  
\[
m_{\text{EW},2} \cdot u_{\text{EW},2} + m_{\text{water}} \cdot u_{\text{water,12}} - m_{\text{EW},1} \cdot u_{\text{EW},1} - m_{\text{gas}} \cdot u_{\text{gas,1}} = Q_{12}
\]  

Some terms are crossed out and ignored in the calculation. The equation remains structured for further substitution and evaluation.
