The energy balance equation for the reactor is written as:  
\[
\dot{m}(h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_R = 0
\]  
where \( h_e = 292.98 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \) and \( h_a = 419.09 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{Q}_R = 62.18 \, \text{kW}
\]
