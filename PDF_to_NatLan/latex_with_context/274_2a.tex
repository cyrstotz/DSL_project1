The task begins with a T-s diagram representing the thermodynamic processes of a jet engine. The diagram is labeled with entropy \( s \) (in \( \text{kJ/kg} \)) on the x-axis and temperature \( T \) (in \( \text{K} \)) on the y-axis. The diagram includes five states connected by various processes:  
- \( 1 \to 2 \): Adiabatic, reversible compression.  
- \( 2 \to 3 \): Isobaric heat addition.  
- \( 3 \to 4 \): Adiabatic, irreversible expansion.  
- \( 4 \to 5 \): Isobaric mixing chamber.  
- \( 5 \to 6 \): Reversible adiabatic nozzle.  

The processes are labeled as follows:  
- \( 1 \to 2 \): Adiabatic reversible compression.  
- \( 2 \to 3 \): Isobaric heat transfer.  
- \( 3 \to 4 \): Adiabatic irreversible expansion.  
- \( 4 \to 5 \): Isobaric mixing chamber.  
- \( 5 \to 6 \): Reversible adiabatic nozzle.
