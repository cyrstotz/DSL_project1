The pressure of the gas is given by:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{EW}}
\]  
The ideal gas law is applied:  
\[
p V = m R T
\]  
At equilibrium, the relationship between the internal energies is expressed as:  
\[
U_{\text{EW}} - U_{\text{g}} = C
\]  
The specific heat at constant volume is noted as:  
\[
c_V = 0.633 \, \frac{1}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  
The specific heat at constant pressure (\( c_p \)) is left undefined.
