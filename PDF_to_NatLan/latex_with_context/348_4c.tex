The enthalpy \( h_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
h_2 = h_{\text{sat}} + x \cdot h_{\text{fg,sat}}
\]  

Where \( h_{\text{sat}} \) is the saturated liquid enthalpy, \( h_{\text{fg,sat}} \) is the latent heat of vaporization, and \( x \) is the vapor quality.  

Entropy interpolation is performed for \( s_2 \) and \( s_f \), using the saturated values at \( p_3 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).

Description of crossed-out content:  
Several equations and calculations are crossed out, including entropy interpolation steps and values for \( s_2 \), \( s_f \), and \( h_g \). These are ignored as per instructions.
