The pressure remains constant, \( p_{1,3} = p_{2,3} \), because the temperature changes, but at the same time, the volume also changes as the mass pushes downward.

Using the first law of thermodynamics:  
\[
\Delta U = \dot{m} \cdot Q_{12}
\]

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 3.6 \, \text{kg} \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]
