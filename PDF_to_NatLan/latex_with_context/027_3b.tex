The pressure in state 2 is equal to \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.1002 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Explanation:  
The same weight is pushing down, and the system is closed, so no gas escapes.  

In state 2:  
- Thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved.  
- Equal temperature is reached:  
\[
T_{2,g} = T_{2,\text{EW}}
\]
