The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},12} \) is calculated.  

For the equilibrium water (EW):  
The temperature \( T_{\text{EN},12} \) is \( 0.003^\circ\text{C} \).  

The energy balance for EW is:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = -Q_{12}
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
U_2 = U_1 - Q_{12}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
U_2 = U_1 - \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}}
\]  

From the tables:  
\[
U_1 = U_f + x \cdot (U_g - U_f)
\]  
Given \( x = 0.6 \), \( T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} \):  
\[
U_1 = -133.41 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

For \( U_2 \):  
\[
U_2 = U_1 - \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}} = -122.5805 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The final ice fraction \( x_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{U_2 - U_f}{U_g - U_f} = 0.9888
\]
