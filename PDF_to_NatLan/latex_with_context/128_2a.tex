A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), representing temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}] \), representing specific entropy.  

The diagram includes the following features:  
- Points labeled \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \) connected by lines.  
- The process between points \( 0 \) and \( 1 \) is labeled "isobar".  
- The process between points \( 1 \) and \( 3 \) is labeled "isotherm".  
- The process between points \( 3 \) and \( 4 \) is labeled "isotherm".  
- The process between points \( 4 \) and \( 5 \) is labeled "isobar".
