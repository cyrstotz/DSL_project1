A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled points corresponding to states \( 1 \) through \( 6 \), with arrows showing the transitions between states. The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \), and the horizontal axis is labeled \( s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}] \). Several isobaric lines are drawn, and the points \( 5 \) and \( 6 \) are marked with asterisks to indicate isobaric processes. The pressures \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) are noted.
