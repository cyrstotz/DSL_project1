The membrane is a heat conductor, ensuring that the gas and EW (ice-water mixture) reach the same temperature. The same applies to the pressure, as the membrane is frictionless.  

The pressure in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
p_2 = \frac{F_K}{A} = \frac{32 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.80665 \, \text{m/s}^2}{0.005 \, \text{m}^2} = 3955.59847 \, \text{N/m}^2
\]  
Approximated as:  
\[
p_2 \approx 3955.6 \, \text{N/m}^2
\]
