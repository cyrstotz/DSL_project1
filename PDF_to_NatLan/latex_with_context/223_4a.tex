A graph is drawn with axes labeled \( p \) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \( T \) (temperature) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts a cycle with four numbered points (1, 2, 3, 4) connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process. The cycle appears to represent a thermodynamic process.
