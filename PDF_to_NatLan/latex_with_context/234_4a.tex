A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn to represent the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes the following elements:  
- The \( p \)-axis is labeled in mbar, with points marked at 0.5 mbar and 1 mbar.  
- The \( T \)-axis is labeled in \( ^\circ \text{C} \).  
- A curve labeled "gas" separates the liquid and gas regions.  
- The triple point is marked on the curve.  
- States 1, 2, and 3 are labeled, with arrows indicating transitions between them.  
- State 1 is above the curve, state 2 is on the curve, and state 3 is below the curve.
