The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta U = Q - W \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta Q = \Delta U + W = -1229.183 \, \text{J}
\]  

The change in internal energy (\( \Delta U \)) is calculated using:  
\[
\Delta U = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = -1139.333 \, \text{J}
\]  

The work (\( W \)) is calculated as:  
\[
W = R \cdot \frac{T_2 - T_1}{n} \cdot \dot{m} = -89.789 \, \text{J}
\]
