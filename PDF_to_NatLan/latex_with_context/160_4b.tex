The refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is being calculated. The inlet temperature \( T_i = 10^\circ\text{C} \) and outlet temperature \( T_n = 4^\circ\text{C} \) are specified.  

A schematic diagram of the refrigeration cycle is drawn, showing four states (1, 2, 3, and 4) with arrows indicating the flow of work \( \dot{W}_K \).  

The steady-state energy balance is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{W}_K
\]  
The process is described as adiabatic and reversible, with \( s_2 = s_3 \).  

From Table A-11, the enthalpy at state 4 is given as:  
\[
h_4 = h_{\text{eq}}(8 \, \text{bar}) = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} = h_1
\]  

The enthalpy at state 3 is determined using the throttling process:  
\[
h_3 = h_4 \quad \text{(no change in enthalpy during throttling)}
\]  

The mass flow rate is calculated using the equation:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]
