The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S = S_2 - S_1 = m_2 S_2 - m_1 S_1 = \Delta m \cdot S(20^\circ\text{C}) + \frac{Q}{T} + S_{\text{gen}}
\]  

This equation accounts for the added mass, heat transfer, and entropy generation during the cooling process.
