The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is calculated as zero because the system is stationary. An entropy balance is applied to the reactor:  

\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (s_e - s_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}_R + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]

Here, \( s_e \) and \( s_a \) are the specific entropies at the inlet and outlet, respectively. The entropy values are determined from the water tables:  

\[
s_e = s_f + x_D (s_g - s_f) \quad \text{at } T_{\text{Reactor},1}
\]

\[
s_a = s_f + x_0 (s_g - s_f) \quad \text{at } T_{\text{Reactor},1}
\]

The specific entropy values are given as:  
\[
s_e = 0.98892 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]
\[
s_a = 1.33 + 1.4 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]

The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = -0.0241 \quad \text{(this value seems to be noted as incorrect or not possible).}
\]
