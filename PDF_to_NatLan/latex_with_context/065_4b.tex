The inlet temperature \(T_i\) is calculated as:  
\[
T_i = T_0 - 6 \, \text{K}
\]  
Given \(T_0 = -10^\circ\text{C}\), this converts to:  
\[
T_i = 263.15 \, \text{K}
\]  

From the refrigerant table (TAB A-10), the enthalpy at \(T = -10^\circ\text{C}\) is:  
\[
h_f(T = -10^\circ\text{C}) = h_f(T = -10^\circ\text{C}) = 29.30 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The pressure at states 3 and 4 is given as:  
\[
p_3 = p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The vapor quality at state 4 is \(x_4 = 0\), indicating saturated liquid. From the refrigerant table (TAB A-11), the enthalpy at \(p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar}\) is:  
\[
h_4 = h_g(T_4 = 8 \, \text{bar}) + 263.15 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
