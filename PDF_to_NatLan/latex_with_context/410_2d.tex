The exergy destruction term is expressed as:  
\[
E_{\text{ideal}} = T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  

The entropy generation term is given by:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \dot{m} \left( s_{\text{out}} - s_{\text{in}} \right)
\]  

The exergy destruction is calculated as:  
\[
E_{\text{exergy}} = T_0 \left( s_{\text{out}} - s_{\text{in}} \right)
\]
