The pressure will remain constant because the atmospheric pressure and the weight of the piston do not change. Therefore:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{g,2}
\]  
The temperature will decrease to \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) as the ice-water mixture (EW) reaches equilibrium. This means that water and ice coexist at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), which is the equilibrium temperature for this system.
