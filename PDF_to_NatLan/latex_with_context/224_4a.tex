The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) plot illustrating the freeze-drying process.  
- The phase regions are labeled as "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous).  
- The triple point is marked, and the chamber pressure is reduced to 5 mbar below the triple point.  
- The process steps are labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4, with arrows indicating transitions between states.  
- \(T_i\) is shown as a horizontal line above the sublimation temperature.
