The problem begins with the energy balance equation:  
\[
\Delta E = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1
\]  
It is stated that \(\Delta E = U\), implying the change in internal energy.  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} (u_2 - u_1)
\]  

Values for temperatures and internal energies are provided:  
- \(T_1 = 343.15 \, \text{K}\)  
- \(T_2 = 373.15 \, \text{K}\)  

The pressure values are crossed out and not used.  

The internal energy values are:  
- \(u_1 = 288.15 \, \text{K}\)  
- \(u_2 = 258.15 \, \text{K}\)  

The mass flow rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m} = 62.55 \, \text{kg/s}
\]  

The heat flow is determined as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 6.288 \, \text{kJ/s}
\]
