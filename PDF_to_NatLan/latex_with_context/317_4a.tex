A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn.  
- The diagram shows phase regions labeled as "gas," "liquid," and "solid."  
- The triple point is marked where the three phases coexist.  
- Isobars are drawn, with one labeled as "isobar" and another labeled as "isotherm."  
- States 1, 3, and 4 are marked on the diagram, connected by lines indicating transitions.  
- The diagram includes arrows pointing to the "solid" and "liquid" regions, with annotations "fest" (solid) and "fl√ºssig" (liquid).
