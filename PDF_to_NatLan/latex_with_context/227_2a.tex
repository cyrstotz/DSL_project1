A graph is drawn representing a T-s diagram for a jet engine process. The diagram includes the following features:  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T(K) \) (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( S \) (entropy).  
- The process begins at point \( 1 \), moves isothermally to point \( 2 \), then transitions to point \( 3 \) along an isobaric line.  
- From point \( 3 \), the process continues to point \( 4 \), and then to point \( 5 \), ending at point \( 6 \).  
- The isothermal and isobaric processes are clearly marked.  
- The diagram includes a feedback loop labeled \( W_D \) and \( k_{p} \cdot k \).
