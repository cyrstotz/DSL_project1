The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph illustrating a thermodynamic cycle. The cycle consists of four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The processes between these states are as follows:  
- From state 1 to state 2: Isentropic process.  
- From state 2 to state 3: Isobaric process.  
- From state 3 to state 4: Isentropic process.  
- From state 4 back to state 1: Isobaric process.  

The graph also includes annotations for "Isotherm" and "ND" (possibly indicating a specific region or point of interest).
