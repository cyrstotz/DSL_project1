The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated as follows:

The entropy at state 1 is given by:  
\[
S_1 = m_1 S_f(100^\circ\text{C}) + m_2 S_f(20^\circ\text{C})
\]  
Using Table A-2,  
\[
S_1 = m_1 S_f(100^\circ\text{C}) + x(S_g(100^\circ\text{C}) - S_f(100^\circ\text{C})) + m_2 S_f(20^\circ\text{C})
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
S_1 = m_1 (1.337 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}) + m_2 (0.2566 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}})
\]  

The entropy at state 2 is given by:  
\[
S_2 = S_f(70^\circ\text{C})
\]  
Using Table A-2:  
\[
S_2 = 0.9599 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
The total entropy at state 2 is:  
\[
S_2 = m_{g,2} S_2 = 8.753 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]  

The entropy change is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = S_2 - S_1 = 74 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]  

Note: The crossed-out value in the entropy change calculation is ignored.
