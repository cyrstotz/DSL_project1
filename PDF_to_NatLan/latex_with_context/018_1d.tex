The task involves determining \( \Delta m_{12} \), the mass of saturated liquid water added to the reactor during cooling, using an energy balance. The heat released during cooling is given as \( Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \times 10^3 \, \text{J} \).

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m}_{12} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W} = 0
\]

Rearranging for \( m_{12} \):  
\[
m_{12} - m_{u2} = \dot{m}_{12} (h_1 - h_2) + Q_{\text{out}}
\]

The enthalpy values are provided:  
\[
h_1 = h_2(20^\circ\text{C}) = 83.96 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
\[
h_2 = h_3(70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.98 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The internal energy values are also given:  
\[
u_2 = u_3(70^\circ\text{C}) = 1.0228 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
\[
u_1 = u_2(20^\circ\text{C}) = 1.0018 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
