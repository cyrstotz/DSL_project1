The temperature \( T_i \) in Step ii will decrease further but at an increasingly slower rate. It cannot decrease indefinitely because the system reaches thermal equilibrium.  

A sketch is provided showing the qualitative behavior of \( T \) over time \( t \):  
- The curve starts at a higher temperature and decreases steeply initially.
- The slope flattens as time progresses, indicating the slowing rate of temperature decrease.  

The diagram is labeled as "so ein Verlauf" (such a progression), with \( T \) on the vertical axis and \( t \) on the horizontal axis.
