The enthalpy at state 4 is calculated as:  
\[
h_4 = h_1 = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The pressure difference is calculated under the assumption that \( T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C} \):  
\[
p_1 - p_2 = 1.2192 \, \text{bar}
\]  

From Table A-10:  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = \frac{93.42 - 21.77}{234.08 - 21.77} = 0.837
\]
