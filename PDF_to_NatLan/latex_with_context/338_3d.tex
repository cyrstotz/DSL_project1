The energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
\Delta E_{12} = m(u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
The difference in specific internal energy is:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = -316.498 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
The work term is:  
\[
W_{12} = -0.386 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
Substituting into the energy balance equation:  
\[
m(u_2 - u_1) + W_{12} = Q_{12}
\]  
\[
Q_{12} = -1468 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
The mass is calculated as:  
\[
m = 3.42 \, \text{kg}
\]
