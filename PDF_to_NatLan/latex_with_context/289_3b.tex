The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is given as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.80094 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The pressure does not change because the system is closed and the same external pressure is still applied.  

It is valid that:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

There is still ice present (\( T < 0^\circ\text{C} \)), and no heat exchange occurs anymore.
