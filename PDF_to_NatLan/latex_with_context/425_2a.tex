The diagram is a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) plot illustrating the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. The process includes labeled isobars and states:  
- State 0 represents the ambient condition.  
- State 1 is the inlet to the compressor.  
- State 2 is the outlet of the compressor.  
- State 3 is the combustion chamber outlet.  
- State 5 is the mixing chamber outlet.  
- State 6 is the nozzle exit.  

The diagram shows the following:  
- Isobaric lines are drawn for \( p_0 \), \( p_1 = p_2 = p_5 \), and \( p_3 \).  
- The process from state 1 to state 2 is labeled as isentropic compression.  
- The process from state 3 to state 5 is labeled as isobaric heat addition.  
- The process from state 5 to state 6 is labeled as isentropic expansion.  
- The entropy axis (\( s \)) is labeled with units of \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).
