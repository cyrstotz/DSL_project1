The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1
\]  
where \( m_2 = 1.443 \, \text{kg} \), \( m_1 = 1402 \, \text{kg} \), and \( s_2 \) and \( s_1 \) are specific entropies.  

From the water table (A-2) at \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \), the specific entropy \( s_1 \) is given as:  
\[
s_1 = 135085 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  

The specific entropy \( s_2 \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
s_2 = \text{REFCTZ} \approx 0.95549 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  

Additional notes mention that the system is fully liquid and in steady-state conditions. The entropy values are derived from the saturated liquid properties at the given temperature.
