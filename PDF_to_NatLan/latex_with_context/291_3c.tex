The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the EW is calculated under isobaric conditions:  
\[
Q_{12} = \Delta E = m(u_2 - u_1) = Q_{\text{ab}} = \int_1^2 p \, dv = R T \int_1^2 \frac{1}{v} \, dv
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{\text{ab}} = m c_V (T_2 - T_1) = 0.00584 \, \text{J} = 5884 \, \text{mJ}
\]

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = m(u_2 - u_1) = Q_{\text{ab}} - W^0
\]  
The heat transferred (\( Q_{\text{ab}} \)) is calculated using:  
\[
Q_{\text{ab}} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_1 - T_2) = 1139.4 \, \text{J}
\]
