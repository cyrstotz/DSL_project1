The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta m_{12} \left[ h_2 \right] + \sum \dot{Q}_{12} - \sum \dot{W}_n
\]  
where kinetic and potential energy terms are neglected.  

The mass flow rate equation is expressed as:  
\[
m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_2 + Q_{R}
\]  
Rearranging terms:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_2 - m_1}{h_2 - h_1}
\]  
or equivalently:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_2 h_2 - m_1 h_1}{h_2 - h_1}
\]  

Given values:  
\[
Q_{12} = -35 \, \text{MJ}, \quad m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The specific internal energy \( u_1 \) is referenced at \( x_D = 0.005 \) and \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \), but the exact value is left as a question mark.
