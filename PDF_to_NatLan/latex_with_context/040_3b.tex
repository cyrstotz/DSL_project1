Given \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), the gas temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined.  

At state 2:  
Thermal equilibrium exists between the ice-water mixture (EW) and the gas, meaning no heat flow occurs. Therefore, the temperatures are equal:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is left undefined in the visible content.
