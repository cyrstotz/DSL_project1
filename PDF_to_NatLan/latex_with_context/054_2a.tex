The page begins with a graph illustrating a qualitative process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The graph includes labeled isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_5 \). The temperature axis ranges from \( T_0 = 253.15 \, \text{K} \) to \( T_5 = 328.07 \, \text{K} \), and the entropy axis is labeled \( s \). The graph shows curves representing different states of the jet engine process, including compression, combustion, and expansion.
