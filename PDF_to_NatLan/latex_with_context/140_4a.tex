A graph is drawn with pressure \( P \, [\text{bar}] \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \, [\text{K}] \) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts the phase regions of a substance, including solid, fluid, and gas phases.  
- Point 3 is marked in the gas region.  
- Point 2 is marked in the fluid region.  
- Point 1 is marked in the solid region.  
Arrows indicate transitions between these states.
