A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) in Kelvin, and the horizontal axis is labeled \( s \) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \). The diagram includes labeled points corresponding to states \( 0 \), \( 5 \), \( 6 \), and \( B \). The process lines connect these states, with dashed lines indicating isobars. The region is marked "Isobaren" (isobars).
