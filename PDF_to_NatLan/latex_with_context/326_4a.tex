The diagram represents the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram.  
- The phase regions for solid, liquid, and gas are labeled.  
- The triple point is marked as the intersection of the three phase boundaries.  
- A horizontal line is drawn below the triple point, indicating the sublimation process at a pressure lower than the triple point.  
- The temperature is labeled as \(T [^\circ C]\), and the pressure is labeled as \(p [\text{bar}]\).  
- The process includes two steps:  
  1. The system starts below the triple point.  
  2. The temperature is held 10 K above the sublimation point during the sublimation process.
