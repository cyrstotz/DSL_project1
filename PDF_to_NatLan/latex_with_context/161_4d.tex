The coefficient of performance (\(\epsilon_K\)) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
The heat transfer rate (\(\dot{Q}_K\)) is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left( h_3 - h_1 \right)
\]  
Where:  
- \(h_3\) and \(h_1\) are enthalpies at states 3 and 1, respectively.  
- \(p_1 = p_3\).  

Additional calculations:  
- \(h_2 = h_g(8 \, \text{bar}) = g_2 \frac{R}{M}\), using Table A11.  
- \(s_2 = s_3\), and \(s_2 = s_g(T_i - 6^\circ\text{C})\).  
- Vapor quality (\(x_1\)) is calculated as:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{s_2 - s_f(8 \, \text{bar})}{s_g(8 \, \text{bar}) - s_f(8 \, \text{bar})}
\]  
Where \(s_f\) and \(s_g\) are entropy values for saturated liquid and vapor at 8 bar.  

Enthalpy at state 3 (\(h_3\)) is determined as:  
\[
h_3 = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) + x \left( h_g(8 \, \text{bar}) - h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) \right)
\]  
Values for \(s_f\), \(s_g\), \(h_f\), and \(h_g\) are obtained from Table A11.
