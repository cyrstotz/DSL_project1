The process is described as follows:  
- \( 1 \to 2 \): Isobaric process  
- \( 2 \to 3 \): Isentropic process  
- \( 3 \to 4 \): Isobaric process  
- \( 4 \to 1 \): Isentropic process with enthalpy remaining constant  

Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. A qualitative \( p \)-\( T \) diagram showing the cycle with labeled regions corresponding to the processes described above.  
2. A detailed \( p \)-\( h \) diagram with labeled points (1, 2, 3, 4) and process paths:  
   - \( 1 \to 2 \): Isobaric evaporation  
   - \( 2 \to 3 \): Isentropic compression  
   - \( 3 \to 4 \): Isobaric condensation  
   - \( 4 \to 1 \): Isentropic expansion  
   The diagram includes annotations such as "ND" (possibly nozzle dynamics), "isotherm," "isobar," and "grade (fl√ºssig)" indicating liquid and gas phases.
