To determine \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \):  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are expected to reach equilibrium as the thermodynamic system achieves steady-state conditions. The temperature will equalize to \( T_{\text{EW}} \), and the pressure will adjust accordingly to maintain equilibrium.
