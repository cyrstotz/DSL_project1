This section is crossed out and therefore ignored.  

The remaining explanation states:  
The temperature and pressure remain constant:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},2} = T_{\text{EW},1} = 0^\circ \text{C}
\]  
\[
p_{G,2} = p_{G,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{M_{\text{Kolben}} \cdot g}{\pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2}
\]  
This is because the system operates in a two-phase region. Heat input leads to melting of ice without a change in temperature or pressure, as long as \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \).  

The temperature remains at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) because the ice is not completely melted, and the temperature of the ice-water mixture remains constant. No heat transfer occurs when \( T_{G,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0 \).  

The pressure also remains constant because the atmospheric pressure, the weight of the piston, and the ice-water mixture remain unchanged.
