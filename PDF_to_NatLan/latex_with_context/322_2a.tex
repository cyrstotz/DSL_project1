The graph depicts a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The x-axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \frac{\text{MJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \), and the y-axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process paths. Key features include:  
- A curved path representing the compression process.  
- A peak indicating the combustion process.  
- A descending curve for the turbine process.  
- Isobars are drawn as horizontal lines.

The diagram represents a qualitative T-s diagram for a jet engine process. The graph includes labeled isobars and key states:  
- State 1: Compression (adiabatic and reversible).  
- State 2: Combustion (isobaric heat addition).  
- State 3: Expansion in the turbine (adiabatic and irreversible).  
- State 4: Mixing and nozzle process.  

The vertical axis is labeled as \( T \) (temperature), and the horizontal axis is labeled as \( s \) (entropy). The process transitions are shown with arrows indicating the direction of change.  

Below the diagram, the text explains:  
- The compression process is adiabatic and reversible.  
- The combustion process is isobaric.  
- The turbine process involves irreversible adiabatic expansion.
