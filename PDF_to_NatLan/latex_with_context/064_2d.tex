The exergy destruction in the engine is calculated using the general exergy balance equation:  

\[
0 = \dot{E}_{\text{ex,dest}} + ex_q - W - p_0 \frac{dV}{dt} - ex_{\text{flow,in}}
\]

The specific exergy input from heat transfer is:  

\[
ex_q = \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_B} \right) \dot{q}_B = 969.52 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

Adding the exergy destruction term:  

\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = 969.52 + 100 = 1069.52 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
