The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and process states:  
- State 1: Start of the compression process.  
- State 2: End of the compression process, showing an increase in temperature and entropy.  
- State 3: Combustion process, represented as isobaric heat addition.  
- State 4: Expansion in the turbine, shown as an adiabatic process (\( s = \text{const} \)).  
- State 5: Mixing process, with entropy increasing.  
- State 6: Nozzle exit, showing adiabatic expansion (\( s = \text{const} \)).  

The diagram also includes arrows indicating the direction of processes and annotations such as "adiabatic \( s = \text{const} \)" and "isobaric \( p_0 = p_6 \)."
