The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{Q} - \dot{W} = 0
\]  

This simplifies to:  
\[
m_g \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (u_{1,\text{EW}} - u_{2,\text{EW}})
\]  

Where \( u_2 \) and \( u_1 \) represent the specific internal energies of the gas at states 2 and 1, respectively, and \( u_{1,\text{EW}} \) and \( u_{2,\text{EW}} \) represent the specific internal energies of the ice-water mixture at states 1 and 2, respectively.
