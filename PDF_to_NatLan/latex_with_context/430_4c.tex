The pressure at state 1 is given as \( p_1 = 8 \, \text{bar} \), and the vapor quality at state 1 is \( x_1 = 0 \).  

The heat transfer equation is written as:  
\[
Q_q = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \cdot h_{\text{fg}} = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The mass flow rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}}
\]
