A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows two distinct processes labeled as "i)" and "ii)".  
- Process "i)" is an isobaric line at constant pressure.  
- Process "ii)" is an isothermal line at constant temperature.  
The graph includes a point labeled "Triple" indicating the triple point of the substance.
