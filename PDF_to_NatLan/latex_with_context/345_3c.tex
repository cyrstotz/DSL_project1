The transferred heat \( Q_{12} \) from gas to EW between states 1 and 2 is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_{g,1} - T_{g,2})
\]  
Given:  
\[
c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/(kgÂ·K)}, \quad T_{g,1} = 773.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_{g,2} = 276.8 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
Q_{12} = 3.479 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.633 \cdot (773.15 - 276.8) = 1.673 \, \text{kJ}
\]
