The entropy balance is set up to determine the entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents during cooling.  

The entropy equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = Q \cdot \frac{1}{T} + S_{\text{env}}
\]  

This equation accounts for the entropy transfer due to heat flow and the entropy generated in the environment.
