The refrigerant mass flow rate (\(\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}}\)) is calculated using the enthalpy differences between states.  

At state 2:  
The refrigerant is saturated cooling vapor, and the enthalpy \(h_2\) is determined.  

At state 3:  
The pressure is \(p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar}\), and the enthalpy \(h_3\) is calculated using the saturated vapor enthalpy from Table A-11:  
\[
h_3 = 267.15 \, \text{kJ/kg}.
\]  

The work input to the compressor (\(\dot{W}_K\)) is given by:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) = \dot{W}_K.
\]  

At state 4:  
The refrigerant is fully condensed, and the enthalpy \(h_4\) is calculated as:  
\[
h_4 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}.
\]  

The heat removed by the condenser (\(\dot{Q}_{\text{ab}}\)) is given by:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot (h_3 - h_4) = \dot{Q}_{\text{ab}}.
\]
