The page contains mathematical expressions related to energy balance and thermodynamic calculations.  

1. The general energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = \sum_i \dot{m}_i(t) \left[ h_i(t) + \frac{v_i^2(t)}{2} + g z_i(t) \right] + \sum_j \dot{Q}_j(t) - \sum_k \dot{W}_k(t)
\]  
Where:  
- \( \dot{m}_i(t) \) represents mass flow rate.  
- \( h_i(t) \) is specific enthalpy.  
- \( v_i(t) \) is velocity.  
- \( z_i(t) \) is height.  
- \( \dot{Q}_j(t) \) is heat transfer rate.  
- \( \dot{W}_k(t) \) is work transfer rate.  

2. The work rate equation is given as:  
\[
\dot{W}_u = \dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right]
\]  

3. The temperature relationship is expressed as:  
\[
T_2 = T_1 - CU
\]  

4. Additional notes include:  
- \( p_1 = p_2 \)  
- \( p_3 = p_4 = \Delta p_{\text{min}} \)
