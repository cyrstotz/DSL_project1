The energy balance for the system is expressed as:  
\[
U_{12} = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
The heat transferred (\( Q_{12} \)) and work done (\( W_{12} \)) are related by:  
\[
Q_{12} = U_{12} + W_{12} = -4367.157 \, \text{J}
\]  
The internal energy change (\( U_{12} \)) is calculated using the specific heat capacity \( c_V \):  
\[
U_{12} = c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) \cdot m = -1082.868 \, \text{J}
\]  
Where \( c_V = 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  
The work done (\( W_{12} \)) is given by:  
\[
W_{12} = p \cdot (V_2 - V_1) \approx -284.189 \, \text{J}
\]
