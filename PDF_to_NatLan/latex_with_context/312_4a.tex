The pressure-temperature (\(p-T\)) diagram is drawn to represent the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes the following features:  
- A phase envelope showing the relationship between pressure and temperature.  
- The triple point is labeled, indicating the coexistence of solid, liquid, and vapor phases.  
- States 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked along the diagram, with arrows showing transitions between states.  
- The region labeled "Phasengebiet" (phase region) is highlighted.
