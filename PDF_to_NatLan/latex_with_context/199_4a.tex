The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p(T) \)) graph. It shows phase regions labeled as "solid" (\( \text{fest} \)), "liquid" (\( \text{fl√ºssig} \)), and "gas." The graph includes two steps:  
- Step i: A horizontal line indicating isobaric evaporation.  
- Step ii: A vertical line showing the pressure reduction below the triple point of water, leading to sublimation.
