The entropy change is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta S = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1 - \Delta m_{12} s_e = \frac{Q}{T} + S_{\text{res}}
\]  

Where:  
- \( \Delta m_{12} \) represents the mass added during cooling.  
- \( s_1, s_2, s_e \) are specific entropies at respective states.  
- \( Q \) is the heat released during cooling.  
- \( T \) is the temperature at which heat transfer occurs.  
- \( S_{\text{res}} \) accounts for residual entropy generation.
