The heat transfer \( \dot{Q} \) is zero.  
The energy balance equation for the system is:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i h_i + \dot{Q} + \dot{W}
\]  
Since \( \dot{Q} = 0 \), the equation simplifies to:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i h_i
\]  
For the cooling process from state 1 to state 2, the heat released is:  
\[
Q_{R,12} = Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \, \text{MJ}
\]  
The mass balance equation is:  
\[
m_{\text{total},2} - m_{\text{total},1} = \Delta m_{12}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12}
\]

The specific heat ratio \( \kappa = 1.4 \).  

The vapor quality \( x_2 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_g - u_f}
\]  

The internal energy \( u_2 \) is determined as:  
\[
u_2 = u_f + x_2 \cdot (u_g - u_f)
\]  
\[
= 0.633 - 273.47 = -273.10
\]
