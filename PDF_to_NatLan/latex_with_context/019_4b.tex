The equation for energy balance is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  
The process from \(2\) to \(3\) is described as adiabatic and reversible, leading to isentropic conditions.  

Additional notes:  
- \(p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar}\)  
- \(T_3\) is not explicitly provided.  
- \(s_3 = s_2\), indicating entropy remains constant between states \(2\) and \(3\).
