The energy change \( \Delta E \) is equal to the heat transferred \( Q_{12} \).  
\[
\Delta E = Q_{12}
\]  
The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
m_g u_2 - m_g u_1 = Q_{12}
\]  
Simplifying further:  
\[
m_g (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Using the specific heat capacity \( c_V \) and temperature difference:  
\[
m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
The calculated heat transfer is:  
\[
|Q_{12}| = 1083.38 \, \text{J}
\]
