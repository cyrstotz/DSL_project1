The mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) of saturated liquid water added to the reactor is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
m_{\text{gas}} (u_1 - u_2) - \Delta m_{12} u_2 = \Delta m_{12} h_{\text{e,in}}
\]  
Rearranging for \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_{\text{gas}} (u_1 - u_2)}{h_{\text{e,in}} + u_2} = 6.408 \, T
\]

The mass of the EW in state 2 is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
m_{\text{EW},2} (u_{\text{EW},2} - u_{\text{EW},1}) = \dot{Q}
\]  

The internal energy of the EW is expressed as:  
\[
u_{\text{EW},2} = u_{\text{EW},1} + x_2 (u_{\text{ice},2} - u_{\text{water},2})
\]  

The heat transfer is given as:  
\[
\dot{Q} = m_{\text{EW},2} (u_{\text{EW},2} - u_{\text{EW},1}) + x_2 (u_{\text{ice},2} - u_{\text{water},2})
\]  

The ice fraction in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{\dot{Q}}{m_{\text{EW},2} (u_{\text{ice},2} - u_{\text{water},2})}
\]  

The pressure in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_K g}{A} + \frac{m_{\text{EW},2} g}{A} = 2.9 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The ice fraction is determined as:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{-0.332 + 0.079}{(2.9 - 2) - 0.079} = -0.106 \, \text{kg}
\]
