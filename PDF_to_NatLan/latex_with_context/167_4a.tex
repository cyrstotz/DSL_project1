The graph is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. It shows the freeze-drying process with two steps labeled as "i" and "ii."  
- The x-axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in degrees Celsius (\( ^\circ \text{C} \)), ranging from approximately \(-70^\circ \text{C}\) to \( 20^\circ \text{C}\).  
- The y-axis represents pressure (\( p \)) in millibars (\( \text{mbar} \)), ranging from \( 0.1 \, \text{mbar} \) to \( 70 \, \text{mbar} \).  
- The curve labeled "Sublimationspunkt" (sublimation point) separates the "flüssig" (liquid) region from the "flüssig-gasförmig" (liquid-gaseous) region.  
- Step "i" is depicted as a horizontal line at a constant pressure, while step "ii" involves a vertical drop in pressure below the sublimation point.
