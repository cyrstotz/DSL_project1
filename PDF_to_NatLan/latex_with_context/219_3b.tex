The temperature of the ice-water mixture in state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_{\text{EW,2}} = T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  
This holds because thermodynamic equilibrium is established.  

The gas volume in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
V_{g,2} = V_{g,1} - \frac{m_{\text{EW}}}{\rho_{\text{EW}}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
V_{g,2} = 3.14 \, \text{L} - \frac{0.1 \, \text{kg}}{1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3} = 1.2362 \, \text{m}^3
\]  

The pressure in state 2 remains unchanged:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.0401 \, \text{bar}
\]  
This is because the gravitational force and external pressure do not change.
