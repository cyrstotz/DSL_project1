The gas pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} = 1.40 \, \text{bar} \), as the process is isobaric. This is because the weight of the EW or external pressure does not change.  

The energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
\Delta E = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad m_{\text{EW}} c (T_2 - T_{\text{EW}}) = m_g c_v (T_2 - T_{g,1})  
\]  
Rearranging for \( T_2 \):  
\[
T_2 = \frac{m_g c_v T_{g,1} - m_{\text{EW}} c T_{\text{EW}}}{m_g c_v - m_{\text{EW}} c}  
\]  
Substituting values, the resulting temperature is:  
\[
T_2 = 0.003^\circ \text{C}  
\]
