The initial temperature of the gas is given as \( T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} \). The initial volume of the gas is \( V_{g,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L} \). The specific heat capacity at constant volume is \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \), and the molar mass of the gas is \( M_g = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol} \).  

The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_K \cdot g}{\pi \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^2}
\]  
where \( p_{\text{amb}} \) is the ambient pressure, \( m_K \) is the mass of the piston, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( D \) is the diameter of the cylinder.  

The mass of the gas \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p \cdot V}{R \cdot T}
\]  
Substituting the values, the calculation gives \( m_g = 3.619 \, \text{g} \).
