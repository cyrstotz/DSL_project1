The mass flow rate of the refrigerant \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is calculated using the energy balance equation:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) + Q_{23}^{\text{adiabat}} - \dot{W}_K
\]  
where:  
- \( h_2 \) is the enthalpy at state 2, calculated as \( h_2 = h_f + x_2 (h_g - h_f) \), with \( s_2 = s_3 \) and \( p_2 = p_4 \).  
- \( h_3 \) is the enthalpy at state 3, given as \( h_3 = h(8 \, \text{bar}) \).
