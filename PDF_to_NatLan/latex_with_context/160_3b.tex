The ice fraction in state 2 is given as \( x_{\text{ice},2} \geq 0 \). The initial ice fraction is \( x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.6 \).  

The mass of ice \( m_{\text{ice}} \) is calculated as:  
\[
m_{\text{ice}} = x_{\text{ice},1} \cdot m_{\text{EW}} = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 \, \text{kg} = 0.06 \, \text{kg}.
\]  

Thermodynamic reasoning:  
Since the densities of ice and water are equal, the mass (and volume) of the ice-water mixture does not change. From the equilibrium condition, it is evident that \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \). Thus:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}.
\]

The mass of the ice-water mixture (EW) is equal to the mass of the gas:  
\[
m_{g,1} = m_{g,2} = 3.422 \, \text{g}
\]  

Since the ice-water mixture can be treated as water in equilibrium with vapor, and \( x_2 > 0 \), the temperature of the ice-water mixture in state 2 is:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},2} = T_{\text{EW},1} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

For thermodynamic equilibrium, the gas temperature must also equal the ice-water temperature:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]
