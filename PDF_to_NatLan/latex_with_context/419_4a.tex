A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as \( T [K] \) and the y-axis labeled as \( h [\text{kJ}] \). The graph includes several curves and points, with labels indicating states \( 1 \) and \( 2 \). The curves appear to represent thermodynamic processes, possibly phase transitions or heat transfer, with arrows indicating directionality.
