The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is calculated as:  
\[
A = \pi \frac{D^2}{4} = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  

The pressure in state 1 is given by:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{m_{\text{EW}} g}{A} + \frac{m_K g}{A} + p_{\text{amb}} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The mass of the gas in state 1 is determined using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,1} V_{g,1} = m_g R T_{g,1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1} M_g}{R T_{g,1}} = 0.108 \, \text{kg}
\]
