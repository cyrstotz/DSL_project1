A graph is drawn, resembling a T-s diagram. The graph includes the following annotations:  
- A curve labeled "Sublimation" with an upward slope.  
- A point labeled "1" near the sublimation curve.  
- A point labeled "2" further along the curve.  
- Arrows indicating transitions between states.  
- The axes are not explicitly labeled, but the curve suggests temperature and entropy relationships.  

No additional textual explanation is provided for the graph.
