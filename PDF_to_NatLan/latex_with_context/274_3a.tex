The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
p_g = p_0 + \frac{F}{A}
\]  
The result is:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas constant \( R \) is determined as:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M} = 0.16628 \, \text{kJ/(kgÂ·K)}
\]  

The mass of the gas \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
PV = mRT \quad \Rightarrow \quad m_g = \frac{p_g V_g}{R T_g} = 3.42 \, \text{g}
\]
