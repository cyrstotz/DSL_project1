The exergy destruction for the entire system is calculated using the exergy balance equation. The steady-state assumption is applied:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \Delta ex_{\text{st}} + \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_B}\right) \dot{Q}_B - \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{total}} = -\Delta ex_{\text{st}} + C_p \left(\frac{T_0}{T_B}\right) \cdot 98 - 948.8 \, \text{kW}
\]  
The final result is:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{total}} = 948.8 \, \text{kW}
\]  

Additional notes:  
- \( p_0 = p_6 \) is used in the calculation for the nozzle.  
- \( \dot{Q}_B \) is the heat input during combustion.
