The temperature at state 2 is \( T_2 = 70^\circ\text{C} \), and the mass flow rate of the inlet is zero (\( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} = 0 \)).  

The added mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) at \( T_{\text{in,12}} = 20^\circ\text{C} \) is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
Q_{R,12} = Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \, \text{MJ}
\]  

Energy balance for the water system:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{R,12} = \Delta m_{12} \cdot (u_2 - u_1)
\]  
Where:  
- \( u_2 \) at \( T_2 = 70^\circ\text{C} \): \( u_2 = 292.95 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \) (from Table A-2)  
- \( u_1 \) at \( T_1 = 100^\circ\text{C} \): \( u_1 = 418.84 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \) (from Table A-2)  

Rearranging for \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{Q_{R,12}}{u_2 - u_1}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{-35.00 \, \text{kJ}}{292.95 - 418.84 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}}
\]  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = 277.8 \, \text{kg}
\]  

Note: Some equations and calculations are crossed out and not considered in the transcription.

The problem involves calculating the mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) of saturated liquid water added to the reactor during cooling from state 1 to state 2 using an energy balance.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_{\text{in}} + Q_{\text{out}}
\]  

Rearranging the equation to isolate \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{12} h_{\text{in}} - (\Delta m_{12} u_2) = m_1 u_1 + Q_{\text{out}} - m_2 u_2
\]  

Simplifying further:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} (h_{\text{in}} - u_2) = m_1 u_1 - Q_{\text{out}} + u_2 m_2
\]  

Thus, \( \Delta m_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_1 u_1 - Q_{\text{out}} + u_2 m_2}{h_{\text{in}} - u_2}
\]  

Values for specific enthalpy and internal energy are provided from water tables:  
\[
h_{\text{in}} = 83.96 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(Table A-2 at \( 20^\circ\text{C} \))}  
\]  
\[
u_1 = 418.94 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(Table A-2 at \( 100^\circ\text{C} \))}  
\]  
\[
u_2 = 292.55 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(Table A-2 at \( 20^\circ\text{C} \))}  
\]  

The heat released during cooling is given as:  
\[
Q_{\text{out}} = -35 \, \text{MJ}
\]  

These values will be substituted into the equation to calculate \( \Delta m_{12} \).
