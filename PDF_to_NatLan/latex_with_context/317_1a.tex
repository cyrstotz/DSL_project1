The entropy balance is expressed as:  
\[
0 = \sum_i \frac{\dot{Q}_i}{T_s} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
A diagram is included showing a rectangular system with labeled heat flows \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) and \( \dot{Q}_{\text{in}} \), as well as temperatures \( T_{\text{KF,in}} \), \( T_{\text{KF,out}} \), and \( T_{\text{Reactor}} \). The arrows indicate the direction of heat transfer.
