The problem involves calculating \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \), the heat flow removed by the coolant.  

The coolant is modeled as an ideal liquid, and the energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}_{\text{in}}
\]  
where \( \dot{W}_{\text{in}} = 0 \) due to constant pressure.  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_a - h_e)
\]  

The enthalpy difference \( h_a - h_e \) is calculated using the specific heat capacity:  
\[
h_a - h_e = c_p \cdot (T_a - T_e)
\]  

For the reactor energy balance:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{W}_{\text{in}}
\]  
where \( \dot{W}_{\text{in}} = 0 \).  

The heat flow removed by the reactor is:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_a - h_e) + 100 \, \text{kW}
\]  

The enthalpy \( h_e \) is unknown and needs to be determined.  

From Table A-1:  
\[
h_f = 259.98 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}, \quad h_g = 2626.8 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The specific volume \( v_e \) is also referenced but not explicitly calculated on this page.
