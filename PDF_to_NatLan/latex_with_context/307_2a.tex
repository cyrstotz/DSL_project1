The page contains two diagrams related to Task 2a.  

**Description of the first diagram:**  
The first diagram is a qualitative T-s diagram (temperature vs. entropy) representing the jet engine process. The following points and processes are labeled:  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curve.  
- The process between points 0 and 1 is labeled as "isentropic."  
- The process between points 1 and 2 is labeled as "isobaric."  
- The process between points 2 and 3 is labeled as "isentropic."  
- The process between points 3 and 4 is labeled as "isobaric."  
- The process between points 4 and 5 is labeled as "isentropic."  
- The process between points 5 and 6 is labeled as "isentropic."  

The diagram shows a series of curves and straight lines connecting the points, with arrows indicating the direction of the processes. The x-axis is labeled as entropy (\( s \)) in units of \( \text{kJ}/\text{kg·K} \), and the y-axis is labeled as temperature (\( T \)) in unspecified units.  

**Description of the second diagram:**  
The second diagram is another representation of the jet engine process, also plotted on a T-s diagram. The following points and processes are labeled:  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curve.  
- The process between points 0 and 1 is labeled as "isentropic."  
- The process between points 1 and 2 is labeled as "isobaric."  
- The process between points 2 and 3 is labeled as "isentropic."  
- The process between points 3 and 4 is labeled as "isobaric."  
- The process between points 4 and 5 is labeled as "isentropic."  
- The process between points 5 and 6 is labeled as "isentropic."  

The x-axis is labeled as entropy (\( s \)) in units of \( \text{kJ}/\text{kg·K} \), and the y-axis is labeled as temperature (\( T \)) in unspecified units.  

Both diagrams are consistent with the qualitative T-s diagram requested in Task 2a, showing the thermodynamic processes of the jet engine cycle.
