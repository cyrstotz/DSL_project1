The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_i \dot{m}_i \left( h_i(1) + \frac{v_i^2(1)}{2} + g z_i(1) \right) + \sum_i \dot{Q}_j(1) - \sum_i \dot{W}(1)
\]  

The difference between states 2 and 1 is described as:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = \text{mean value of } u_{\text{in}} - \text{law of } Q_{\text{out}} + Q_R
\]
