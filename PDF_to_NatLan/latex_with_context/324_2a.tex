A graph is drawn representing the jet engine process on a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is \( s \) (specific entropy in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)).  

The diagram includes several curves representing isobars (constant pressure lines), labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), and \( p_2 \). A process path is drawn, connecting points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The path includes:  
- Compression from state 0 to state 1.  
- Adiabatic compression from state 1 to state 2.  
- Isobaric heat addition from state 2 to state 3.  
- Expansion through the turbine from state 3 to state 4.  
- Mixing from state 4 to state 5.  
- Expansion through the nozzle from state 5 to state 6.
