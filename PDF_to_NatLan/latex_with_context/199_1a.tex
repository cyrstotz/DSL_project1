The energy balance equation for the reactor is written as:  
\[
\dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a \right) = \dot{Q} + \dot{W}
\]  
where \(\dot{m}\) is the mass flow rate, \(h_e\) is the enthalpy at the outlet, \(h_a\) is the enthalpy at the inlet, \(\dot{Q}\) is the heat flow, and \(\dot{W}\) is the work done.  

The work term \(\dot{W}\) is neglected, leading to:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a \right) + \dot{Q}
\]  

The enthalpy values are determined from the water tables (Table A-2):  
\[
h_e = h \left( 70^\circ\text{C} \right) = 292.98 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
h_a = h \left( 100^\circ\text{C} \right) = 419.04 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The heat flow \(\dot{Q}\) is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \left( h_a - h_e \right)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{Q} = 0.3 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}} \left( 419.04 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - 292.98 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \right) = 37.81 \, \text{kW}
\]  

The heat removed by the coolant \(\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}\) is calculated as:  
\[
-\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{Q} - \dot{Q}_R
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
-\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 37.81 \, \text{kW} - 100 \, \text{kW}
\]  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = -62.78 \, \text{kW}
\]  

Thus, the heat removed by the coolant is:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 62.78 \, \text{kW}
\]
