The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q - W
\]  
For an isolated system, \( Q = 0 \) and \( W = 0 \), so:  
\[
\Delta E = 0
\]  
The change in internal energy is given by:  
\[
\Delta E = m_g (u_2 - u_1)
\]  
For a perfect gas, this simplifies to:  
\[
\Delta E = m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

Since the process is isochoric, the specific volume remains constant:  
\[
V_{g,1} = V_{g,2}
\]  

The final gas pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is calculated using:  
\[
p_{g,2} = \frac{m_g R T_{g,2}}{V_{g,1}}
\]
