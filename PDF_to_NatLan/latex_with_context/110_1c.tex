The entropy production rate \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is given by:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = ?
\]  

The entropy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = 0 = \dot{m} \, (s_e - s_a) + \sum \frac{\dot{Q}_j}{T_j} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  

This equation accounts for the entropy flow due to mass transfer, heat transfer, and entropy generation.
