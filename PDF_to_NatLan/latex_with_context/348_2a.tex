The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram illustrating the jet engine process. It includes labeled isobars and process states:  
- State 1: Adiabatic compression.  
- State 2: Bypass and core split.  
- State 3: Combustion.  
- State 5: Mixing chamber.  
- State 6: Nozzle exit.  
The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (entropy) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \) on the horizontal axis. The isobars are marked as \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), and \( p_6 = p_0 \).
