From Table A-15, interpolation is used to calculate the mass flow rate of the refrigerant:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h_3 - h_1}
\]  
where \( \dot{Q}_K \) is the heat removed, and \( h_3 \) and \( h_1 \) are specific enthalpies.  
The calculation yields:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \approx 4 \, \text{kg/h}.
\]
