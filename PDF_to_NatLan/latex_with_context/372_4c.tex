The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{l}
\]  
where \( l \) represents the specific latent heat.  

The temperature at state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is to be determined.  

The entropy at state 1 is expressed as:  
\[
s_1 = s_{g,1} = s_{l,1,f}
\]  

The pressure at state 1 is:  
\[
p_1 = 5 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Using the entropy data for \( s_{l,1,f} \) at \( 5 \, \text{bar} \):  
\[
s_{l,1,f}(5 \, \text{bar}) = 0.3455 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  

From Table A-11, the entropy difference is calculated:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{s_1 - s_{l,1,f}}{s_{g,1} - s_{l,1,f}}
\]  

The heat transfer rate is expressed as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_{g,1} - h_{l,1})
\]
