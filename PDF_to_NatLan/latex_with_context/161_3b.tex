The pressure \( p_g \) in state 2 is equal to the pressure \( p_{\text{amb}} \):  
\[
p_g = p_{\text{amb}}
\]  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to the equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{EW}} \):  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}}
\]  

The ice-water mixture (EW) is incompressible, so the pressure in EW does not change. The equilibrium between EW and gas ensures that \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}} \). At \( T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} \), the system is in equilibrium, and the mixture consists of solid and liquid phases.
