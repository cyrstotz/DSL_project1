The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) plot illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes labeled phase regions and key states (1, 2, 3, and 4).  
- State 1: Located in the wet vapor region.  
- State 2: Transitioning through the wet vapor region.  
- State 3: Isobaric compression to the superheated vapor region.  
- State 4: Isobaric condensation back to the liquid phase.  
The process involves isobaric and adiabatic transformations, with arrows indicating the direction of the cycle.
