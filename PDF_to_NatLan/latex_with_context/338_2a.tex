The page begins with a graph labeled as a \( T \)-\( S \) diagram. The graph illustrates the thermodynamic process of a jet engine, with states labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The graph includes isobars (constant pressure lines) labeled \( p_0 = p_6 \), \( p_2 = p_3 \), and \( p_4 = p_5 \). The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and \( S \) (entropy in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \)) on the horizontal axis.

The equation for exergy balance is written as:  
\[
0 = m_{\text{ges}} \Delta ex_{\text{strom}} + \dot{Z} - \dot{W} - \dot{Ex}_{\text{verl}}
\]  

The work output is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{W}_{\text{out}} =
\]  

The exergy loss is given by:  
\[
\dot{Ex}_{\text{verl}} = m_{\text{ges}} \Delta ex_{\text{strom}} - \dot{W}
\]
