A graph is drawn showing pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The curve represents the phase diagram of a substance, with a labeled "Triple Point" where the three phases coexist. The graph qualitatively illustrates the freeze-drying process steps i and ii.
