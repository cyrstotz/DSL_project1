The entropy balance for state 2 is expressed as:  

\[
0 = m_{\text{aus}} \left( S_{\text{em}} - S_{\text{aus}} \right) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{aus}}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{erz}}
\]

Below this equation, the entropy at the inlet \( S_{\text{in}} \) is indicated but not further elaborated.

Several equations and diagrams are partially visible but crossed out. These include expressions for heat transfer and temperature relationships, such as:  
\[
Q_{\text{EW}} + Q_{g,1} = Q_{g,2} + Q_{\text{EW},2}.
\]  
Other crossed-out equations involve entropy and temperature ratios:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{g,1}, \quad \frac{p_{g,2}}{p_{g,1}} = \left(\frac{T_{g,2}}{T_{g,1}}\right)^{\kappa - 1}.
\]  

A small diagram shows intersecting lines labeled with \( T_{g,2} \), \( T_{g,1} \), \( p_{g,2} \), and \( p_{g,1} \), but it is crossed out and not fully legible.

The heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the formula:  
\[
Q_{1 \to 2} = m_g \cdot c_p \cdot (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1})
\]  
where \( c_p = k \cdot c_V = 0.8 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} \).  

Substituting the values:  
\[
Q_{1 \to 2} = 3.6 \, \text{g} \cdot 0.8 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} \cdot (0.003^\circ\text{C} - 500^\circ\text{C})
\]  
\[
Q_{1 \to 2} = -1.44 \, \text{kJ}
\]
