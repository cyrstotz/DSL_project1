The equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{EW},2} \) is equal to \( T_{g,2} \), as the system reaches thermal equilibrium.  

The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},1} + x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{u_2 - u_{\text{frost}}}{u_{\text{fl√ºssig}} - u_{\text{frost}}}
\]  
where all values are taken at \( p = 1 \, \text{bar} \) and \( T = 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The heat \( Q_{12} \) is equal to the change in internal energy \( \Delta U \), as the process is isochoric:  
\[
Q_{12} = \Delta U = u_2 - u_1
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = u_1 + \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}} = -133.2 \, \text{kJ/kg} + \frac{1.500 \, \text{kJ}}{0.1 \, \text{kg}}
\]  
\[
u_2 = -118.2 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Finally, the ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is determined as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.555
\]
