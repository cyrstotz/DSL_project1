The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{123} \cdot (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{aus}}) + Q_{12} = 0
\]  
Here, \( Q_{12} \) represents the heat transfer, and \( h_{\text{in}} \) and \( h_{\text{aus}} \) are enthalpies.  

The enthalpy difference is expressed as:  
\[
Q_{12} = \dot{m}_{123} \cdot (h_{\text{in}} - h_1) \quad \Rightarrow \quad Q_{12} = \dot{m}_{123} \cdot (h_2 - h_1)
\]  

The process steps are described:  
- From state 1 to state 2: Isobaric evaporation occurs at constant temperature (\( T_v \)) with saturated vapor.  
- From state 2 to state 3: Adiabatic and reversible compression occurs.  

The mass flow rate equation is given as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{123} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{Q}_K = \dot{W}_K
\]  
Rearranging for the mass flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m}_{123} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

The work input for the compressor is specified as:  
\[
\dot{W}_K = -28 \, \text{W}
\]  

Additional notes mention difficulties in finding \( h_3 \) at 8 bar. The entropy values are noted as:  
\[
s_2 = s_3
\]
