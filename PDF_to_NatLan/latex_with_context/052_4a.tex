Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a rectangular cycle labeled "1, 2, 3, 4" on a \( p \)-\( T \) graph. The x-axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), and the y-axis is labeled \( p \, [\text{bar}] \). The cycle appears to represent a refrigeration process with isobaric and adiabatic transitions.  
2. The second diagram is a phase diagram with curved lines representing phase boundaries. The x-axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), and the y-axis is labeled \( p \, [\text{bar}] \). Points "1, 2, 3, 4" are marked, showing transitions between phases.
