The energy balance equation for the refrigerant cycle is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) + \dot{Q}_K - W_K
\]  
This equation accounts for the mass flow rate of R134a (\(\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}}\)), the enthalpy difference between states 2 and 3 (\(h_2 - h_3\)), the heat removed (\(\dot{Q}_K\)), and the work done by the compressor (\(W_K\)). The system is described as stationary, meaning there is no accumulation of energy over time.
