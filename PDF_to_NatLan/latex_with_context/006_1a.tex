The energy balance for the reactor is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_R + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  
where:  
- \( h_1 \) corresponds to the enthalpy at \( T_1 = 70^\circ\text{C} \), which is saturated liquid.  
  \( h_1 = 292.98 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).  
- \( h_2 \) corresponds to the enthalpy at \( T_2 = 100^\circ\text{C} \), which is also saturated liquid.  
  \( h_2 = 419.04 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is calculated as:  
\[
-\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 0.3 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}} \left( 292.98 - 419.04 \right) + 100 \, \text{kW}
\]  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = -62.182 \, \text{kW}
\]
