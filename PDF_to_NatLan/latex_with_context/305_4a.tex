A p-T diagram is drawn, showing the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes labeled phase regions: "solid," "gasf√∂rmig" (gaseous), and "ND" (likely referring to the triple point or phase transition region). The diagram indicates isochoric and isobaric processes, as well as the transition between states (labeled i, ii, iii, and iv). The x-axis is labeled as \( T \, [K] \), and the y-axis is labeled as \( p \, [\text{bar}] \).
