The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and process steps:  
- State 1 to 2: Adiabatic reversible compression.  
- State 2 to 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 3 to 4: Adiabatic reversible expansion in the turbine.  
- State 4 to 5: Mixing of bypass and core streams, resulting in a pressure of \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- State 5 to 6: Adiabatic reversible expansion in the nozzle, ending at ambient pressure \( 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  

The diagram also shows arrows indicating the flow of mass (\( \dot{m}_K \) and \( \dot{m}_M \)) and heat transfer (\( \dot{Q}_B \)).
