A graph is drawn representing a qualitative T-s diagram for the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and states:  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_4 \), \( p_5 \), \( p_m \), \( p_0 = p_6 \).  
- The curve between states 5 and 6 is labeled "richtlinie" (guideline).  
The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and \( S \) (entropy), with units \( \left[\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}\right] \).
