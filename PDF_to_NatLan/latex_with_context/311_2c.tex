The mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_{\text{flow},6} - ex_{\text{flow},0}
\]  
This is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = h_6 - h_0 - T_0(s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2}
\]  

The enthalpy difference \( h_6 - h_0 \) is calculated using:  
\[
h_6 - h_0 = c_{p,\text{air}}^{\text{is}} (T_6 - T_0) = 85.84434 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The entropy difference \( s_6 - s_0 \) is calculated as:  
\[
s_6 - s_0 = c_{p,\text{air}} \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right)
\]  
Given \( p_6 = p_0 \), the second term vanishes, leaving:  
\[
s_6 - s_0 = c_{p,\text{air}} \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) = 0.30136 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

Substituting these values, the flow exergy increase is:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_{\text{flow},6} - ex_{\text{flow},0} = 120.247 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
