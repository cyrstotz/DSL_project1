The second diagram is another \( T \)-\( s \) representation of the jet engine process, with additional details:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \).  

The process includes the following states:  
1. Starting at state 1, the curve rises to state 2, representing compression.  
2. From state 2 to state 3, the curve moves horizontally, indicating isobaric heat addition.  
3. The curve drops from state 3 to state 4, representing adiabatic expansion.  
4. From state 4 to state 5, the curve moves horizontally again, indicating mixing.  
5. The process ends at state 6, with a slight rise in entropy.  

The diagram includes labeled isobars \( p_1 = p_3 \), \( p_5 = p_6 \), which curve downward.
