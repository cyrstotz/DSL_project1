The system is described as a semi-open system. The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta m_{12} h_{12} + Q_{R,12} + Q_{\text{out},12}
\]  
From the mass balance:  
\[
m_{12} - m_{11} = \Delta m_{12}
\]  
Rearranging gives:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_{12} h_{12} - m_{11} h_{11}}{h_{12}}
\]  

The enthalpy values are calculated as follows:  
\[
h_{11} = u_f(100^\circ\text{C}) + x_D (u_g - u_f) = 429.378 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
h_{12} = u_f(70^\circ\text{C}) + x_0 (u_g - u_f) = 303.368 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The mass \( m_{12} \) is given as:  
\[
m_{12} = m_{11} + \Delta m_{12}
\]  

The enthalpy \( h_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
h_{12} = h_{11} + h_{12} = 126.06 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Substituting into the mass balance equation:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_{12} h_{12} - m_{11} h_{11}}{h_{12}}
\]  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_{12} h_{12} - m_{11} h_{11}}{h_{12} \left(1 + \frac{1}{h_{12}}\right)} = \frac{h_{12} - h_{11}}{h_{12}}
\]  
The final result for \( \Delta m_{12} \) is:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = 5680 \, \text{kg}
\]
