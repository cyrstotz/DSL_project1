The task involves calculating the mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \).  

Exergy balance:  
\[
ex_{\text{str}} = \left[ h - h_0 - T_0 (s - s_0) \right] + \frac{w^2}{2}
\]  

Mass-specific exergy destruction:  
\[
ex_{\text{str}} = \int_{T_0}^{T} c_p (T) dT - T_0 \int_{T_0}^{T} c_p \frac{dT}{T} - R \ln \left( \frac{p}{p_0} \right) + \frac{w^2}{2}
\]  

Some terms are crossed out, but the general form of the exergy destruction equation is visible.  

No further numerical results are provided for this subtask.
