The energy balance for the entire turbine is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a) - \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}} - \dot{W}_b
\]  
This equation is partially crossed out and not fully legible.  

The energy balance for the nozzle is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2}) + \dot{Q} \quad \text{(adiabatic, isobaric)}
\]  

Further, the entropy balance for the nozzle is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (s_5 - s_6) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T}
\]  
This equation is labeled as "adiabatic reversible."  

The entropy change is calculated as:  
\[
s_5 - s_6 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_5}{T_6} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_5}{p_6} \right) = 0
\]  

The temperature \( T_6 \) is determined as:  
\[
T_6 = 328.675 \, \text{K}
\]  

The enthalpy difference \( h_5 - h_6 \) is calculated using:  
\[
h_5 - h_6 = c_p (T_5 - T_6) = 109.998 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated as:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 (h_5 - h_6) + w_5^2} = 507.29 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\]
