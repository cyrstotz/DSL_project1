The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{|W_E|}
\]  

The work done by the compressor \( W_E^{\text{rev}} \) is expressed as:  
\[
W_E^{\text{rev}} = - \int_{1}^{2} v \, dp
\]  

Additionally, the specific work \( W_E' \) is given by:  
\[
W_E' = \frac{W_E^{\text{rev}}}{\dot{m}_E}
\]
