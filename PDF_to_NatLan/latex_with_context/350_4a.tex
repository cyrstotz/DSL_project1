A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) (in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in degrees Celsius) on the horizontal axis. The curve represents the relationship between \( p \) and \( T \), with a labeled region indicating "ND" (likely referring to a phase region). The graph suggests that \( p \) and \( T \) are correlated.  

Below the main graph, a smaller sketch labeled "PVT" is drawn, showing a three-dimensional representation of pressure \( p \), volume \( V \), and temperature \( T \).
