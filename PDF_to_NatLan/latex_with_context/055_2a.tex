The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram representing the jet engine process. It includes labeled isobars and states:  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_4 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_1 = p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The entropy \( s_1 = s_2 \) is constant for the compression process.  
- The combustion process increases entropy, transitioning from state 3 to state 4.  
- The turbine process reduces entropy from state 4 to state 5.  
- The nozzle process transitions from state 5 to state 6, where \( p_6 = p_0 \).  

The diagram also shows temperature values:  
- \( T_1 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \), \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  
- The process paths are drawn qualitatively, with arrows indicating the direction of flow.  

A table is included with columns labeled \( p \), \( T \), \( v \), \( \dot{Q} \), and \( \dot{W} \). It lists values for states 1 through 6, with some entries left blank.  

Additional notes mention:  
- \( w_{\text{out}} = 200 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- \( \eta_{\text{vs}} < 1 \).
