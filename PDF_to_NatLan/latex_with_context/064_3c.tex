Thermal equilibrium is established between the gas and the ice-water mixture. The heat transfer equation is written as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
or equivalently:  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot (h_1 - h_2) + Q_{\text{EW}} - W
\]  

In the final state, the temperature of the gas is \( T_2 = 0^\circ\text{C} \), and the pressure is \( p_{g,2} = 1 \, \text{bar} = p_0 \). The volumes of the chambers remain constant:  
\[
V_1 = V_2
\]  

No further calculations are provided for \( Q_{12} \).
