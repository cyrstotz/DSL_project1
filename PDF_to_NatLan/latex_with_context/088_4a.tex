The graph is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. It shows the freeze-drying process with labeled points corresponding to different states. The diagram includes phase regions and transitions between states. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are connected by arrows to represent the process steps. The axes are labeled as \( p \) (pressure) and \( T \) (temperature).
