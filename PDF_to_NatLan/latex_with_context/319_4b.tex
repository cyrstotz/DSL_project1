The energy balance equation for the refrigerant is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i (h_i + ke_i + pe_i) + \sum \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}
\]  
For the specific case, the equation simplifies to:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_2 - h_3) + 28 \, W
\]  
The enthalpy at state 2 (\(h_2\)) is calculated using the relation:  
\[
h_2 = h_3 (T = T_i - 6 \, \text{K})
\]  
Interpolation is required for \(h_3\) using the refrigerant tables.
