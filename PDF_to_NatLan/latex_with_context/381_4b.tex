The table outlines the states of the refrigerant during the freeze-drying process:  
- **State 1**: \( p_1 = p_2 \), described as "flowing."  
- **State 2**: "Damp," with \( s_2 = s_3 \) and labeled as "reversible adiabatic."  
- **State 3**: Pressure is 8 bar.  
- **State 4**: \( x_4 = 0 \), described as "flowing."  

An equation for the heat transfer is provided:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_R (h_2 - h_3)
\]  
Additional terms include:  
\[
\dot{W}_R = 81.258 \, \text{kW}
\]
