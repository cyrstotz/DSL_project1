The diagram is a T-s diagram representing the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine. The x-axis is labeled as entropy \( S \) in \( \text{kgÂ·K} \), and the y-axis is labeled as temperature \( T \) in \( ^\circ\text{C} \).  
- The diagram includes labeled points: \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \).  
- The process between points \( 0 \) and \( 1 \) is marked as irreversible compression.  
- The process between points \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) is isobaric heat addition.  
- The process between points \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) is reversible adiabatic expansion.  
- The process between points \( 3 \) and \( 4 \) is isobaric cooling.  
- The process between points \( 5 \) and \( 6 \) is labeled as isobaric with \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).
