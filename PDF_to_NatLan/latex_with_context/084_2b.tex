To determine \( w_6 \) and \( T_6 \):  
The air is modeled as an ideal gas. The specific gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{c_{p,\text{air}}}{\kappa - 1} = \frac{8.314 \, \text{kJ/(kmol·K)}}{28.97 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kg/mol}} = 287 \, \text{J/(kg·K)}.
\]  

For the isentropic process \( 5 \to 6 \), the entropy remains constant (\( s_6 = s_5 \)). Using the given values:  
\[
p_5 = 0.5 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa}, \quad T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}.
\]  
From Table A-22, the corresponding values for \( T_6 \) and \( w_6 \) can be determined.
