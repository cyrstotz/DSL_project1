The energy balance equation is used to determine the mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) added to the reactor:  
\[
\Delta E = Q - W = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1
\]  
Since \( W = 0 \) and \( v = \text{const} \), the equation simplifies to:  
\[
m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m \cdot h_f(20^\circ\text{C}) + Q_R
\]  

The total mass at state 2 is:  
\[
m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m
\]  

At state 2, \( x_2 = 0 \), \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \), and the specific internal energy \( u_4(70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.95 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) (from Table A-2).  

A small sketch is included showing the heat flow \( Q_R = 35 \, \text{MJ} \).
