The heat transfer is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
m (u_2 - u_1) = \dot{Q}
\]  
Substituting the specific heat capacity \( c_V \):  
\[
m c_V (T_2 - T_1) = \dot{Q}
\]  
With values:  
\[
3.42 \, \text{g} \cdot 0.963 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot (273.153 \, \text{K} - 773.15 \, \text{K}) = \dot{Q}
\]  
This results in:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{12} = -1.082 \, \text{kJ}
\]

The page contains mathematical calculations related to heat transfer. The equations are as follows:

\[
\frac{Q}{V} =
\]

\[
(1000 \, \text{W}) \cdot \frac{2}{\text{m}} = 2 \cdot W = 0.4 \cdot x
\]

\[
\frac{Q}{V} = 85.598 =
\]

\[
\frac{Q}{V} = 85.598 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{\text{m}} - V \right) =
\]

\[
Q \cdot \left( \frac{2}{\text{m}} - V \right) = 9.45 \cdot x = 
\]

The last equation appears partially crossed out, and the term "Scheinungsdruck" is written but unclear due to crossing out.
