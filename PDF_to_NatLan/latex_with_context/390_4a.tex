A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn. The diagram includes the following features:  
- A curve labeled "i)" representing the isobaric evaporation process.  
- A curve labeled "ii)" representing the sublimation process.  
- A point labeled "Triple point" where the phase equilibrium occurs.  
- Axes are labeled as \( p \) (pressure) and \( T \) (temperature), with \( T \) in degrees Celsius (\( ^\circ\text{C} \)).
