The calculation begins with the expression for the outlet velocity \( w_6 \):  
\[
1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \left( 431.9 \, \text{K} - 328.1 \, \text{K} \right) - 74.51 \, \text{kW} + \frac{w_0^2}{2} = \frac{w_6^2}{2}
\]  
From this, the outlet velocity squared is calculated:  
\[
w_6^2 = 54122.8
\]  
The outlet velocity is then determined:  
\[
w_6 = 329 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\]
