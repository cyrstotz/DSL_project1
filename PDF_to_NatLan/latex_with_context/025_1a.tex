The task is labeled as "Aufgabe 1" and appears to relate to the reactor problem.  

A table is drawn with columns labeled \( P \), \( V \), \( T \), and \( h \). Two rows are visible, corresponding to two states:  
- In the \( T \) column, the temperatures are listed as \( 70^\circ\text{C} \) and \( 100^\circ\text{C} \).  
- The other columns (\( P \), \( V \), \( h \)) are left blank or have no visible values.  

Next to the table, the following text is written:  
"Grundstellung von T0 mit Flüssigkeit bei 70°C."  
This translates to: "Initial position of \( T_0 \) with liquid at \( 70^\circ\text{C} \)."  

Below this, a formula is partially visible:  
\[
Q = m \cdot (\text{h}_{\text{out}} - \text{h}_{\text{in}})
\]  
This appears to describe the heat transfer calculation based on mass and enthalpy difference.
