The diagram is a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) plot illustrating the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine. The key points are labeled as states \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The processes include:  
- **Isentropic compression** from \( 0 \) to \( 1 \).  
- **Isobaric heating** from \( 2 \) to \( 3 \).  
- **Isentropic expansion** from \( 3 \) to \( 4 \).  
- **Isobaric mixing** from \( 4 \) to \( 5 \).  
- **Isentropic expansion** from \( 5 \) to \( 6 \).  

The diagram also shows isobars (\( p_0 = p_6 \), \( p_2 = p_4 \), \( p_1 \)) and the entropy values (\( S \)) along the horizontal axis.  

Adiabatic-reversible processes are marked as isentropic.
