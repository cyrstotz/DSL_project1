The stationary energy balance is written as:  
\[
\dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{W}
\]  
\[
Q = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a) \quad \text{and} \quad t = -\dot{W}_K
\]  
\[
\dot{W}_K = 28 \quad V = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_g)
\]  

Definitions and assumptions:  
- \( h_e \): Enthalpy at state \( e \), where \( x_2 = ? \), and the substance is "ges√§ttigt gedampft" (saturated vapor).  
- \( h_a \): Enthalpy at state \( a \), where \( p = 3 \, \text{bar} \), and the process is "adiabatisch reversibel" (adiabatic and reversible).  
- \( s_2 = s_3 \): Entropy remains constant.  
- \( h_g = 93.62 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  
- \( h_i = h_e \), \( h_f = \) (value unclear).  

Additional notes:  
- \( T_K = -40^\circ\text{C} \).  
- \( T_f = -40^\circ\text{C} \).  

Some values and terms are crossed out or unclear, but the general energy balance and thermodynamic relationships are provided.
