The ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice}} \) is defined as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice}} = \frac{m_{\text{ice}}}{m_{\text{EW}}}
\]  
It is stated that \( x_{\text{ice}} > 0 \), which implies \( m_{\text{ice}} \neq 0 \).  

The equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture in state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},2} = T_{g,2} = T_{\text{GGW}}
\]  

The energy balance equation is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \sum_j Q_j - \sum_n W_{\text{in}}
\]
