The temperature and pressure values for different states are listed:  
\[
\begin{aligned}
T_2 &= -40^\circ\text{C}, \quad P_3 &= 8 \, \text{bar}, \quad T_3 &= -40^\circ\text{C}, \\
P_1 &= P_2, \quad P_2 &= P_1, \quad P_3 &= 8 \, \text{bar}, \quad P_4 &= 5 \, \text{bar}, \quad x_4 &= 0.
\end{aligned}
\]

The initial temperature \( T_i \) is given as \( -100^\circ\text{C} \), and the final temperature \( T_2 = T_3 = -40^\circ\text{C} \).  

The process between states 2 and 3 is described as "23 process."

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a \right] + Q_{23}^0 - \dot{W}_K
\]  
The mass flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_e - h_a}
\]  
The enthalpy at state \( e \) is given as:  
\[
h_e = h_g(-40^\circ\text{C}) = 244.9 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
The enthalpy at state \( a \) is not provided.
