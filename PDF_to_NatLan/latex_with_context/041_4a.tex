The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process.  
- The graph shows phase regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas).  
- The triple point (\(TP\)) is marked, and a horizontal line indicates the sublimation process below the triple point pressure.  
- The initial temperature (\(T_i\)) is marked above the sublimation temperature.  
- The graph qualitatively depicts the transitions between phases during the freeze-drying process.
