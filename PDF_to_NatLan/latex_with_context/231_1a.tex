Energy balance at the reactor wall:  
The inlet and outlet temperatures of the coolant are given as:  
\[
T_{\text{in}} = 288.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_{\text{out}} = 298.15 \, \text{K}.
\]  
The energy balance equation is expressed as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \left( h_e - h_a \right) = Q_{\text{out}} + Q_R,
\]  
where \( h(70^\circ\text{C}) - h(100^\circ\text{C}) \) represents the enthalpy difference.  

The change in internal energy is given by:  
\[
\Delta U = Q.
\]
