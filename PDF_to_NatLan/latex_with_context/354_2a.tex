The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram representing the jet engine process. It includes labeled isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_3 \), \( p_5 \), and \( p_6 \). The process starts at state \( 0 \), moves through states \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and ends at state \( 6 \). The curve shows the thermodynamic transitions, with arrows indicating the flow direction. The axes are labeled \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis.
