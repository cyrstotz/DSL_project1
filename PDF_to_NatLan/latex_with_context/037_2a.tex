The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis, and the specific entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process states:  
- State 0 represents the ambient conditions.  
- State 1 shows the inlet conditions.  
- State 2 represents the compression process.  
- State 3 corresponds to the combustion process.  
- State 4 represents the turbine process.  
- State 5 shows the mixing chamber conditions.  
- State 6 represents the nozzle exit conditions.  

The isobars are labeled as:  
- \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( p_0 = 0.797 \, \text{km} \)
