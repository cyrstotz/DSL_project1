The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) (temperature-entropy) plot representing the jet engine process. It includes labeled isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_5 \), and \( p_B \). The process begins at state \( 0 \), moves through compression to state \( 3 \), followed by isobaric combustion to state \( 4 \). The flow then undergoes expansion in the turbine to state \( 5 \), and mixing to state \( 6 \). Arrows indicate the direction of the process transitions.
