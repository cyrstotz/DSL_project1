Below the diagrams, a table is provided with columns labeled:  
- \(p\) (pressure),  
- \(T\) (temperature),  
- \(h\) (enthalpy),  
- \(\dot{Q}/\dot{W}\) (heat or work flow),  
- \(x\) (vapor quality),  
- Notes.  

The rows correspond to states \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), and \(4\):  
- **State 1**:  
  - \(\dot{Q}_K\) is listed under \(\dot{Q}/\dot{W}\).  

- **State 2**:  
  - \(W_K = 28 \, \text{W}\) is listed under \(\dot{Q}/\dot{W}\).  
  - Vapor quality \(x = 1\).  
  - Notes mention "adiabatic reversible."  

- **State 3**:  
  - Pressure \(p = 8 \, \text{bar}\).  

- **State 4**:  
  - Pressure \(p = 8 \, \text{bar}\).  
  - Vapor quality \(x = 0\).  

No additional numerical values or explanations are provided.

The required refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is calculated using the following energy balance for the compressor:  

\[
\dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{W}
\]

The steady-state flow process assumes negligible kinetic and potential energy changes (\( w_2^2 - w_3^2 = 0 \), \( z_2 - z_3 = 0 \)) and adiabatic operation. The energy equation simplifies to:  

\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{W}_K
\]

Rearranging for \( \dot{m} \):  

\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]
