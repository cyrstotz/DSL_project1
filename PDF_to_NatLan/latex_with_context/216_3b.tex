In state 2, the total heat capacity remains constant.  

The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
m_g \cdot c_p \cdot T_1 + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot c_p \cdot T_1 = m_g \cdot c_p \cdot T_2 + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot c_p \cdot T_2
\]  
Where:  
\[
c_p = R + c_v = 0.97 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  

The mass of the ice-water mixture is divided into ice and water:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} = m_{\text{Eis}} + m_{\text{Wasser}}, \quad m_{\text{Eis}} = 0.06 \, \text{kg}, \quad m_{\text{Wasser}} = 0.04 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The thermal mass of water is significantly higher than that of the gas. Therefore, the temperature difference is negligible.  

The pressure ratio is calculated as:  
\[
\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]  
Thus:  
\[
p_2 = p_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]
