The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated as follows:  

1. The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is given by:  
\[
\Delta U = \dot{m} \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = Q_{12}.
\]  
Potential energy changes are neglected.  

2. Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 3.418 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 0.633 \cdot 10^3 \cdot (0 - 500^\circ\text{C}) = -1,087.55 \, \text{kJ}.
\]  
Converting to joules:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1,087,554 \, \text{J}.
\]  

Thus, the heat transferred is:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1,087,554 \, \text{J}.
\]
