The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the force equilibrium:  
\[
F_c = F_p = F_{pa}
\]  
The equation for pressure is derived as:  
\[
p_s = m_K \cdot g + \rho_{\text{amb}} \cdot \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^2 \pi = \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^2 \pi \cdot p_{\text{amb}}
\]  
Substituting values, the gas pressure is determined to be:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_s = 1.40 \, \text{bar} \quad \text{(denoted as A)}  
\]  

The gas mass \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p V}{R T}  
\]  
The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{R}{M} = \frac{4157}{25} = 166.28  
\]  
Substituting values, the gas mass is determined to be:  
\[
m_g = 3.449 \, \text{g} \quad \text{(denoted as B)}  
\]
