The system is in thermodynamic equilibrium and isolated from the surroundings (no heat exchange). Therefore, the temperature \( T_{g,2} \) must equal \( T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \). Since the ambient pressure and piston pressure remain unchanged, the gas pressure in state 2 is:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.9 \, \text{bar}
\]
