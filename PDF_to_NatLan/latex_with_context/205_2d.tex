The equation for mass-specific exergy destruction is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_6 - h_0 - T_0 \cdot (s_6 - s_0)) + \Delta KE + \dot{Q}_B \cdot \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{\bar{T}_B}\right) - \dot{W}_{\text{comp}}
\]  
where \(\dot{Q}_B\) is the heat input during combustion, \(\bar{T}_B\) is the average temperature during combustion, and \(\dot{W}_{\text{comp}}\) is the work done by the compressor.

The final value for exergy destruction is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Exergy destruction} = 100 \, \text{kJ}
\]
