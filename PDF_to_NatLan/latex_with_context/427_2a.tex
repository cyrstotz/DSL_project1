A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled as \( T \, [K] \) (temperature in Kelvin) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( S \, [kJ/(kg \cdot K)] \) (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin). The graph appears to represent a qualitative \( T \)-\( S \) diagram, but no specific curves or points are plotted.
