The temperature of the gas in state 2 is:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K}
\]  

Since \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), the temperature of the EW in state 2 is \( 0^\circ \text{C} \), as it is at equilibrium (end state). Therefore, the temperature of the gas equals that of the EW, which is \( 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

The pressure remains constant:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{\text{EW},2} = p_{\text{oben}} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

As the mass above remains unchanged, the pressure must remain constant to maintain equilibrium, meaning the gas "supports" the mass in equilibrium.
