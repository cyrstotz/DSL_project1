A pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram is drawn, showing the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes the following features:  
- A curved line representing the phase boundary between liquid and vapor.  
- A straight diagonal line labeled "i" and "ii," indicating the two steps of the freeze-drying process.  
- The triple point is marked on the diagram.  
- The axes are labeled as \(p\) [bar] on the vertical axis and \(T\) [K] on the horizontal axis.
