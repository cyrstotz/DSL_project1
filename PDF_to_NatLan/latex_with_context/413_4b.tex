The refrigerant used is R134a.  
The pressures at states 3 and 4 are given as \( P_3 = P_4 = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  

The steady-state process in the compressor is described as adiabatic and reversible.  

**Entropy balance:**  
\[
\dot{m} (s_2 - s_3) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 0
\]  
Since the process is reversible and adiabatic, \( s_2 = s_3 \), and the terms \( \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} \) and \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) are zero.  

**Energy balance:**  
\[
\dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_k = 0
\]  
Rearranging for the mass flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

From Table A11:  
- \( h_{3,f} = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
- \( h_{3,g} = 264.15 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)
