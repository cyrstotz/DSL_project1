The refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h_{4} - h_{1}} = \frac{6.2455 \, \text{kW}}{93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}} \quad \text{(from Table A.11)}
\]  
The enthalpy values are referenced from Table A.11, and the process from state 4 to state 1 is described as isenthalpic, meaning \( h_4 = h_1 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).
