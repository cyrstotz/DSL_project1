The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is calculated using the heat transfer process:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \sum_j \frac{\dot{Q}_j}{T_j}
\]  
Further details are not clearly visible, but the calculation references entropy changes and heat transfer.  

Additional Notes:  
- A table labeled "Table A-2" provides thermodynamic properties for saturated liquid water at various temperatures.  
  - \( h_e(70^\circ\text{C}, x=0) = 297.28 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
  - \( s_e(70^\circ\text{C}, x=0) = 0.870 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)  
  - \( h_a(100^\circ\text{C}, x=0) = 419.04 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
  - \( s_a(100^\circ\text{C}, x=0) = 1.307 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)  

Descriptions of additional thermodynamic values for other temperatures are listed but crossed out or partially illegible.

The entropy production is calculated using the formula:  
\[
S_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\sum Q_j}{T_j}
\]  
Substituting the given values:  
\[
S_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T} = \frac{97.11 \, \text{kW}}{T}
\]  
(Note: The temperature \( T \) is not explicitly provided here.)
