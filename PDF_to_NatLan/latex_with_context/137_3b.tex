Since ice is still present, the equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture remains constant at \( T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The system is isobaric because the piston is free to move. Therefore:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.38397 \, \text{bar}.
\]  

The final state is thermodynamic equilibrium, meaning ice is still present, and all temperatures are \( 0^\circ\text{C} \):  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}.
\]
