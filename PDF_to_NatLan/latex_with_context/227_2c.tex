The equation for the mass-specific increase in flow exergy is written as:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot ex = \dot{m} \left[ h - h_0 - T_0 (s - s_0) + \frac{w^2}{2} \right]
\]  
where \( h \) is enthalpy, \( h_0 \) is reference enthalpy, \( T_0 \) is ambient temperature, \( s \) is entropy, \( s_0 \) is reference entropy, and \( w \) is velocity.  

The simplified expression for flow exergy is:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot ex = \dot{m} \left[ \ldots \right]
\]  
(The second term is partially crossed out and incomplete.)
