The vapor quality (\(x_4\)) at state 4 is calculated using the enthalpy relationship:  
\[
h_4 = h_f + x_4(h_g - h_f)
\]  

Given:  
\[
h_4 = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
x_4 = 0
\]  

The pressure at state 4 (\(p_4\)) is equal to \(p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar}\).  

The temperature at state 2 (\(T_2\)) is confirmed as:  
\[
T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C}
\]
