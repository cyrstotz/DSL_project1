A temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram is drawn. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin (\( \text{K} \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \).  

The diagram shows a qualitative process with four states labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), and \( 4 \).  
- State \( 1 \) to \( 2 \) is an isentropic process (vertical line).  
- State \( 2 \) to \( 3 \) is a curved line indicating an increase in entropy.  
- State \( 3 \) to \( 4 \) is another curved line with decreasing entropy.
