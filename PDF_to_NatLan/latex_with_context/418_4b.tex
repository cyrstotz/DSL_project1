From state 3 to state 4:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

From state 2 to state 3:  
\[
0 = -\dot{W}_K + \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3)
\]  

The enthalpy at state 3 is given as:  
\[
h_3 = 264.15 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The temperature at state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
T_2 = T_i - 6 \, \text{K}
\]
