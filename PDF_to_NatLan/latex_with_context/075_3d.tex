The ice fraction in state 2 is calculated. The temperature \( T_{g,2} = 0.0003^\circ\text{C} \).  

The energy balance for the ice-water mixture (EW) is written as:  
\[
\Delta U = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = Q
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q = -1.5 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The internal energy \( u_1 \) is calculated using:  
\[
u_1 = x_1 \cdot u_f + x_1 \cdot (u_f - u_i)
\]  
At \( x_1 = 0.6 \):  
\[
u_1 = -133.394 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated using:  
\[
u_2 = u_f + x_2 \cdot (u_f - u_i)
\]  
The ice fraction \( x_2 \) is determined using:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_f - u_i}
\]  
At \( x_2 = 0.4351 \):  
\[
x_2 = 0.4351
\]  

Finally, \( u_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q}{m} + u_1
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{-1.5}{0.01} + (-133.394) = -188.394 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
