The first diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram representing the jet engine process. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (K).  
- The horizontal axis is entropy \( s \) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \).  

Key points and processes are marked:  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are labeled, corresponding to different states in the jet engine.  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( s_2 = s_3 \), \( p_4 = p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), and \( s_5 = s_6 \).  
- The diagram includes isobars and curves representing compression, combustion, and expansion processes.  

The second diagram is another \( T \)-\( s \) diagram with more detailed isobaric lines and annotations:  
- The states 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are connected by polytropic and isentropic processes.  
- The axis labels remain the same as the first diagram.  
- The note "nicht nullpunkt" indicates that the entropy axis does not start at zero.
