The temperature of the gas in state 2 is equal to the equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},1} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  
Since the ice does not completely melt, the temperature of the ice-water mixture remains constant. Additionally, because the gas and the ice-water mixture are in thermal equilibrium, they share the same temperature.  

The gas pressure in state 2 remains constant:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.1 \, \text{bar}
\]  
This is because the external load on the membrane does not change (same mass and atmospheric pressure), so the gas pressure remains constant.
