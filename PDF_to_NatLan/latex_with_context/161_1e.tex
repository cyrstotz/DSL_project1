The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1
\]  
where \( m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12} \).  

The specific entropy values are:  
\[
s_1 = s_f(100^\circ\text{C}) = 1.306 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
\[
s_2 = s_f(20^\circ\text{C}) = 0.3545 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]
