The temperature of the ice-water mixture (\( T_{\text{EW}} \)) is:  
\[
T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  
The system remains in equilibrium at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), as the ice-water mixture is still in a two-phase state. The pressure in state 2 (\( p_{g,2} \)) is:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  
This is because at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), the equilibrium pressure of the ice-water mixture matches the calculated pressure.
