A graph is drawn showing the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled states: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The curve represents phase regions, with state 1 starting in the liquid-vapor region, state 2 in the vapor region, state 3 in the superheated vapor region, state 4 in the liquid region, and state 5 returning to the vapor region. The axes are labeled \( p \) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \( T \) (temperature) on the horizontal axis.
