The steady-state flow process (stat. FP) is described using the following equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{ex}_{\text{in}} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} - \dot{W} - \dot{ex}_{\text{out}}
\]  
This assumes an adiabatic turbine.  

The turbine work rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{W}_t = \dot{W}_{\text{turb}} - \dot{W}_{\text{comp}}
\]  
Expanding the turbine work term:  
\[
\dot{W}_{\text{turb}} = h_6 - h_5 + \frac{w_6^2 - w_5^2}{2} + q_B
\]  
The heat transfer term \( q_B \) is included in the calculation.
