The pressure remains the same as in state 1 because the system balances itself against the lower pressure above. The mass of the ice-water mixture remains constant.  

The system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, so:  
\[
T_2 = T_E(p_2) = 0^\circ\text{C} = T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}}
\]  
The temperature \( T_E(p_2) \) is taken from Table 1.  

No diagrams or additional figures are present.

Energy balance for the lower chamber system:  

\[
Q_{12} = \Delta E = \Delta U + \Delta pE + \Delta KE = Q_{12} - W_{v12}
\]

\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) - W_{v12}
\]

The change in internal energy is calculated as:  
\[
U_{2} - U_{1}^{\text{gas}} = c_V^{\text{gas}} \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot (500^\circ\text{C} - 0^\circ\text{C}) = 316.5 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

Substituting into the equation:  
\[
Q_{12} = 0.00342 \, \text{kg} \cdot 316.5 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} = 1.082 \, \text{kJ}
\]
