The heat flow removed by the coolant is given as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_R = \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 100 \, \text{kW}
\]  

Using the energy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_c - h_q \right) + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  

The enthalpy difference is expressed as:  
\[
h_c - h_q = \int_{T_q}^{T_c} c_{\text{if}} \, dT
\]
