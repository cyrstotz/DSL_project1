The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes labeled regions for "mass", "vapor", and "wet vapor" (or "mixed phase"). The curve represents the phase boundary between liquid and vapor. Key states are marked:  
- State 1: Located in the vapor region.  
- State 2: Transitioning into the wet vapor region.  
- State 3: Positioned in the wet vapor region.  
- State 4: Condensation occurs at the boundary between wet vapor and liquid.  
The horizontal axis is labeled as temperature (\( T \)) in degrees Celsius, and the vertical axis is labeled as pressure (\( p \)) in bar.
