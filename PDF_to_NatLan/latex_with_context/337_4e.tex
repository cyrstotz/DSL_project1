The heat transfer equation is given as:  
\[
Q = c \cdot m \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

It is noted that the temperature \( T_i \) would decrease, and phase change would occur. This implies that the cooling process would lead to a reduction in temperature and a transition between phases (e.g., solid to liquid or liquid to vapor).
