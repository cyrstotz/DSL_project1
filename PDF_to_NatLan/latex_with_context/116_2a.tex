The task involves drawing a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process.  

### Diagram Description:  
The diagram is a \( T \)-\( s \) plot with temperature (\( T \)) on the vertical axis (in Kelvin) and entropy (\( s \)) on the horizontal axis (in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kg·K} \)).  
- The process begins at state \( 0 \) (ambient conditions) and progresses through states \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \).  
- The curve labeled \( p_2 = p_1 \) represents an isobaric process.  
- State \( 0 \) is at ambient pressure (\( p_0 \)).  
- State \( 1 \) is connected to state \( 2 \) via an adiabatic compression process.  
- State \( 3 \) is at a higher temperature and entropy, representing combustion.  
- States \( 4 \) and \( 5 \) follow an adiabatic expansion process in the turbine.  
- State \( 6 \) is the nozzle exit, where the pressure equals \( p_0 \).  

### Table of States:  
A table is provided summarizing the states with pressure (\( p \)), temperature (\( T \)), entropy (\( s \)), and enthalpy (\( h \)):  
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{State (z)} & p \, [\text{bar}] & T \, [\text{K}] & s \, [\text{kJ}/\text{kg·K}] & h \, [\text{kJ}/\text{kg}] \\
\hline
1 & 0.5 & - & - & - \\
2 & - & - & s_2 = s_1 & - \\
3 & - & - & - & - \\
4 & 0.5 & - & - & - \\
5 & 0.5 & 431.9 & - & - \\
6 & 0.191 & 328.075 & s_6 = s_5 & - \\
0 & 0.191 & - & - & - \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Additional Notes:  
- The gas is modeled as ideal, and the process is assumed to be isentropic with \( \kappa = 1.4 \).  
- The temperature at state \( 6 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \cdot \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]
