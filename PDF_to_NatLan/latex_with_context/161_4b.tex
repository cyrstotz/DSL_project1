Another diagram is provided, showing a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph with labeled points and transitions:  
- The graph includes regions labeled "liquid" (\(fl√ºssig\)), "vapor" (\(dampf\)), and "solid" (\(fest\)).  
- Points 1, 2, and 3 are marked, with transitions between them.  
- Point 1 is in the liquid region, point 2 is in the vapor region, and point 3 is near the sublimation line.  
- The transitions are labeled "i" and "ii," corresponding to the freeze-drying process steps.
