The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) in state 2 are determined as follows:  

The gas and ice-water mixture reach equilibrium in state 2.  
- In state 1, the water is at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) with \( x_{\text{ice},1} > 0 \), meaning it is in a two-phase state.  
- From the table, at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), the equilibrium pressure \( p_{\text{EW}} \) is \( 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).  

In state 2:  
\[
p_{\text{EW}} = p_{\text{gas}} = p_{\text{atm}} + p_{\text{EW}}
\]  
Thus, \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \).
