The process from state 2 to state 3 is described as isentropic, meaning \( s_2 = s_3 \).  

A table is provided with the following columns:  
- \( \text{State} \): 1, 2, 3, 4  
- \( p \, (\text{bar}) \): 1, 1, 8, 8  
- \( T \): unspecified values  
- \( x \): 1 (state 2), 0 (state 4)  
- \( s \): \( s_2 = s_3 \)  
- \( h \): \( h_4 \)  

It is noted that \( x_3 \) is calculated.  

The enthalpy at state 1 is determined using the equation:  
\[
h_1 = h_f(36 \, \text{kPa}) = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
