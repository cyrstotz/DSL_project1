The equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture is given as:  
\[
T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} = T_{\text{EW},1} = T_{g,2}
\]  

The mass of the ice-water mixture is:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} = 0.1 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The initial ice fraction is:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.6
\]  

The heat transferred is:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1083.06 \, \text{J}
\]  

The final ice mass is calculated as:  
\[
m_{\text{ice},2} = 0.6 \cdot m_{\text{EW}} = 0.06 \, \text{kg}
\]
