The page begins with a graph labeled as a T-s diagram. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis, and entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis. The diagram illustrates the thermodynamic process of a jet engine, with labeled states and isobars.  

- State points \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \) and \( 6 \) are marked along the process path.  
- The isobars \( p_0, p_1, p_2 = p_3, p_4, \) and \( p_5 \) are shown as dashed lines.  
- The process path includes compression, combustion, and expansion stages, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
- The curve transitions from state \( 0 \) to \( 1 \), then to \( 2 \), followed by \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and finally \( 6 \).
