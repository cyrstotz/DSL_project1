The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis.  
- \( s \) (specific entropy, in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)) on the horizontal axis.  

The process is divided into the following stages:  
1. **Isentropic compression**: The curve from state 1 to state 2 is vertical, indicating constant entropy.  
2. **Isobaric heat addition**: The curve from state 2 to state 3 is horizontal, indicating constant pressure.  
3. **Adiabatic, irreversible turbine**: The curve from state 3 to state 4 slopes downward, indicating entropy increase.  
4. **Isobaric mixing chamber**: The curve from state 4 to state 5 is horizontal, indicating constant pressure.  
5. **Isentropic nozzle expansion**: The curve from state 5 to state 6 is vertical, indicating constant entropy.  

Dashed lines labeled "Dome" indicate phase boundaries.

The equation for entropy change is given as:  
\[
S_6 - S_0 = S^\circ_6 - S^\circ_0 - R \ln \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)
\]  

The gas constant \( R \) is defined as:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_{\text{Luft}}}
\]  

Using interpolation, the value of \( S^\circ_0 \) is calculated as:  
\[
S^\circ_0 = \frac{1.54191 - 1.47824}{250 - 240} \cdot (243.75 - 240) + 1.47824
\]  
This results in:  
\[
S^\circ_0 = 1.49118249 \approx 1.49113
\]
