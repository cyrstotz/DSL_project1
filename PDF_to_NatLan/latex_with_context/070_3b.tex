Since the given conditions do not change, the piston still exerts a mass of \( 32 \, \text{kg} \) and 1 bar atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the gas pressure in state 2 remains the same:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.247 \, \text{bar}
\]

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = 0 = m_{\text{EW}} (u_{2g} - u_{1g}) + m_g (u_2 - u_1)
\]  
Substituting for internal energy changes:  
\[
\Delta E = m_{\text{EW}} (u_{2g} - u_{1g}) + m_g \cdot c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]
