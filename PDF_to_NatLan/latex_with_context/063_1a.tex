The solution begins with an energy balance for the cooling jacket (KF):  

\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{KF}} \left[ h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}} \right] + Q_{\text{out}}
\]  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is expressed as:  

\[
Q_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_{\text{KF}} \left[ h_{\text{out}} - h_{\text{in}} \right]
\]  

The heat transfer through the reactor wall to the coolant is given by:  

\[
Q_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_{\text{KF}} c \left( T_{\text{out}} - T_{\text{in}} \right)
\]  

Rewriting the energy balance:  

\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \left[ h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}} \right] + Q_R - Q_{\text{out}}
\]  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is calculated as:  

\[
Q_{\text{out}} = m_{\text{in}} \left[ h_{\text{e}} - h_{\text{out}} \right] + Q_R
\]  

The enthalpy values are determined from water tables:  

\[
h_{\text{out}} = h_f(100^\circ\text{C}) = 419.04 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

\[
h_{\text{in}} = h_f(70^\circ\text{C}) + x \cdot \left( h_g(70^\circ\text{C}) - h_f(70^\circ\text{C}) \right)
\]
