The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is calculated using the integral relationship:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int T \, \text{d}s}{s_a - s_e} = \frac{\Delta h - v \Delta p}{s_a - s_e}.
\]  

Substituting for \( h_2 - h_1 \) and simplifying:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\Delta T_2 - T_1}{\Delta \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)} = 283.1216 \, \text{K}.
\]
