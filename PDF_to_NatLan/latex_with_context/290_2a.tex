A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( s \, [\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}] \), and the y-axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \). The diagram includes several curves and points:  
- Points \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \) are marked.  
- The curves represent isobars, with labels \( p_0 \), \( p_5 = p_4 \), \( p_3 = p_7 \), and \( p_2 = p_3 \).  
- The process lines are drawn in magenta, connecting the points in sequence.  
- A note on the right states: "Blau Kurve nicht beachten!" ("Do not consider the blue curve!")
