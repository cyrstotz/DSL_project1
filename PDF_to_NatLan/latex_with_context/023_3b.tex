The task involves determining \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \).  

The gas pressure in state 2 is given as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 1.5 \, \text{bar}
\]  

It is stated that \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \), and the mass remains constant.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
T_{g,2} = \frac{p_{g,2} V_{g,1}}{m R}
\]
