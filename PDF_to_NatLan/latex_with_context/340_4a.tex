A graph is drawn with axes labeled \( p \) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \( T \) (temperature) on the horizontal axis. Two distinct regions are marked:  
- Region labeled "i)" with a horizontal line indicating isobaric evaporation.  
- Region labeled "ii)" with a vertical line indicating sublimation.
