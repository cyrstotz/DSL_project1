The exergy destruction rate is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\dot{ex}_{\text{dest}} = T_0 \frac{\dot{S}_{\text{gen}}}{\dot{m}}
\]  

The entropy generation rate is given by:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = s_6 - s_0 + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T_0}
\]  

Here, the heat transfer term is neglected, leading to:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = s_6 - s_0 = 0.157867 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  

Thus, the exergy destruction rate is:  
\[
\dot{ex}_{\text{dest}} = 1 + (0.1704) \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
