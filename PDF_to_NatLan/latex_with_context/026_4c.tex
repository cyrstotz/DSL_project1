At \( T = -22^\circ\text{C} \), the pressure \( p_2 = 1.2192 \, \text{bar} \), which equals \( p_1 \), as the process is isobaric.  

The enthalpy \( h_2 \) is calculated using:  
\[
h_2 = h_g \text{ at } -22^\circ\text{C} - T \cdot A \cdot c
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
h_2 = 234.08 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
