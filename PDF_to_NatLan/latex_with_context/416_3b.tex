The temperature of the gas in state 2 is equal to the temperature of the ice-water mixture:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0.0^\circ\text{C}
\]  
The pressure of the gas in state 2 remains the same as in state 1:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]  
Explanation:  
- The external pressure remains constant, as in state 1.  
- Since ice is still present in the water, all heat is used for melting the ice.  
- At equilibrium, the temperature does not change further, and the ice fraction remains constant.
