The heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta U_{g} = Q_{12} = -1082.23 \, \text{kJ}
\]

The change in internal energy is:  
\[
\Delta u = u(T_2) - u(T_1) = c_V (T_2 - T_1) = -31.496 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The final temperature of the gas is:  
\[
T_2 = 0.003^\circ \text{C}
\]
