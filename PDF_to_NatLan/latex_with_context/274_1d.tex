The energy balance equation for determining \( \Delta m_{12} \) is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a \right] + \sum \dot{Q} + \sum \dot{m}_i h_i
\]  
From this, the equation is simplified to:  
\[
m_{2} u_{2} - m_{1} u_{1} = Q_{R,12} + \Delta m_{12} h_{12}
\]  
Rearranging to solve for \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
m_{R} \left( u_{2} - u_{1} \right) - Q_{R,12} = \Delta m_{12} h_{12}
\]  

Using the given data:  
- From Table A2:  
  - \( T_{1} = T_{R} = 100^\circ\text{C} \)  
  - \( T_{2} = T_{R} = 70^\circ\text{C} \)  
- \( T_{\text{in,12}} = 20^\circ\text{C} \)  

The values for \( u_{2} \) and \( u_{1} \) are:  
\[
u_{2} = 418.94 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad u_{1} = 252.95 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The enthalpy \( h_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
h_{12} = 83.96 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Finally, the mass change \( \Delta m_{12} \) is determined as:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = -5052.79 \, \text{g}
\]  
This result is noted as "nicht m√∂glich" (not possible).
