A graph is drawn showing a qualitative process in a \( T \)-\( S \) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled \( T [K] \), representing temperature, and the horizontal axis is labeled \( S [\frac{\text{J}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}] \), representing entropy. Several isobars are depicted, labeled as \( P_2 = P_3 \), \( P_1 = P_5 = P_4 \), and \( P_0 \). The states are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with arrows indicating the transitions between states.
