A graph is drawn showing pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis (labeled in bar) and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis (labeled in Kelvin). The graph depicts a typical phase diagram with a dome-shaped curve. Points 1, 2, and 3 are marked on the diagram, with arrows indicating transitions between states.
