A schematic diagram is drawn representing the refrigeration cycle using R134a. The diagram includes arrows indicating the flow of refrigerant (\( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \)) through components such as a compressor and an expansion valve. The refrigerant enters and exits these components, with the flow direction clearly marked. Labels include:  
- \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) (mass flow rate of R134a).  
- Arrows showing the refrigerant entering and exiting the components.
