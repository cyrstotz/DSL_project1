A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( S \) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as entropy \( S \, \left[\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}\right] \), and the y-axis is labeled as temperature \( T \, [\text{K}] \). The diagram shows several states labeled as 2, 4, 5, and 6.  
- State 2 is at the lower left of the curve.  
- State 4 is at the peak of the curve.  
- State 5 is on the descending part of the curve, and a vertical line connects state 5 to state 6, which is further to the right.  
The curve resembles a typical thermodynamic process with isobars and transitions between states.
