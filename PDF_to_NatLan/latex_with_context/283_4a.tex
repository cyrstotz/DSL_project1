The graph depicts a pressure-temperature (\(P\)-\(T\)) diagram. The pressure axis is labeled in bar (\([ \text{bar} ]\)), and the temperature axis is labeled in Kelvin (\([ \text{K} ]\)). The curve represents the phase boundary between different states of the refrigerant. The peak of the curve is marked, indicating the critical point. The diagram shows the general shape of a phase diagram with a rising and falling curve.
