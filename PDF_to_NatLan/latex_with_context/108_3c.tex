The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
m_g (u_2 - u_1) + m_{\text{EW}} (u_{\text{EW},2} - u_{\text{EW},1}) = 0
\]  

The change in internal energy for the gas is:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

Substituting into the energy balance:  
\[
m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1) = m_{\text{EW}} \Delta u_{\text{EW}}
\]  

Where \( \Delta u_{\text{EW}} \) represents the change in internal energy of the ice-water mixture.  

This equation can be used to calculate the heat transferred \( Q_{12} \).

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
E\text{-Bal: } \Delta U_{12} = Q_{12}
\]  
The change in internal energy is calculated using the specific heat capacity:  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = m_g c_{V,g} (T_2 - T_1) = -708.65 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
The heat transferred is:  
\[
Q_{12} = \Delta U_{12} = -708.65 \, \text{kJ}
\]
