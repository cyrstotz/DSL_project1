A temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(s\)) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and isentropes. The states are marked as follows:  
- State 0 is the ambient condition.  
- State 1 is the inlet to the compressor.  
- State 2 is the outlet of the compressor.  
- State 3 is the combustion chamber outlet.  
- State 4 is the turbine outlet.  
- State 5 is the mixing chamber outlet.  
- State 6 is the nozzle exit.  

The isentropic processes are shown as vertical lines, while the isobaric processes are depicted as horizontal curves.
