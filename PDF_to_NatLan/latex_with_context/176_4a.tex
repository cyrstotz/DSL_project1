The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph. The vertical axis represents pressure in bar, and the horizontal axis represents temperature in degrees Celsius (\(^\circ\text{C}\)). The graph shows phase regions, including a line labeled "flowing" and another labeled "fast." The phase change boundaries are indicated, and the graph includes arrows pointing toward specific regions.
