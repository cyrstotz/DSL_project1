The thermodynamic mean temperature \(T_{\text{KF}}\) is calculated using the entropy integral:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_{S_a}^{S_e} T \, ds}{S_e - S_a}
\]  

Values for entropy are provided:  
- \(S_e = 288.15 \, \text{K}\)  
- \(S_a = 258.15 \, \text{K}\)  

The entropy difference is calculated as:  
\[
S_e - S_a = 1.306 \, \text{kgÂ·K}
\]  

The thermodynamic mean temperature is determined using the integral and entropy values.
