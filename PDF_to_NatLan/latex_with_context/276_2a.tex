The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and isentropic processes:  
- The curve starts at \( P_0 \), representing the ambient pressure.  
- The process moves isentropically to \( P_2 \), indicating compression.  
- From \( P_2 \), an isobaric process leads to \( P_3 \), representing combustion.  
- The process then moves isentropically to \( P_4 \), indicating expansion in the turbine.  
- Finally, an isobaric process leads to \( P_5 \), with \( P = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), and reverses isentropically to \( P_6 \), returning to ambient pressure \( P_0 \).  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) [K] on the vertical axis (temperature).  
- \( S \) [kJ/kgÂ·K] on the horizontal axis (entropy).
