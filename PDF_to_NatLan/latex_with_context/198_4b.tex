The energy balance for the compressor is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}_K  
\]  
Since the process is adiabatic, \( \dot{Q} = 0 \), simplifying the equation to:  
\[
\dot{W}_K = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_2 - h_3)  
\]  

The enthalpy \( h_2 \) is determined from the refrigerant properties at \( T_2 \):  
\[
h_2 = h_{\text{g}}(T_2)  
\]  

The temperature \( T_2 \) is given as:  
\[
T_2 = T_i - 6 \, \text{K}  
\]  

Using the conditions from Step ii, \( T_i \) can be determined from the \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The value of \( T_i \) is calculated as:  
\[
T_i = 10^\circ\text{C} = 283.15 \, \text{K}  
\]
