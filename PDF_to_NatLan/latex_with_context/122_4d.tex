The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}(h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_u
\]

The heat transfer rate is given by:  
\[
\dot{Q}_u = \dot{m}(h_a - h_e)
\]

From the table (Tab A-10) at \( T = -76^\circ \text{C} \), the enthalpy of the refrigerant in gaseous form is:  
\[
h_a = 237.14 \, \frac{\text{W}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The work rate is:  
\[
\dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{W}
\]
