The process is represented qualitatively in a \( T \)-\( S \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars and states:  
- State \( 0 \) corresponds to ambient conditions (\( p_0 \)).  
- States \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \) are shown along the process path.  
- The diagram includes dashed lines for isentropic processes and solid lines for other transitions.  
- The axes are labeled: \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( S \) (specific entropy, \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)) on the horizontal axis.
