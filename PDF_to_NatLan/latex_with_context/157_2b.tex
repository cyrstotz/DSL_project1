The following equations and calculations are provided:  
1. The mass flow rate equation:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{gas}} = \rho \cdot A \cdot w
\]  
where \( \rho = \frac{1}{v} \) (density is the inverse of specific volume).  

2. Energy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \left( \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2} \right) - W_t
\]  
where \( W_t = \psi \int_{p_1}^{p_2} v \, dp \).  

3. Known values:  
\[
w_6 = 220 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\]  
\[
w_a = w_6 = 500 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\]  
\[
T_6 = 340 \, \text{K}
\]  

No further explanation or calculations are provided beyond these equations and values.
