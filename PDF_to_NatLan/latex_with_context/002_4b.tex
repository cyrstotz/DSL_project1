The entropy at state \( 2 \) is equal to the entropy at state \( 3 \):  
\[
s_2 = s_3
\]  
The pressure at state \( 3 \) is given as \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \), and the vapor quality at state \( 2 \) is \( x_2 = 1 \). At state \( 4 \), the vapor quality is \( x_4 = 0 \), and the pressure is \( p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  

Energy balance for the cooler:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_1 - h_2 \right] + Q - \dot{W}^o
\]  

The entropy at state \( 2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
s_2 = s_3 - s_3(8 \, \text{bar}) = 9.966 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

At state \( 4 \), the enthalpy is determined:  
\[
h_4 = h_4(8 \, \text{bar}, x = 0) = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Adiabatic throttling process:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \sum \left[ h_4 - h_1 \right]
\]  
Here, \( h_4 = h_1 \).  

Energy balance for the compressor:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] + \dot{W}^o - W
\]  

The work done by the compressor is expressed as:  
\[
W = m \dot{p}
\]
