A graph is drawn showing the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The axes are labeled as \( p \, [\text{bar}] \) for pressure and \( T \, [\text{K}] \) for temperature. The graph includes three labeled states (1, 2, and 3) and a curve representing the phase boundary.  
- State 1 is in the liquid region.  
- State 2 is near the phase boundary, indicating evaporation.  
- State 3 is in the vapor region.  
Arrows indicate transitions between states, and the process is labeled as "isobaric" and "reversible adiabatic."
