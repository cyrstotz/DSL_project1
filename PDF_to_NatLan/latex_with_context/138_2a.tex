The page begins with a graph labeled \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (specific entropy) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts three distinct states connected by lines:  
1. The first state (\( s_1 \)) is at the lowest entropy and temperature.  
2. The second state (\( s_2 \)) is at a higher entropy and temperature, connected to \( s_1 \) by a steep upward curve.  
3. The third state (\( s_3 \)) is at an even higher entropy but the same temperature as \( s_2 \), connected by a horizontal line.  

The graph is annotated with the following descriptions:  
1. "adiabatic, reversible \( \Rightarrow s_1 = s_2 \)"  
2. "isobar, isothermal \( \Rightarrow s_2 \rightarrow s_3 \)"  
3. "T_0 \rightarrow T_2"
