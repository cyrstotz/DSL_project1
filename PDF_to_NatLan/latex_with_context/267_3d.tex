An energy balance for the ice-water system (closed, isobaric, isochoric) is applied:  
\[
\Delta U_{\text{EW}} = Q_{12}
\]  
The internal energy at state 2 is calculated:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}} + u_1
\]  
where \( u_1 = -789.97 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

The ice fraction at state 2 is determined using the equation:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_{\text{water}}}{u_{\text{ice}} - u_{\text{water}}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_2 = 0.5548 \approx 0.555
\]  

The temperature of the ice-water mixture remains constant:  
\[
T = 0.01^\circ\text{C}
\]
