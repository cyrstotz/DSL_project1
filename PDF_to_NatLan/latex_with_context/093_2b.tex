The energy balance equation for the jet engine is written as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} + p_5 v_5 - p_6 v_6 + q
\]  
where \( h_5 \) and \( h_6 \) are specific enthalpies at states 5 and 6, \( w_5 \) and \( w_6 \) are velocities, \( p_5 \) and \( p_6 \) are pressures, \( v_5 \) and \( v_6 \) are specific volumes, and \( q \) is heat transfer.  

The enthalpy difference \( h_5 - h_6 \) is expressed as:  
\[
h_5 - h_6 = \int_{T_6}^{T_5} c_p \, dT - c_p \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right) + R \left( T_5 - T_6 \right)
\]  

The velocity at the nozzle exit \( w_{\text{nozzle}} \) is calculated using:  
\[
w_{\text{nozzle}} = \sqrt{\frac{2R(T_5 - T_6)}{\kappa - 1}}
\]  

Constants and relationships are defined:  
\[
R = c_p - c_v, \quad \kappa = \frac{c_p}{c_v}, \quad R = c_p \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\kappa} \right)
\]  

Numerical values are provided:  
\[
R = 0.287 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}, \quad c_p = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}, \quad \kappa = 1.4
\]  

For the isentropic relation:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} = 526.634 \, \text{K}
\]
