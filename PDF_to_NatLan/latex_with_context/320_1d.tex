The temperature of the reactor contents at state 2 is given as \( T_{\text{Reactor},2} = 70^\circ\text{C} = 343.15 \, \text{K} \).  

The mass change \( \Delta m_{12} \) is to be determined, with the inlet temperature \( T_{\text{in}} = 20^\circ\text{C} \).  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} u_{\text{in}} + Q_{R,12}
\]  

Rearranging for \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{(m_1 + \Delta m_{12}) u_2 - m_1 u_1}{Q_{R,12}}
\]  

Expanding further:  
\[
Q_{R,12} \Delta m_{12} = (m_1 + \Delta m_{12}) u_2 - m_1 u_1
\]  

Rewriting:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} (Q_{R,12} - u_2) = m_2 u_1 - m_1 u_2
\]  

Finally:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_1 (u_2 - u_1)}{Q_{R,12} - u_2}
\]
