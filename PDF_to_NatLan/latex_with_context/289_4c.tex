The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h}
\]  
The temperature at state 2 is \( T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C} \), and the vapor quality \( x_2 \) is to be determined.  

For isenthalpic expansion:  
\[
h_2 = h_1
\]  
From the refrigerant data:  
\[
h_q(8 \, \text{bar}) - h_g(8 \, \text{bar}) = 264.77 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
