The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(h) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}^o
\]  
Simplified to:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(h) + \dot{Q} - W
\]  
The work \(W\) is expressed as:  
\[
W = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_3)
\]  
The mass flow rate \(\dot{m}\) is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{W}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
The enthalpy \(h_2\) is defined as:  
\[
h_2 = h_g(T = T_z)
\]  
For an isentropic process, the entropy at State 3 equals the entropy at State 2:  
\[
s_3 = s_2
\]  
The temperature \(T_z\) is calculated using the isentropic relation:  
\[
\frac{p_3}{p_2} = \left(\frac{T_3}{T_2}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_z = T_2 \left(\frac{p_2}{p_3}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]
