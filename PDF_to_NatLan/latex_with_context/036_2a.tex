The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and process paths:  
- Points 1 to 2 represent an isentropic compression.  
- Points 2 to 3 represent heat addition at constant pressure (isobaric combustion).  
- Points 3 to 4 represent an isentropic expansion through the turbine.  
- Points 4 to 5 represent mixing at constant pressure.  
- Points 5 to 6 represent an isentropic expansion through the nozzle.  
The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (entropy), with entropy measured in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).
