The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process.  
- The graph shows phase regions labeled as "liquid," "vapor," and "solid."  
- A curved line separates the liquid and vapor regions, representing the saturation curve.  
- The process steps are marked as "i" and "ii," with arrows indicating transitions.  
- Step "i" begins in the vapor region and moves toward the liquid region.  
- Step "ii" transitions from the liquid region toward the solid region.  
- The triple point is labeled, and the sublimation line is shown extending from the triple point into the solid-vapor region.
