The task involves calculating exergy for a stationary flow process. The following equations and values are provided:

The general exergy equation for a stationary flow process is written as:  
\[
0 = -\Delta \dot{E}_{\text{kin}} + \sum \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W} - \dot{E}_{\text{in,ex}}
\]

The specific exergy equation is expressed as:  
\[
e_{\text{ex,out}} = -\Delta e_{\text{ex,kin}} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) \dot{q}
\]

The final calculated exergy value is:  
\[
e_{\text{ex,out}} = 847.38 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

Additional values provided:  
\[
q = 1195 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
T_0 = 293.15 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
\bar{T}_B = 1289 \, \text{K}
\]
