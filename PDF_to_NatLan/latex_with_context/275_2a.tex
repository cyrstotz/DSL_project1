The ambient temperature is given as \( T_0 = 263.15 \, \text{K} \), and the ambient pressure is \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \). The mass flow ratio is \( \dot{m}_M / \dot{m}_K = 5.293 \). The specific heat capacity of air is \( c_p = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \), and the adiabatic index is \( \kappa = 1.4 \).

Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. **T-s Diagram**:  
   - The diagram shows temperature \( T \) (in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and entropy \( s \) (in \( \text{kJ/kg·K} \)) on the horizontal axis.  
   - States 1 through 6 are labeled, with arrows indicating transitions between states.  
   - Isobars are drawn, representing constant pressure lines. The ambient pressure \( p_0 \) and another pressure \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) are marked.  
   - The process includes compression (state 1 to state 3), combustion (state 3 to state 4), turbine expansion (state 4 to state 5), and mixing (state 5 to state 6).  

2. **Zoomed T-s Diagram**:  
   - A more detailed view of the same process, emphasizing the transitions between states 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
   - The isobar at \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) is highlighted.
