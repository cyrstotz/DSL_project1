The first law of thermodynamics is applied to water in steady-state conditions, assuming \( \dot{m} = \text{constant} \).  

\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} - \dot{W}
\]

The heat flow removed by the coolant is expressed as:  

\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_R
\]

Values for enthalpy are given:  
\[
h_e = 292.985 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad h_a = 419.094 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The calculated heat flow is:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 62.182 \, \text{kW}
\]
