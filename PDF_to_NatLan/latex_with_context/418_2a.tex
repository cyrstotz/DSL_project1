The process is represented in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram shows the thermodynamic process of a jet engine, with labeled isobars and isentropic curves. Key points are marked as states \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), and \( 5 \). The ambient pressure \( p_0 \) is indicated, and the process transitions include compression, combustion, and expansion. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin) and \( s \) (specific entropy in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)).
