The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) of the gas in state 1 are calculated as follows:  

The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the cylinder is determined using the formula:  
\[
A = (5 \times 10^{-2})^2 \pi = 7.854 \, \text{m}^2 \times 10^{-3}
\]  

The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated as:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1 \, \text{bar} + \frac{32 \, \text{kg}}{A} + 0.1 \, \text{bar} = 1.041 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The ideal gas law is used to calculate the mass \( m_g \):  
\[
pV = mRT
\]  
where \( R = \frac{8.314}{50} \).  

Substituting values:  
\[
m = \frac{1.041 \times 3.141 \times 10^{-3}}{\frac{8.314}{50} \times 773.15} = 2.5426 \, \text{kg}
\]
