The goal is to determine \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \).  

The pressure in state 2 is equal to the pressure in state 1:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}, \text{ since the weight of the EW does not change.}
\]  

The gas equation is used again:  
\[
p_{g,2} V_{g,2} = m_g R T_{g,2}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
p_{g,2} V_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \cdot 3.14 \, \text{L}
\]  
\[
m_g R = 3.42 \, \text{g} \cdot 0.1663 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

The result is simplified to:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 7
\]
