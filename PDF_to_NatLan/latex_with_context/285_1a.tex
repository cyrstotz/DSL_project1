The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a) + Q_{\text{out}}
\]  
The heat flow removed by the coolant is expressed as:  
\[
Q_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a)
\]  
The enthalpy difference is calculated using:  
\[
h_e - h_a = c_v (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
The specific enthalpy at \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \) is given as:  
\[
h_3(T = 70^\circ\text{C}) = 2626.9 \, \text{J/g}
\]  

Additional parameters provided:  
\[
\dot{m} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s}
\]  
\[
T_{\text{in}} = 343.15 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
T_{\text{out}} = 373.15 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
m_{\text{total}} = 5755 \, \text{kg}
\]  
Coolant temperatures:  
\[
T_{\text{KF,in}} = 288.15 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
T_{\text{KF,out}} = 298.15 \, \text{K}
