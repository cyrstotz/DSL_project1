The task involves an energy balance related to specific flow properties (SFP).  

The equation for \( Q \) is given as:  
\[
Q = \Delta ex_{\text{thr}} + ex_{\text{Q}} - ex_{\text{red}}
\]  

The specific exergy of the flow is expressed as:  
\[
ex_{\text{vol}} = p ex_{\text{thr}} + ex_{\text{Q}}
\]  

A detailed expression for \( ex_{\text{Q}} \) is derived as:  
\[
\frac{1}{n} \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) Q
\]  

This simplifies further to:  
\[
\left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_B} \right) q_B
\]  

Finally, the specific exergy of the flow is written as:  
\[
ex_{\text{vol}} = \Delta ex_{\text{thr}} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_B} \right) q_B
\]
