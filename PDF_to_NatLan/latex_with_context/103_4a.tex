The table outlines the states of the refrigeration cycle with the following parameters:  
- \( p \): Pressure in bar  
- \( T \): Temperature  
- \( x \): Vapor quality  

The states are described as follows:  
1. \( p = 1 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = T_1 \), \( x = 1 \) (isobaric process)  
2. \( p = p_1 \), \( T = T_1 \), \( x = 1 \) (isentropic process)  
3. \( p = 8 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = T_3 \), \( x = 0 \) (isobaric process)  
4. \( p = 8 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = T_4 \), \( x = 0 \) (isentropic process)  

The processes are labeled as isobaric and isentropic transitions.
