a) A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process states:  
- State 0: Ambient conditions (\( p_0, T_0 \))  
- State 2: Compression  
- State 3: Combustion  
- State 5: Mixing chamber (\( p_5, T_5 \))  
- State 6: Nozzle exit (\( p_6 = p_0 \))  

The diagram shows increasing entropy during combustion and decreasing entropy during compression and expansion. Axes are labeled as \( T \, [\text{K}] \) and \( s \, [\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}] \).
