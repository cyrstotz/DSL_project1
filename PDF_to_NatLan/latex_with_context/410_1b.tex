**Thermodynamic Mean Temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \):**  
The mean temperature is calculated using:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_{S_a}^{S_e} T \, dS}{S_a - S_e}
\]  
For an ideal liquid, entropy change \( S_a - S_e \) is determined by integrating:  
\[
S_a - S_e = \int_{T_{\text{KF,in}}}^{T_{\text{KF,out}}} \frac{c_p(T)}{T} \, dT
\]  
Assuming constant pressure and adiabatic conditions, the mean temperature is approximated as:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{T_{\text{KF,in}} + T_{\text{KF,out}}}{2}
\]  
Substituting the inlet and outlet temperatures:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{288.15 \, \text{K} + 298.15 \, \text{K}}{2} = 293.15 \, \text{K}
\]
