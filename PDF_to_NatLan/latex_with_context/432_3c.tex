The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the EW is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
Q = \Delta E = \Delta U = Q_{12} - W_{v,12}
\]  

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U_g \) is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U_g = m_g c_v (T_2 - T_1) + W_{v,12} = Q_{12}
\]  

The work term \( W_{v,12} \) is left incomplete.
