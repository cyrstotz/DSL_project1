A graph is drawn showing pressure \( p \) (in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in \( ^\circ \text{C} \)) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts the phase regions of a substance, including the triple point labeled "Tripel."  
- The pressure axis ranges from 1 mbar to 1 bar.  
- The temperature axis includes a marked point \( T_i \), and the curve peaks at the triple point.  
- Two states are labeled: state \( 1 \) at higher pressure and state \( 2 \) at lower pressure.
