Two diagrams are drawn to represent the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram.  

1. The first diagram shows phase regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "gas." The lines separating these regions represent phase boundaries. The triple point is marked, and the sublimation line is highlighted. The diagram includes arrows indicating transitions between states.  

2. The second diagram zooms into the sublimation process, showing the transition from solid to gas. The labels indicate "fast," "slow," and "missing" sublimation rates.
