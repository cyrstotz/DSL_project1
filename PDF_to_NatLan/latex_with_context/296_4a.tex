The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(P\)-\(T\)) graph. It shows the freeze-drying process with labeled regions and transitions.  
- The curve represents the phase boundary.  
- Point 1 is labeled as "HÃ¶her" (higher) and is connected to point 2 by an isothermal line.  
- Point 2 is labeled "Tripel" (triple point), indicating the triple point of water.  
- The process transitions from point 1 to point 2 along an isothermal path.
