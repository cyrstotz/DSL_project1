A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process paths:  
- \( p_0 = p_6 \) (ambient pressure)  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \) (high pressure)  
- Adiabatic and isentropic processes are marked.  
- States 1 through 6 are labeled along the process paths.  
The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (entropy).
