The entropy production is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = u_6 - u_0 - T_0(s_6 - s_0) + p_0(v_6 - v_0)
\]  
Substituting the specific enthalpy and entropy terms:  
\[
u_6 - u_0 = c_p(T_6 - T_0) - T_0 \ln \left(\frac{T_6}{T_0}\right)
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = c_p(T_6 - T_0) - T_0 \cdot c_p \ln \left(\frac{T_6}{T_0}\right) + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2}
\]  
Numerical evaluation yields:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = -11.0723 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot \left( h_a - h_e + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} \right) + q^2 + w
\]  
where \( h_a \) and \( h_e \) are enthalpies, \( w_a \) and \( w_e \) are velocities, \( q^2 \) represents heat transfer, and \( w \) represents work.  

The entropy production equation is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot w^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot v \cdot dp + dq + q^2
\]
