The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. It includes labeled points corresponding to states \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The process involves isobars and curves indicating compression, combustion, and expansion.  
- The curve starts at state \( 0 \) and rises sharply to state \( 2 \), representing compression.  
- From state \( 2 \) to \( 3 \), there is a further increase in temperature and entropy, indicating combustion.  
- The curve then drops from state \( 3 \) to \( 4 \), representing turbine expansion.  
- States \( 5 \) and \( 6 \) are connected by a steep curve, indicating the nozzle process.  
The isobars are marked, and the general flow of the process is shown with arrows.
