The temperature of the gas and the ice-water mixture (EW) is equal in state 2 because \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), meaning there is still ice present. Therefore, \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \).

The pressure of the gas in state 2 is approximately \( p_{g,2} = 740 - 744 \, \text{Pa} \approx 744 \, \text{Pa} \), as the forces from inside and outside the system are equal. This corresponds to an isobaric expansion.
