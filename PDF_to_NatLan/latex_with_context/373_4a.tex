A graph is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The curve represents the phase boundaries, with labeled points 1, 2, 3, and 4 indicating different states in the freeze-drying process. Arrows indicate the transitions between these states, forming a cycle. The axes are labeled as \( p \) [bar] for pressure and \( T \) [K] for temperature.
