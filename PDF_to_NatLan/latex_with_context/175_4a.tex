The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph. It shows the phase regions with a curve labeled "Trippel" (triple point). The graph includes two processes:  
- An isothermal process labeled "isotherm."  
- An isobaric process labeled "isobar."  
The states 1 and 2 are marked along the curve, indicating transitions between phases.
