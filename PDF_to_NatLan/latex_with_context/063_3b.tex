The pressure is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p = \frac{m \cdot R \cdot T}{V_2}
\]  

The temperature at equilibrium is:  
\[
T_a = T_{\text{equilibrium}} = 0^\circ \, \text{C}
\]  

The pressure remains constant:  
\[
p_2 = p_1 = 1.84 \, \text{bar}, \text{ as } p \text{ is always evenly distributed and constant.
\]
