The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are discussed. It is noted that the mass on the piston does not change, and the volume of the ice-water mixture (EW) remains constant. The gas compresses, resulting in higher pressure but a lower temperature.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is calculated as:  
\[
T_{g,2} = \frac{p_{g,2} V_{g,2}}{m_g R}
\]  

The relationship between pressure and volume is described using the polytropic process equation:  
\[
p V^n = \text{constant} \quad \text{(where \( n = v \))}
\]  

The volume \( V_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{RT_g}{p} = 3.14 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3
\]
