The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M} = 166.28 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{molÂ·K}}
\]  
The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is determined as:  
\[
A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  
The pressure exerted by the ice-water mixture (\( p_{\text{EW}} \)) is given by:  
\[
p_{\text{EW}} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_g \cdot g}{A} = 1.3937 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The gas pressure (\( p_g \)) is calculated as:  
\[
p_g = p_{\text{EW}} + \frac{m_{\text{EW}} \cdot g}{A} \approx 1.4009 \, \text{bar}
\]  
Using the ideal gas law \( PV = mRT \), the gas mass is determined:  
\[
m = 3.42 \, \text{g}
\]
