The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{1}{A}(m_K g + m_{\text{EW}} g)
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 120005 \, \text{Pa} = 1.20 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the cylinder is calculated as:  
\[
A = \pi (0.05 \, \text{m})^2 = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  
The mass of the gas \( m_g \) is determined using:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
m_g = 3422 \, \text{g}
\]
