A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn, showing the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes four states labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), and \( 4 \). The process transitions are described as follows:  
- \( 1 \to 2 \): Isobaric process.  
- \( 2 \to 3 \): Adiabatic process with isentropic compression.  
- \( 3 \to 4 \): Isobaric process.  
- \( 4 \to 1 \): Isentropic process.  

The axes are labeled:  
- \( p \) [bar] on the vertical axis.  
- \( T \) [K] on the horizontal axis.
