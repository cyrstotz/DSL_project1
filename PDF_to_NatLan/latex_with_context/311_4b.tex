The energy balance for the compressor is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{W}_K
\]  
where \( \dot{W}_K \) represents the work input to the compressor, \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are the specific enthalpies at the inlet and outlet of the compressor, and \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate.  

A diagram is sketched showing the flow of energy through the compressor, with arrows indicating work input (\( \dot{W}_K \)) and enthalpy changes (\( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \)).  

The mass flow rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

It is noted that entropy remains constant during the compression process:  
\[
s_2 = s_3
\]
