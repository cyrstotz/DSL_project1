The following values are provided:  
\[
T_1 = 100^\circ\text{C} = 373 \, \text{K}, \quad T_2 = 70^\circ\text{C} = 343 \, \text{K}, \quad T_w = 20^\circ\text{C} = 293 \, \text{K}
\]  
The heat released during cooling is:  
\[
Q_R = Q_{\text{out}} = 35 \, \text{MJ}
\]  
The total reactor mass is:  
\[
m_{\text{total}} = 5755 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The change in internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U = U_2 - U_1 = Q_R - Q_1
\]  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} h_i + \dot{Q}
\]
