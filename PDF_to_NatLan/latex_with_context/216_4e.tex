Interpolation is performed to find intermediate enthalpy values:  
\[
h_{f1} = -20 + 12 \cdot \frac{39.54 - 34.97}{24 + 34.39} = 36.965 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
h_{g1} = -10 + 12 \cdot \frac{205.57 - 203}{20 + 203} = 203.389 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The explanation for the evolution of \( T_i \):  
The temperature \( T_i \) would first increase due to the heat transfer from the refrigerant. Once equilibrium is reached, the temperature would stabilize.
