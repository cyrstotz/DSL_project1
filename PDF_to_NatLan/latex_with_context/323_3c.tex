The first law of thermodynamics for the gas is written as:  
\[
\delta Q = \delta U = Q - \delta W
\]  
The internal energy change is expressed as:  
\[
\delta U = c_p^{ig} (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
The gas constant \( R \) is defined as:  
\[
R = c_p^{ig} - c_v^{ig}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
R = 166.28 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg·K}} - 0.633 \cdot 10^3 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg·K}} = c_p^{ig}
\]  
The internal energy change is then:  
\[
\delta U = m_g c_p^{ig} (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) = Q_{12}
\]
