The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) in state 1 are calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
pV = mRT
\]  
Given:  
- \( T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} \)  
- \( V_{g,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L} \)  
- \( M_g = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol} \)  
- \( R = \frac{8.31}{M_g} = \frac{8.31}{50} = 0.1662 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)  

The calculation for \( p_{g,1} \) appears partially crossed out, but the formula setup is visible:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{mRT}{V}
\]
