The diagram below is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram.  

Description of the diagram:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin, ranging from \( 243.15 \, \text{K} \) to \( 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  
- The process is labeled with states 1 through 6, showing the progression of the jet engine cycle.  
- Curves labeled "Isobars" represent constant pressure lines, including \( 1.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- Arrows indicate the direction of the process, with transitions between states labeled as "isentropic" or "isobaric."  
- The diagram includes annotations for key transitions, such as compression, combustion, and expansion.  

Key features:  
- State 1 to 2: Compression (isentropic).  
- State 2 to 3: Combustion (isobaric).  
- State 3 to 4: Expansion (isentropic).  
- State 5 to 6: Mixing and nozzle exit.  

The diagram visually illustrates the thermodynamic behavior of the jet engine cycle.
