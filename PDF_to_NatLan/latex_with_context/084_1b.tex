The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{h_e - h_a}{s_e - s_a}
\]  
where \( h_e \) and \( h_a \) are enthalpies, and \( s_e \) and \( s_a \) are entropies.  

Additionally, the energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} \left[ s_e - s_a \right] + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T} = 0
\]  
Rearranging for \( T \):  
\[
T = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{\dot{m} \left[ s_e - s_a \right]}
\]
