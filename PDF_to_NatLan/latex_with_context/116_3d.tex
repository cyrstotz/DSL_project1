The first law of thermodynamics for the ice chamber is written as:  
\[
m_{\text{ice-water}} [u_2 - u_1] = Q = 1361.57 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = 1361.57 - 200.059 = -186.1771 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The ice fraction \( x_2 \) in the final state is determined using the solid-liquid equilibrium:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{-186.1771 + 0.045}{-333.458 + 0.045} = 0.559
\]
