A graph is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram. The diagram includes labeled phase regions for liquid, gas, and solid. The curve transitions between these phases, with points labeled as 1, 2, and 3. The temperature axis includes a mark at \(T_i = -10^\circ\text{C}\).
