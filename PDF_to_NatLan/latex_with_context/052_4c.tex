The enthalpy at state 4 (\( h_4 \)) is determined, assuming \( x > 0 \) and \( \Delta h \) is given. Thus:  
\[
h_4 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_4 - h_1) \implies h_4 - h_1
\]  

The pressure is given as:  
\[
p = 4.2391 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_4 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = 0.337
\]
