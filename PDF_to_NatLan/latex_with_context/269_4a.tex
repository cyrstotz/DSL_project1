The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) plot showing the freeze-drying process. It includes labeled phase regions: solid, vapor, and liquid. The triple point is marked, and the process paths are labeled as isobaric, isothermal, and adiabatic. The axes are labeled as \( p \) (pressure) and \( T \) (temperature).
