The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_K g}{A} + \frac{m_{\text{EW}} g}{A}
\]  
The area \( A \) is determined as:  
\[
A = \pi r^2 = 0.0314
\]  
Substituting values, \( p_{g,1} \) is found to be:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 2 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The mass \( m \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p V = m R T \quad \Rightarrow \quad m = \frac{p V}{R T} = 1.75
\]
