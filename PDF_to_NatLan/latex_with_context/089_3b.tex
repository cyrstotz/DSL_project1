The thermodynamic equilibrium condition is stated:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},2} = T_{g,2}
\]  

An energy balance is applied to the ice-water mixture (EW) and the gas:  
\[
\Delta m_{\text{EW}} (U_{2}^{\text{EW}} - U_{1}^{\text{EW}}) + m_g (U_{2}^{g} - U_{1}^{g}) = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
It is noted that only the gas volume changes.  

Simplifying the energy balance:  
\[
\Delta m_{\text{EW}} (u_{2}^{\text{EW}} - u_{1}^{\text{EW}}) + m_g c_V (T_{2,g} - T_{1,g}) = m_g R \frac{T_{2,g} - T_{1,g}}{\nabla - \nabla}
\]  

This equation relates the heat transfer and the temperature change between states 1 and 2.
