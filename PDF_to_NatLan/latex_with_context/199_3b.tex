The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is given as \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), because the ice cannot melt further at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The gas pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to the ambient pressure \( p_{\text{amb}} \):  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{\text{amb}} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]
(This pressure was calculated in part (a).)
