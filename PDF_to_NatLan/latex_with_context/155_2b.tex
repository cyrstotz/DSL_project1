The first law of thermodynamics is applied to the nozzle:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} \right)
\]
Simplified to:  
\[
0 = h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2}
\]  
Further rearranged:  
\[
h_5 - h_6 = c_p (T_5 - T_6)
\]  

The nozzle is described as isentropic.

The entropy difference between states 5 and 6 is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
s_5 - s_6 = 0 = c_p \int_{T_6}^{T_5} \frac{1}{T} \, dT - R \ln \left( \frac{p_5}{p_6} \right)
\]  

The equation simplifies to:  
\[
0 = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}} \cdot \text{(integral term crossed out)} - R \ln \left( \frac{p_5}{p_6} \right)
\]  

The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = c_p - \frac{c_p}{n} = 0.2874 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}}
\]  

The pressures are given as:  
\[
p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}, \quad p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The entropy equation becomes:  
\[
0.276575 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}} = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}} \ln \left( \frac{431.9 \, \text{K}}{T_6} \right)
\]  

Simplifying further:  
\[
0.274925 = \ln \left( \frac{431.9 \, \text{K}}{T_6} \right)
\]  

Exponentiating both sides:  
\[
1.316433 = \frac{431.9 \, \text{K}}{T_6}
\]  

Solving for \( T_6 \):  
\[
T_6 = 328.08 \, \text{K}
\]
