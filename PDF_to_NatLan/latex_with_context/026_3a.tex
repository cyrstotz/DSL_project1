The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_c g}{A} + \frac{m_{\text{mem}} g}{A}
\]  
The area \( A \) is determined as:  
\[
A = \pi \frac{D^2}{4} = 7.85 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^2
\]  
Substituting values, the result is:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 3.443 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The ambient pressure is given as:  
\[
p_{\text{amb}} = 1.1 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas mass \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
\frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} = m_g
\]  
Substituting values, the result is:  
\[
m_g = 3.429 \, \text{g}
\]  
The specific gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g} = 0.16628 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]
