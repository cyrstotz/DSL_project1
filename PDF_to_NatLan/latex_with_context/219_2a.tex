The page begins with a diagram representing the jet engine process flow. The states are labeled sequentially from 1 to 6, with arrows indicating the transitions between states. The following values are noted:  
- \( T = -30^\circ\text{C} \)  
- \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  

Below this, a detailed \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes the following features:  
- States 1 through 6 are marked.  
- Isobaric and isentropic processes are labeled in red and black, respectively.  
- Pressure values are noted at specific points: \( p_2 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_6 = 0.151 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The transitions between states are shown with curved lines, indicating thermodynamic processes.
