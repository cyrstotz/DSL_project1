In Step ii, if the cooling cycle from Step i continued with constant \( \dot{Q}_K \), the temperature \( T_i \) would evolve based on sublimation conditions.

The system operates under adiabatic reversible conditions. The entropy change \( \Delta S \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S = ...
\]  
(Note: The entropy calculation is incomplete in the handwritten text.)
