The reactor temperature is reduced to \( T_2 = 70^\circ\text{C} \).  

An energy balance is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta m_{12} \cdot h_{\text{ein}} + Q_{\text{out}} + Q_R - W^{70}
\]  
The equation simplifies to:  
\[
m_0 u_2 + \Delta m_{12} u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_e
\]  
Rearranging terms:  
\[
m_{12} u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} (h_e - u_2)
\]  
Finally:  
\[
m_1 \frac{(u_2 - u_1)}{h_e - u_2} = \Delta m_{12}
\]

Continuation:  

The specific internal energy \( u_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
u_1 = u_f + x \cdot (u_g - u_f)
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
u_1 = 918.94 + 0.005 \cdot (2506.5 - 918.94)
\]  
\[
u_1 = 929.3778 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The specific internal energy at \( 70^\circ\text{C} \) is:  
\[
u_2 = u_f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.58 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The specific enthalpy of the added mass at \( 20^\circ\text{C} \) is:  
\[
h_e = h_f(20^\circ\text{C}) = 83.96 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) added to the reactor is determined as:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = 3756.98 \, \text{kg}
\]
