The conditions for \( T_{g,2} \), \( p_{g,2} \), and \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \) are discussed.  

The explanation states that volumes 1 and 2 are constant, and the gas does not expand. The temperature remains constant, \( T_2 = T_1 \), because the volume does not change. The pressure remains constant as \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \), since the system is closed and no external work is done.
