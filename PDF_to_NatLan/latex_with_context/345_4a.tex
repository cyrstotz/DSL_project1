A p-T diagram is drawn to represent the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes labeled phase regions and process steps.  
- The vertical axis represents pressure (\( p \)), and the horizontal axis represents temperature (\( T \)).  
- The diagram shows three states labeled as 1, 2, and 3, connected by arrows to indicate transitions.  
- State 1 is at low pressure and temperature, while state 3 is at higher pressure and temperature.  
- The transitions between states are marked as isobaric and adiabatic processes.
