A pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram is drawn. The diagram shows the phase regions for a substance, including the liquid, vapor, and superheated gas phases. The curve represents the saturation line, with a labeled triple point ("TP") and two steps marked as "i" and "ii". The x-axis is labeled as temperature (\(T\)), and the y-axis is labeled as pressure (\(p\)). The region below the saturation line is labeled "Nassdampf" (wet steam), and the region above is labeled "Gas".
