The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It shows a rectangular cycle with four states labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- State 1 is at the bottom left, representing the low-pressure, low-temperature region.  
- State 2 is at the bottom right, indicating the same pressure as state 1 but at a higher temperature.  
- State 3 is at the top right, showing high pressure and high temperature.  
- State 4 is at the top left, indicating the same pressure as state 3 but at a lower temperature.
