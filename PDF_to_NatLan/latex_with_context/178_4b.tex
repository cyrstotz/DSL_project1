The refrigerant mass flow rate is calculated using the following energy balance equation:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} \cdot (h_3 - h_2)
\]  
where:  
- \(x_t = 1\) (vapor quality at state 1).  
- \(h\) represents specific enthalpy.  

The equation for the rate of change of energy is given as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_3 - h_2) - \dot{V}_K + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
\dot{V}_K = \dot{m} \cdot (h_3 - h_2)
\]  

Additionally, entropy at states 2 and 3 is equal:  
\[
S_2 = S_3
\]
