The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_G \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
T_G = T_5 \left( \frac{p_c}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} = 328.05 \, \text{K}
\]

Additional calculations are shown for the outlet velocity \( w_6 \):  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{w_5^2 + \frac{2 \, \dot{m}_K}{\dot{m}_M}}
\]

The specific gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{c_p - c_v}{\kappa} = 0.257 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]

The specific volume \( v_c \) is determined:  
\[
v_c = \frac{R T_c}{p_c} = 4.34 \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg}
\]

The specific heat capacity ratio \( c_{p,\text{air}} \) is given as:  
\[
c_{p,\text{air}} = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]
