The energy equation for the system is written under the assumption of steady-state conditions:  
\[
\dot{m} \left( \frac{w_2^2}{2} + h_2 \right) - \dot{m} \left( \frac{w_1^2}{2} + h_1 \right) = 0
\]  

The following calculations are performed:  
The temperature at state \( s_5 \) is given as \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \), and the table A-22 is referenced for data. The pressure \( p_5 \) is noted as \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  

The enthalpy \( h_2 \) at \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \) is calculated using table data:  
\[
h_2(T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K}) = \frac{h_{g}(431.9) - h_{f}(431.9)}{104} \cdot (1.431) + h_{f}(431.9) = 133.36
\]  

The enthalpy \( h_a \) at \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) is calculated using interpolation:  
\[
h_a(0.5 \, \text{bar}) = h_{g,0.5 \, \text{bar}} - h_{f,0.5 \, \text{bar}} \cdot (0.5 - 0.4690) + h_{f,0.4690}
\]
