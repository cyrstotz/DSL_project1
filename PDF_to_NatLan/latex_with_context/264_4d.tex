The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{\dot{W}_u}
\]  
This can also be expressed as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{zu}}}{\left( \dot{Q}_{\text{ab}} - \dot{Q}_{\text{zu}} \right)}
\]  
This formula applies specifically for refrigeration cycles.  

In this case, the coefficient of performance is given by:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\left( \dot{Q}_{\text{ab}} - \dot{Q}_x \right)}
\]
