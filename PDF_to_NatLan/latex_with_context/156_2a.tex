Two diagrams are drawn to represent thermodynamic processes on a \( T \)-\( s \) (temperature-entropy) diagram.  

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The diagram shows a process with labeled isobars \( P_0 \), \( P_4 \), and \( P_5 \).  
   - The curve starts at point \( 1 \), moves through points \( 2 \), \( 3 \), and ends at \( 4 \).  
   - The isobars are curved lines, and the process transitions between them.  
   - The axes are labeled \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (entropy).  

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - This diagram also represents thermodynamic processes on a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram.  
   - It includes labeled isobars \( P_0 \), \( P_4 \), \( P_5 \), and \( P_7 \).  
   - The process starts at point \( 1 \), moves through points \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and ends at \( 6 \).  
   - The axes are labeled \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (entropy).
