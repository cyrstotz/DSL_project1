The process is described as isentropic, with \( n = \kappa = 1.4 \).  

The temperature at state \( 6 \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
Substituting the given values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.191 \, \text{bar}}{0.5 \, \text{bar}} \right)^{\frac{1.4-1}{1.4}}
\]  
\[
T_6 = 328.075 \, \text{K}
\]  

The final temperature at state \( 6 \) is:  
\[
T_6 = 328.075 \, \text{K}
\]
