Energy balance for the gas:  

The energy change is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q_{12} - W_u
\]  

Using internal energy and heat transfer:  
\[
m(u_2 - u_1) + U_v = Q_{12}
\]  

Expanding the energy balance:  
\[
m c_V (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) + \frac{R (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1})}{1 - \kappa} = Q_{12}
\]  

The volume at state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m_g R_g T_{g,2}}{p_{g,2}}
\]
