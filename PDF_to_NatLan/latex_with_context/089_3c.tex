The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is given as \( 0.0002^\circ\text{C} \).  

An energy balance for the gas system is described as closed and adiabatic:  
\[
m_g (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12} - W_v
\]  
The work \( W_v \) is expressed as:  
\[
W_v = R \frac{(T_{g,2} - T_{g,1})}{1 - n}
\]  
where \( n = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = 1.2626 \), and \( c_p = R + c_v = 0.29228 \).  

The energy equation is expanded:  
\[
m_g c_v (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) + W_v = Q_{12}
\]
