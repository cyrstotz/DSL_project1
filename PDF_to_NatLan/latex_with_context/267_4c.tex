The enthalpy at state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
h_1 = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) + x_1 \cdot h_{fg} = 13.42 + 0.3 \cdot 76 = 36.6 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is determined:  
\[
x_1 = 0.3
\]  

At \( T_1 = -16^\circ \text{C} \), the coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]
