The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\lvert \dot{Q}_{\text{zu}} \rvert}{\lvert \dot{W}_K \rvert}
\]  
Here, \( \dot{Q}_{\text{zu}} \) represents the useful heat transfer, and \( \dot{W}_K \) is the work input to the system. The term "nutz" refers to the useful energy, while "Aufwand" refers to the effort or input energy. A note indicates a value of \( 28 \, \text{W} \) for \( \dot{W}_K \).
