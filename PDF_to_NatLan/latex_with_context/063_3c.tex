The first law of thermodynamics is applied:  
\[
\Delta U = Q - W
\]  

The change in internal energy is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta U = m_g (u_2 - u_1) = c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta U = 0.633 \cdot (273.75 - 773.15) = -316.5 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The work done is expressed as:  
\[
W = p (V_{2} - V_{1}) = 28.5 \, \text{kPa} \cdot (273.75 \, \text{K})
\]  
(This part contains some crossed-out calculations and unclear values, but the final work term is incomplete.)  

The volume \( V_2 \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m R T_2}{p_2}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{3.9 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \cdot R \cdot 273.75 \, \text{K}}{9.8 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{Pa}} = 0.0077 \, \text{m}^3
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q = \Delta U + W = -316.5 \cdot 10^3 + 2850 = -376.3 \, \text{kJ}
\]
