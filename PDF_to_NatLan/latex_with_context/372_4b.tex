The following equations and calculations are written:  

1. The heat transfer equation:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{W}
\]  

2. A simplified form of the equation:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_3)
\]  

3. The entropy relationship:  
\[
s_3 = s_2 = s_{2, \text{liquid}}
\]  

4. The temperature at state 2 is given:  
\[
T_i = 20^\circ\text{C} = 293.15 \, \text{K}
\]  

5. Additional calculations and expressions are partially crossed out and illegible.
