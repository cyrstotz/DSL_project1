The task involves drawing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. Two diagrams are sketched:  
- The first diagram shows a series of curves representing the thermodynamic process, with labeled axes \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (entropy). The curves include isobars and transitions between states.  
- The second diagram includes arrows indicating directions of processes and transitions between states, with intersecting lines representing different thermodynamic paths.

The following equations are used to calculate the exergy terms:  

\[
0 \cdot ex_{str} = 1.006 (328.1 - 243.15) - \frac{243.15}{328} \left( 1.006 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{328.15}{243.15} \right) \right) + \frac{400.55^2}{2}
\]

\[
0 \cdot ex_{str} = 80.2 \cdot 31.17 \, \text{J/s} = 80.2 \, \text{kJ/s}
\]
