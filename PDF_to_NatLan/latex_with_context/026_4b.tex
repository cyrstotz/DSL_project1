The energy balance for the transition from state 2 to state 3 is expressed as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_R (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{Q} + \dot{W}_K
\]  
For an adiabatic process, the heat transfer term \( \dot{Q} \) is zero. Therefore:  
\[
\dot{m}_R (h_2 - h_3) = \dot{W}_K
\]  
Rewriting:  
\[
\dot{W}_K = \dot{m}_R (h_2 - h_3)
\]  
Additionally, \( h_2 \) is given as:  
\[
h_2 = h_g \cdot x
\]
