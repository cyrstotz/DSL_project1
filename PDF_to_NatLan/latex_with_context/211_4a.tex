Two diagrams are drawn to represent the freeze-drying process.  

1. **Diagram i**:  
   - The graph is a pressure-temperature (\(P\)-\(T\)) diagram.  
   - The labeled states (1, 2, 3, 4) are shown in the three-phase region.  
   - The process transitions between gas and liquid phases.  
   - A note states: "All states are in the three-phase region."  

2. **Diagram ii**:  
   - Another \(P\)-\(T\) diagram is shown with a focus on the liquid and gas phases.  
   - The temperature difference (\(\Delta T = 10 \, \text{K}\)) is highlighted.  
   - The process transitions between liquid and gas phases.
