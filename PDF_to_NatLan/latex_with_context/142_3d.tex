The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is determined using the equation:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_f - u_{fl}}
\]  
where \( u_f \) is the specific internal energy of the saturated liquid, and \( u_{fl} \) is the specific internal energy of the saturated solid. Substituting the values, \( x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.713 \).  

The internal energy at state 1, \( u_1 \), is calculated as:  
\[
u_1 = u_{fl} + x_{\text{ice},1} \cdot (u_f - u_{fl})
\]  
Substituting the values, \( u_1 = -200.0928 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).
