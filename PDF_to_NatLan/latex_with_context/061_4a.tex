A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn, showing the phase regions for solid, liquid, and gas. The curve represents the phase boundaries, with labels indicating "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). The diagram includes a marked point labeled "Schluss" (end) and a region labeled "noch nicht gefroren" (not yet frozen). The temperature axis is labeled \( T \), and the pressure axis is labeled \( p \).
