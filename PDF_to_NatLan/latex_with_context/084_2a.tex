The process is described qualitatively in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars and transitions between states. The following processes are indicated:  
- \( 0 \to 1 \): Isentropic compression, \( T_1 \).  
- \( 1 \to 2 \): Isentropic compression, \( T_2 \).  
- \( 2 \to 3 \): Isobaric heating, \( T_3 \).  
- \( 3 \to 4 \): Irreversible turbine process, \( T_4 \).  
- \( 4 \to 5 \): Isobaric mixing of bypass and core streams, \( T_5 \).  
- \( 5 \to 6 \): Isentropic expansion, \( T_6 \).  

The diagram shows increasing entropy for the turbine process and isothermal mixing at state \( 5 \). The student notes that the drawing is incomplete and apologizes for missing details.
