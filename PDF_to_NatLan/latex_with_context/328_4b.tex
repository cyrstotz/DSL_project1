The initial temperature \( T_i \) is given as \( -26^\circ\text{C} \). The temperature difference is calculated as \( T_1 - T_2 = -32^\circ\text{C} \).  

A table is provided with the following columns: \( T \), \( P \), \( V \times Q \), and \( W \). The rows correspond to states 1, 2, 3, and 4:  
- State 1: \( T_i - 6 \), \( P \)  
- State 2: \( T_i - 6 \), \( P \)  
- State 3: \( 8 \), \( P \)  
- State 4: \( 8 \), \( 0 \)  

The heat transfer \( Q_{\text{23}} \) is noted as \( 28 \, W \).
