The vapor quality \(x_1\) directly after the expansion (drossel) is calculated.  

The temperature after expansion is given as:  
\[
T_1 = T_i - 6 \, \text{K}
\]  

The process from state 4 to state 1 is described as adiabatic.  

The vapor quality \(x_1\) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x = \frac{s_A - s_{if}}{s_g - s_{if}}
\]  

A small diagram is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (\(P\)-\(T\)) graph with a phase region. The state after expansion is marked within the phase region.  

Additional notes are written at the bottom:  
\[
\frac{q}{\dot{m}} = 0 \quad \frac{T_m - T_c}{T_m} = 5 \, \text{cm}
\]  
\[
\frac{q}{\dot{m}} = \frac{k}{T_m}
\]  

Descriptions of the diagrams and equations are partially crossed out but remain legible.
