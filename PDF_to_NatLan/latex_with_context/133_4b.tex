The process transitions between states are described:
- From state 2 to state 3: Isentropic compression occurs (\( s = \text{constant} \)).  
- From state 2 to state 3: The refrigerant is gaseous, transitioning to a mixture of liquid and vapor.  
- From state 4 to state 1: Isenthalpic throttling occurs.

### First Law of Thermodynamics:
The energy balance for the cycle is given as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K
\]  
Where \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are specific enthalpies at states 2 and 3, respectively, and \( \dot{W}_K \) is the work input to the compressor.
