At state 2, equilibrium is reached, and the change in internal energy (\( \Delta U \)) is zero:  
\[
\Delta U = \Delta U_{\text{gas}} + \Delta U_{\text{EW}}
\]  
For the gas:  
\[
\Delta U_{\text{gas}} = c_V (T_{g2} - T_{g1})
\]  
For the ice-water mixture (EW):  
\[
\Delta U_{\text{EW}} = c_{\text{if}} (T_{2\text{EW}} - T_{1\text{EW}})
\]  

It is given that \( T_{g2} = T_{2\text{EW}} = 0.003^\circ\text{C} \).  

Using the energy balance:  
\[
\Delta E = Q - W_v = 0
\]  
Thus:  
\[
Q = W_v \quad \Rightarrow \quad q = w_v = \frac{R(T_2 - T_1)}{1 - n}
\]  
Where \( R = \frac{c_V (k - 1)}{R} + 1 = k \).
