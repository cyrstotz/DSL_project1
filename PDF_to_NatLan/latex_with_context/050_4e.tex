The process involves an "adiabatic throttle" and is described as "isenthalpic."  

The enthalpy values are given:  
\[
h_1 = h_4
\]  
\[
h_2 (8 \, \text{bar}, x = 0) = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The final statement reads:  
"Now I need \( T_1 \)."  

No additional calculations or diagrams are provided for this task.

The text states:  
"Temperatur w√ºrde fallen."  
Translation: "The temperature would decrease."  

No additional explanation is provided.
