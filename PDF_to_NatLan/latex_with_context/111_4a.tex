The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) plot showing phase regions for a substance. The solid phase ("Fest") is on the left, the liquid phase ("Fl√ºssig") is in the middle, and the gas phase ("Gas") is on the right. Two processes are labeled:  
1) Step i: A vertical line from the liquid phase to the gas phase, representing isobaric evaporation.  
2) Step ii: A horizontal line from the liquid phase to the solid phase, representing sublimation.
