The diagram shows a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin, and the horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \text{J/kgÂ·K} \). The process includes labeled isobars \( p_5 \) and \( p_0/p_6 \). An adiabatic compressor is indicated with an upward arrow, and the flow transitions between the isobars.
