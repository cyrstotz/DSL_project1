The task involves drawing the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. Several diagrams are sketched, showing the phase regions and transitions.  

1. **First diagram**:  
   - The \( p \)-\( T \) curve is drawn with labeled axes (\( P \) in bar and \( T \) in Kelvin).  
   - A dome-shaped curve represents the phase boundary.  
   - Two points are marked:  
     - Point 1 is near the lower pressure region.  
     - Point 2 is inside the dome, indicating a phase transition.  
   - An isobaric line is drawn across the dome.  

2. **Second diagram**:  
   - Similar \( p \)-\( T \) curve with the dome-shaped phase boundary.  
   - Point 2 is marked inside the dome, and an arrow indicates a transition.  

3. **Table of values**:  
   - A table is provided with columns for \( P \), \( T \), and other variables:  
     - Row 1: \( P_u \), unspecified temperature.  
     - Row 2: \( P = 8 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = -22^\circ\text{C} \), \( x_2 = 1 \).  
     - Row 3: \( P = 8 \, \text{bar} \), unspecified temperature, \( x_3 = 1 \).  
     - Row 4: \( P = 8 \, \text{bar} \), unspecified temperature, \( x_4 = 0 \).  

4. **Equations and notes**:  
   - \( a_{41} = 0 \).  
   - \( P_u = S_{\text{mbar}} + P_{\text{tp}} \).  
   - \( T_i - 10 \, \text{K} = T_{\text{sublimation point}} \).  
   - \( S_3 = S_2 \).  
   - \( T_i - T_3 = 6 \, \text{K} \).  

5. **Additional diagrams**:  
   - Another \( p \)-\( T \) curve is drawn with labeled points 2, 3, and 4.  
   - Isobaric and isentropic lines are indicated.
