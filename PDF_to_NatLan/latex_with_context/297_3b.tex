The ice mass fraction in state 1 is given as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.6
\]  
The pressure in state 2 is equal to the pressure in state 1:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]  
This is because the change in the ice fraction does not significantly affect the pressure difference between the gas and the ice-water mixture. There is no change in the gravitational force acting on the piston, and the volume of the ice-water mixture remains constant.
