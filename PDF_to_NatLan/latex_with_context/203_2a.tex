The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process in a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and process paths:  
- State 0: Ambient conditions.  
- State 1: Isentropic compression.  
- State 2: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 3: Isentropic expansion in the turbine.  
- State 4: Isobaric mixing.  
- State 5: Isentropic acceleration in the nozzle.  
The axes are labeled as \( T \, [K] \) for temperature and \( s \, [\text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K}] \) for entropy.
