The pressure of the gas (\( p_{\text{gas}} \)) is calculated as:  
\[
p_{\text{gas}} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_K g}{A}
\]  
where:  
- \( p_{\text{amb}} = 1 \, \text{bar} \) (ambient pressure),  
- \( m_K = 32 \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the piston),  
- \( g \) is the gravitational acceleration,  
- \( A = \frac{D^2}{4} \pi \) is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder, with \( D = 10 \, \text{cm} \).  

Substituting values:  
\[
p_{\text{gas}} = 1.399 \, \text{bar} \approx 1.4 \, \text{bar}.
