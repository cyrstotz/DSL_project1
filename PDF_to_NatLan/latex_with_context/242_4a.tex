The diagram is a qualitative \( p \)-\( T \) graph showing the freeze-drying process. It includes labeled phase regions for the refrigerant cycle. The curve represents the phase boundary, with points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4 corresponding to different states in the cycle. The axis labels are \( p \) (pressure) and \( T \) (temperature).
