The process involves an adiabatic throttle, where \( h_4 = h_1 \) according to the first law of thermodynamics.  

The vapor quality at state 4 is given as \( x_4 = 0 \). The pressure at state 4 is \( p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar} \) (isobaric process from state 3 to state 4).  

From Table A-11:  
\[
h_4 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} = h_1
\]  

For state 2, the pressure is \( p_2 = p_1 \) (isobaric process). From Table A-10, at \( T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C} \), the pressure is:  
\[
p_2 = 1.21926 \, \text{bar} = p_1
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_A \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_A = \frac{h_A - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_A = 0.337
\]
