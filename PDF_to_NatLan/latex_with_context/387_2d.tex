The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is calculated using the following equation:  

\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = ex_Q - ex_S
\]

The term \( ex_Q \) is defined as:  

\[
ex_Q = \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{1289 \, \text{K}} \right) q_B
\]

Substituting the given values:  

\[
ex_Q = 965.57 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

Thus, the final value for \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is:  

\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = 965.58 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
