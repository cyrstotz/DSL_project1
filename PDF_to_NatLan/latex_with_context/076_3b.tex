To determine \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \), the following reasoning is applied:

1. **Pressure remains constant**:  
   \[
   p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
   \]  
   This is because the pressure due to the piston and weight remains unchanged.

2. **Thermal equilibrium**:  
   At state 2, the gas and EW are in thermal equilibrium, so:  
   \[
   U_g = U_{\text{EW}}
   \]  

No further numerical calculations are provided for \( T_{g,2} \).
