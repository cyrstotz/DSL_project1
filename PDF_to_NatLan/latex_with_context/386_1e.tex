The entropy change is calculated using the equation:  
\[
\Delta S = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1
\]  

The specific entropy values are:  
\[
s_1 = 1.3069 + x_0 (7.3550 - 1.3069) = 1.337 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
\[
s_2 = 0.359 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \quad \text{(from Table A-2)}
\]  

The entropy change is then calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S = (m_1 + \Delta m_2) s_2 - m_1 s_1 = 1388.921 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]
