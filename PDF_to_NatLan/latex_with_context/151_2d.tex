The mass-specific exergy destruction is calculated as:  
\[
ex_{\text{res}} = T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
The entropy generation term is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = (s_6 - s_0) - \frac{q_i}{T_0}
\]  
Since \( q_i = 0 \), the expression simplifies to:  
\[
ex_{\text{res}} = T_0 (s_6 - s_0)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
ex_{\text{res}} = 293 (s_6 - s_0)
\]
