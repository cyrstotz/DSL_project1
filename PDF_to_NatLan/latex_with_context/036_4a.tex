The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) plot illustrating the freeze-drying process. It consists of a rectangular cycle with four labeled states:  
- State \(1 \to 2\): Isobaric process.  
- State \(2 \to 3\): Isothermal process.  
- State \(3 \to 4\): Isobaric process.  
- State \(4 \to 1\): Isothermal process.  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents pressure (\(p\)).  
- The horizontal axis represents temperature (\(T\)).
