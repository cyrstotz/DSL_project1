The graph represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis, and entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis. The curve shows the thermodynamic process with labeled points:  
- Point \( 0 \): Initial state.  
- Point \( 1 \): Compression process.  
- Point \( 2 \): Combustion process.  
- Point \( 3 \): Expansion in the turbine.  
- Point \( 4 \): Mixing process.
