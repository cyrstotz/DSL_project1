The gas pressure \( p_{g,2} \) should remain constant because \( p_{\text{amb}} \) does not change, and the mass of the piston remains constant.  
\[
p_{g,2} = 1.44 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The temperature of the gas in state 2 (\( T_{g,2} \)) is explained:  
The water does not undergo significant changes in energy, as the gas temperature decreases to reach thermal equilibrium. The gas adjusts itself to the temperature of the water.  
\[
T_{g,2} \approx 0^\circ\text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K}
\]
