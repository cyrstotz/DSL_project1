A diagram is drawn showing the freeze-drying process with a refrigeration cycle using R134a. The diagram is a p-T graph with labeled regions and states:  
- State 1 is in the "Dampf-Flüssig zweiphasiges Gebiet" (vapor-liquid two-phase region).  
- State 2 is labeled as "Gas."  
- State 3 is labeled as "Isobar \( p_3 > 8 \, \text{bar} \)."  
- State 4 is labeled as "Flüssig" (liquid).  
The process transitions between these states, with arrows indicating the flow of the cycle.
