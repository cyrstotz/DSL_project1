The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) in the engine is calculated using the exergy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( ex_{\text{flow},0} - ex_{\text{flow},6} \right) - W_t - \dot{E}_{\text{rev}}
\]  

The exergy destruction is expressed as:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = ex_{\text{flow},0} - ex_{\text{flow},6} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_B} \right) q_B
\]  

Substituting values, the exergy destruction is:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = 849.335 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Corrections and annotations are visible in the equations, including a note that \( p_6 = p_0 \), simplifying the entropy calculation.
