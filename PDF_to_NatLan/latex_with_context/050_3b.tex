The final state is described as \( T_g = T_{\text{EW}} \), meaning the gas and the ice-water mixture reach thermal equilibrium.  

The system is balanced, and the process is isothermal at \( T_a = 0.003^\circ \text{C} \).  

The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q  
\]  
where \( u_2 \) and \( u_1 \) are specific internal energies.  

A small sketch is included, showing a box labeled \( Q_{12} \), with arrows indicating heat transfer.  

The text mentions "Pkompressibel = Pisochor," suggesting incompressible behavior or constant volume.
