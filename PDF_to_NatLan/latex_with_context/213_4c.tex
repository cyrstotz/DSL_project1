The temperature \( T_2 \) is given as \( -22^\circ\text{C} \).

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
\dot{m} (h_2 - h_1) + \dot{Q}_K = 0
\]

Since \( T_2 = T_1 \), it follows that \( h_2 = h_1 \).

The enthalpy \( h_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
h_1 = h_f(-22^\circ\text{C}) + x \cdot h_{fg}(-22^\circ\text{C})
\]

The vapor quality \( x \) is determined as:  
\[
x = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_{fg}} = \frac{93.92 - 21.77}{212.32} = 0.3374
\]
