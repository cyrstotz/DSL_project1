The temperature of the gas in state 2 is given as \( T_{g,2} = 0.0003^\circ\text{C} \).  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q + W = \Delta U + W
\]  

Given \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0.0003^\circ\text{C} \), the internal energy change is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) + W = Q
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta E = 0.633 \cdot (0.0003 - 500) = Q
\]  

An equation for velocity is partially written:  
\[
v_{2} = \frac{v_2}{m_2}
\]  
where \( m_2 = m_1 \).
