A graph is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram. The diagram includes labeled phase regions: "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gasförmig" (gaseous). The triple point is marked, and the curve transitions between the phases. The temperature axis is labeled as \( T \) in degrees Celsius (\( ^\circ\text{C} \)). The process path is indicated, showing the isobaric evaporation and sublimation steps.
