The mass flow rate of the refrigerant \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is given as \( 4 \, \text{kg/h} \), which is converted to \( 0.0011 \, \text{kg/s} \).  
The temperature \( T_2 \) is \( -22^\circ\text{C} \), and the pressure \( p_1 = p_2 \) is \( 5.935 \, \text{bar} \).  
The enthalpy \( h_1 = h_4 = h(8 \, \text{bar}, x = 0) = 53.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  
The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f(p_1)}{h_g(p_1) - h_f(p_1)} = 0.0777
\]
