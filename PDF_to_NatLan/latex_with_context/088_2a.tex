The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. It includes labeled isobars and key states:  
- State 0 represents the ambient condition.  
- State 1 is the inlet to the compressor.  
- State 2 is the outlet of the compressor.  
- State 3 is the combustion chamber outlet.  
- State 4 is the turbine outlet.  
- State 5 is the mixing chamber outlet.  
- State 6 is the nozzle exit.  

The process transitions are marked as follows:  
- The compression from state 0 to state 2 is labeled as "isentropic."  
- The combustion process from state 2 to state 3 is labeled as "isobaric \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)."  
- The expansion from state 3 to state 5 is labeled as "adiabatic reversible."  

The axes are labeled:  
- The vertical axis is \( T \) (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is \( s \) (specific entropy), with units \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).
