A graph is drawn representing the jet engine process in a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars (\( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \)) and points corresponding to states \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The process paths are connected with curves and lines, indicating compression, combustion, expansion, and mixing. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (entropy), with units \( \text{K} \) and \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \), respectively.
