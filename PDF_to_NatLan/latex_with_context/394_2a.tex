The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) plot representing the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (\( [K] \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  

The process consists of six states:  
1. State 1 to State 2: A compression process.  
2. State 2 to State 3: Isobaric heat addition at \( p_3 = p_2 \).  
3. State 3 to State 4: Expansion process.  
4. State 4 to State 5: Isobaric heat rejection at \( p_4 = p_5 \).  
5. State 5 to State 6: Isobaric process at \( p_1 = p_6 \).  

Each state is marked with an "X" and connected by curves or lines indicating the respective thermodynamic transitions.
