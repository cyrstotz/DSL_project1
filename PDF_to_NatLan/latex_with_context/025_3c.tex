The heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture, \( Q_{12} \), is calculated using the equation:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_{g,1} - T_{g,2})
\]  
where \( m_g \) is the mass of the gas, \( c_V \) is the specific heat capacity at constant volume, \( T_{g,1} \) is the initial temperature of the gas, and \( T_{g,2} \) is the final temperature of the gas.
