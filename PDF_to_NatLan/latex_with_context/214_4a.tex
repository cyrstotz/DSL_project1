The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process.  
- The graph has labeled regions for "solid" (\( \text{Fest} \)), "liquid" (\( \text{Fl√ºssig} \)), and "gas" (\( \text{Gas} \)).  
- The process is divided into two steps:  
  - Step \( i \): An isobaric process between states \( 1 \) and \( 2 \).  
  - Step \( ii \): An isothermal process between states \( 2 \) and \( 3 \).  
- The curve separating the phase regions represents the equilibrium lines for phase transitions.
