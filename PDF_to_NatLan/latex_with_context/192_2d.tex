A system boundary diagram is drawn, labeled "Sys. Grenze," showing inlet and outlet mass flows (\( \dot{m}_i \) and \( \dot{m}_o \)) with no heat transfer (\( \dot{Q} = 0 \)) and no work transfer (\( \dot{W} = 0 \)). A note indicates that work is used for compression.  

The exergy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE_x}{dt} = \sum \dot{E}_{x,\text{in}} - E_{x,\text{ver}}
\]  
This expands to:  
\[
\dot{e}_{x,0} - \dot{e}_{x,6} - e_{x,\text{ver}}
\]  
A note clarifies that \( \dot{Q} \neq 0 \).  

Description of the diagram:  
The diagram represents a steady-state system boundary with labeled input and output mass flows. It indicates no heat or work transfer across the boundary, with compression work occurring internally.

The equation for exergy destruction is given as:  
\[
O = ex_{0} - ex_{6} + 
\]  

Using entropy considerations, the exergy destruction is expressed as:  
\[
O = \dot{m} (s_e - s_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \dot{S}_{0-z}
\]  

Breaking it down further:  
\[
O = s_e - s_a + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \dot{S}_{0-z}
\]  

Where \( \dot{S}_{0-z} \) is defined as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{0-z} = \frac{ex_{\text{vol}}}{T_0}
\]  

Substituting into the equation:  
\[
O = s_0 - s_e + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \frac{ex_{\text{vol}}}{T_0}
\]  

Rewriting in logarithmic form:  
\[
c \ln \left( \frac{T_0}{T_6} \right) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \frac{ex_{\text{vol}}}{T_0} = 0
\]  

Given values:  
\[
\dot{Q} = 1195 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad T = 1289 \, \text{K}
\]  

The exergy destruction term \( ex_{\text{vol}} \) is calculated as:  
\[
ex_{\text{vol}} = \left( -c \ln \left( \frac{T_0}{T_6} \right) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} \right) \cdot T_0
\]  

Final result:  
\[
ex_{\text{vol}} = -152.1 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

This value is underlined in the solution.
