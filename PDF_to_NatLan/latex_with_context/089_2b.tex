The process is described as isentropic because it is reversible and \( \Delta Q = 0 \). The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
T_6 = T_s \left( \frac{p_6}{p_s} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]
where \( n = k = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = 1.4 \).  

The calculation yields:  
\[
T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]

Additional notes:  
- Energy balance is applied to a stationary system with one mass flow.  
- \( p_e = 0 \).  
- The energy balance equation is:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \left( h_5 - h_e + \frac{w_5^2 - w_e^2}{2} \right) + \dot{Q}_{\text{ext}} - \dot{W}_{\text{ext}}
\]
where \( \dot{Q}_{\text{ext}} \) and \( \dot{W}_{\text{ext}} \) are external heat and work terms.  

It is noted that \( w_e = w_{\text{ext}} = w_{\text{gas}} \).
