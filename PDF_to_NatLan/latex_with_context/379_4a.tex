The page contains a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram illustrating the freeze-drying process.  
- The diagram shows phase regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "vapor."  
- The triple point is marked, and the sublimation region is highlighted.  
- The pressure axis ranges from 1 mbar to 6 mbar, while the temperature axis ranges from \(-102^\circ\text{C}\) to \(0^\circ\text{C}\).  
- The process steps "i" and "ii" are indicated on the diagram, with arrows showing transitions between states.
