The energy balance for the process between states 2 and 3 is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_3 - h_2) - \dot{W}_K
\]  
Rearranging to solve for the mass flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

A diagram is sketched showing the relationship between \( h_2 \), \( h_3 \), and \( \dot{W}_K \). The region is labeled "ges√§ttigter Dampf" (saturated vapor).
