The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{m_g R T_{g,1}}{V_{g,1}}
\]  
where \( R = 266.289 \, \text{J/kgÂ·K} \), and the cross-sectional area of the cylinder is:  
\[
A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  
The total pressure is given by:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{m_{\text{EW}} + m_K}{A} + p_{\text{amb}} = 7.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  
From this, the gas mass \( m_g \) is determined:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} \approx 3.429 \, \text{g}
\]
