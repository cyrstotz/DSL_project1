The refrigerant mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is calculated using the energy balance equation for the evaporator:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{h_e - h_a}
\]  
where \( \dot{W}_k = 28 \, \text{W} \), \( h_e \) is the enthalpy at the evaporator outlet, and \( h_a \) is the enthalpy at the evaporator inlet.
