The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1
\]  
This assumes no kinetic or potential energy contributions.  

The energy balance is also written as:  
\[
\Delta E = U_2 - U_1 = Q - W
\]  

The work done by the system is calculated using the formula for volumetric work:  
\[
W = m \cdot \left( \frac{1}{n-1} \cdot (p_2 v_2 - p_1 v_1) \right)
\]  
where \( v_2 - v_1 \) represents the change in specific volume.

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is given as:  
\[
Q_{12} = -7500 \, \text{J} \quad \text{(heat from the ice-water mixture)}  
\]  
The pressure is \( p = 7.4 \, \text{bar} \), and the temperature is \( T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The energy balance is written as:  
\[
m_1 (u_2 - u_1) = Q  
\]  
This accounts for the change in internal energy due to heat transfer and phase change, assuming constant volume.  

From the equilibrium table:  
\[
u_1 = u_{\text{ice}} + x_{\text{ice},1} \cdot (u_{\text{water}} - u_{\text{ice}})  
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_1 = -331.58 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + 0.6 \cdot (-0.085 - (-331.58))  
\]  
\[
u_1 = -333.612 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}  
\]  

For \( u_2 \):  
\[
u_2 = -333.458 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \cdot x + (1 - x) \cdot 333.458 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}  
\]  

Using the energy balance:  
\[
-\frac{Q}{m} = u_2 - u_1  
\]  
\[
-\frac{-7500 \, \text{kJ}}{3.6 \cdot 10^{-2} \, \text{kg} + 33.472 \, \text{kg}} = 47.942 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - 28.25 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}  
\]  

Solving for \( x \):  
\[
x = \frac{u_2 - (-333.458 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}})}{-0.085 + 333.458 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}}  
\]  
\[
x = 0.029 \approx 0.757 \quad \text{(final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \))}  
\]
