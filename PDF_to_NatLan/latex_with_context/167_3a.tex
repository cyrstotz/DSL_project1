The pressure \( p \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
p = \frac{m_g}{V_g} R T
\]  
Substituting values, the pressure is determined to be approximately \( 7.40094 \, \text{bar} \).  

The mass \( m \) of the gas is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p V = m R T
\]  
Rearranging for \( m \):  
\[
m = \frac{p V}{R T}
\]  
The result is \( m = 3.4017 \, \text{g} \).
