The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated as follows:

\[
\Delta S_{12} = S_1 - S_2 = m_1 S_1 - m_2 S_2
\]

Where:  
\( m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg} \)  
\( m_2 = 9355 \, \text{kg} \)  

For the specific entropy values:  
\( S_1 = 0.005 \cdot 7.3549 + 0.985 \cdot 1.3068 = 1.33714 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)  
\( S_2 = 6.9549 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)  

Substituting these values:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = -1237.85 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

This represents the total entropy change during the transition from state 1 to state 2.
