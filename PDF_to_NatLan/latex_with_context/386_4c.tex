The enthalpy values are used from part b:  
\[
h_q = 93.92 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \quad (\text{from above})
\]  
\[
h_1 = h_q = 93.92 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The enthalpy at \(h_f(-6^\circ\text{C})\) is calculated as:  
\[
h_f(-6^\circ\text{C}) = 305.51 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - (19.25 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}})
\]  
\[
h_f(-6^\circ\text{C}) = 492.945 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The vapor quality \(x_1\) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{93.92 - 492.945}{293.72 - 492.945} = 0.2599
\]  

An additional note explains that an error was made in earlier calculations due to using incorrect temperatures, which affected the results.
