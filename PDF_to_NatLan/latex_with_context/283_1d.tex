The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{R,12} - Q_{\text{aus}} + \Delta m_{12} \cdot h(200)
\]  
Here, \( Q_{R,12} \) represents the heat released during cooling, \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) is the heat removed, and \( \Delta m_{12} \cdot h(200) \) accounts for the enthalpy change due to the added mass of saturated liquid water at \( T_{\text{in,12}} = 20^\circ\text{C} \).
