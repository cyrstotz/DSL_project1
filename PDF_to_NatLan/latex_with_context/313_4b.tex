The equations for stationary processes are written as follows:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a \right] + \sum Q - \sum W
\]
\[
W = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a \right]
\]  
Where:  
- \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate.  
- \( h_e \) and \( h_a \) are the specific enthalpies at the exit and inlet, respectively.  
- \( Q \) represents heat transfer.  
- \( W \) represents work.
