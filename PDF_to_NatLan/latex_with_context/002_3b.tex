The pressure of the gas remains constant:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The external pressure acting on the gas has not changed.  

The ice mass fraction in state 2 is greater than zero (\( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \)), meaning not all the ice has melted. Therefore, the temperatures of the gas and the ice-water mixture are equal in state 2:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},2} = T_{g,2}
\]  
The temperature in state 2 is:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]
