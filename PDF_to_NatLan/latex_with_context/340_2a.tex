The process is represented qualitatively in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars and key states of the jet engine process.  
- State 1: Inlet conditions.  
- State 2: Compression (adiabatic).  
- State 3: Combustion (isobaric).  
- State 4: Expansion in the turbine (adiabatic).  
- State 5: Mixing chamber.  
- State 6: Nozzle exit.  

The diagram shows increasing entropy (\( s \)) along the x-axis and temperature (\( T \)) along the y-axis. The compression and turbine processes are curved, indicating adiabatic changes, while the combustion process is horizontal, representing isobaric heat addition.
