A diagram is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) cycle. The axes are labeled as \( p \) in bar and \( T \) in Kelvin. The cycle consists of four states labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), and \( 4 \), connected by arrows indicating the process flow. The processes are described as follows:  
- \( 1 \to 2 \): Isentropic compression  
- \( 2 \to 3 \): Isentropic process  
- \( 3 \to 4 \): Isobaric process  
- \( 4 \to 1 \): Pressure reduction
