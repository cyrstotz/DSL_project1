Since no more heat is transferred, the gas and EW reach thermal equilibrium:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  

For \( x > 0 \), the equilibrium condition holds:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},1} = 0^\circ\text{C} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  

The pressure balance remains constant:  
\[
p_2 = p = 140089.4 \, \text{Pa}
\]
