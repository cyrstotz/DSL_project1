A graph is drawn with pressure \( P \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The diagram represents the freeze-drying process. Key features include:  
- A labeled region for "gas" at higher temperatures and lower pressures.  
- A point labeled "10 K" indicating a temperature difference.  
- A pressure of "3 mbar" marked near the sublimation region.  
- Phase regions are indicated, with arrows showing transitions between states.  
- The axes are labeled, and the phase boundaries are sketched qualitatively.
