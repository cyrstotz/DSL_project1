A graph is drawn with axes labeled \( p \) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \( T \) (temperature) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts a phase diagram with regions for different phases. A line labeled "4" is shown, representing isobaric evaporation at a temperature 6 K below \( T_i \). The diagram includes arrows indicating transitions between states, but some details are unclear.
