The energy balance (EB) for a piston system is derived from the general energy equation:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{Q}_j - \sum \dot{W}_n
\]  
For a steady-state process:  
\[
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = \sum Q_j - \sum W_n
\]  
Rewriting:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W_{12} \quad \Rightarrow \quad Q_{12} = E_2 - E_1 + W_{12}
\]  

The system boundary is defined as containing only the gas. A small sketch is provided showing a rectangular boundary labeled "Gas" with a membrane separating the system.

The gas pressure in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 49.56 \, \text{kPa} = 0.4956 \, \text{bar} \approx 0.5 \, \text{bar}
\]
