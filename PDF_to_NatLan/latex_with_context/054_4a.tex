A graph is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (\(p-T\)) diagram. The curve represents the freeze-drying process. Key points are labeled as \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), and \(4\).  
- **State 2**: The refrigerant is in the vapor phase.  
- **State 4**: The refrigerant is in the liquid phase.  
- \(p_1 = p_2\)  
- \(p_3 = p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar}\)
