A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled axes: pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) in Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The diagram depicts a cycle with four states labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- The transitions between states 1 and 2, and states 3 and 4, are marked as "isobar" (constant pressure).  
- The cycle forms a closed loop, indicating a thermodynamic process.  
- A smaller, unlabeled sketch of the cycle appears to the right of the main diagram.
