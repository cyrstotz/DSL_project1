The equation for the work rate \( \dot{W}_K \) is given as:  
\[
\dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{W}
\]  
The pressure at state 3 is \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \), and the enthalpy at state 2 is \( h_2 \). It is noted that \( s_2 = s_3 \) (isentropic process).  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} [h_2 - h_3] - \dot{W}_K \quad \Rightarrow \quad \dot{W}_K = \dot{m} [h_2 - h_3]
\]  
Rearranging for mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \):  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

The enthalpy \( h_2 \) is left undefined.
