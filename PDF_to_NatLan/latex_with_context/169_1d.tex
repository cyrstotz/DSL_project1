The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m}(h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{w}
\]  

The change in energy (\( \Delta E \)) is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta m_{12}(h_1 - h_2)
\]  

The internal energy change (\( \Delta U \)) is given by:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta U = U_2 - U_1
\]  

This leads to the expression for \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{U_2 - U_1}{h_1 - h_2} = \frac{C(T_2 - T_1)}{C(T_1 - T_2)} = \infty
\]
