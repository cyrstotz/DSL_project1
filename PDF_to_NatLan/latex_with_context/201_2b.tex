The task involves determining the outlet velocity \( w_6 \) and temperature \( T_6 \).  

The following equation is written:  
\[
w_6 = w_5 \cdot \frac{p_5}{p_0}
\]  
where \( \frac{p_5}{p_0} = 2.678 \).  

The corrected equation for \( w_6 \) is:  
\[
w_6 = w_5 \cdot \frac{p_5}{p_0} = 575.06 \, \text{m/s}
\]
