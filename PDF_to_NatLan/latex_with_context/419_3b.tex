The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \) is determined under equilibrium conditions. The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are calculated as follows:  

The ice fraction \( x_2 \) is given as \( x_2 = 0.2 \). The mass of the ice-water mixture \( m_{\text{EW}} \) is \( 0.1 \, \text{kg} \).  

The specific heat capacity of the gas is \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \). Using the transferred heat:  
\[
Q = m_{\text{gas}} \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

Rewriting the energy balance:  
\[
\frac{Q}{m_{\text{gas}} \cdot c_V} = T_2 - T_1
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_2 = T_1 + \frac{Q}{m_{\text{gas}} \cdot c_V}
\]  
\[
T_2 = 773.15 - \frac{0.002464}{3.42 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 0.633}
\]
