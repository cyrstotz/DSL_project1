An energy balance for the gas system (closed, isobaric) is applied:  
\[
\Delta U = m_g (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
The internal energy change is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U = m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1) + m_g \int p_g \, dv
\]  
The volume at state 2 is calculated:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m_g R T_2}{p_{g,2}} = 0.777 \, \text{L}
\]  
The heat transferred is:  
\[
Q_{12} = -7.507 \, \text{kJ}
\]
