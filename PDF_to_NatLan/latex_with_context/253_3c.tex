The first law of thermodynamics is applied to the gas system:  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
Substituting the internal energy change:  
\[
m_g c_V (T_{2g} - T_{1g}) = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
The work term \( W_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
W_{12} = \int p \, dV = R(T_{2g} - T_{1g}) = -83.14 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
Thus, the heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_{2g} - T_{1g}) - 83.14 \, \text{kJ} = -82 \, \text{kJ}
\]
