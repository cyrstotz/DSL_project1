A table is provided with labeled columns for temperature (\( T \)), pressure (\( p \)), specific volume (\( V \)), vapor quality (\( x \)), work (\( W \)), and entropy (\( S \)). The entries for the states are as follows:  
- State 1: \( T = 1 \, \text{[bar]} \), \( W = -28W \), \( x = 1 \), \( S = 0 \).  
- State 2: \( p = 8 \, \text{[bar]} \).  
- State 3: \( p = 8 \, \text{[bar]} \).  
- State 4: \( p = 0 \, \text{[bar]} \), \( x = 0 \).  

Additionally, the entropy change between states 2 and 3 is noted as:  
\[
S_{23} = 0 \quad (\text{adiabatic and reversible process}).
\]
