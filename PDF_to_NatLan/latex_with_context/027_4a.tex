A p-T diagram is drawn, showing the phase regions for gas, liquid, and solid. The triple point (TP) is labeled, and the diagram includes the following annotations:  
- "Gas" region is above the curve.  
- "Water curves back" is noted near the gas-liquid boundary.  
- "Solid" is labeled below the triple point.  
- "Isotherm under TP" is marked near the solid-liquid boundary.  
- "Isobar (freezer)" is drawn horizontally near the liquid-solid boundary.
