A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn, showing the thermodynamic process for the jet engine. The diagram includes labeled isobars and states:  
- State 1 is at the lowest temperature and entropy.  
- State 2 shows an increase in temperature and entropy due to compression.  
- State 3 represents the combustion process, with a significant increase in temperature.  
- State 4 shows a decrease in temperature and entropy due to expansion in the turbine.  
- States 5 and 6 represent mixing and nozzle exit, respectively, with entropy increasing slightly.  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis, in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- \( s \) (specific entropy) on the horizontal axis, in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \).
