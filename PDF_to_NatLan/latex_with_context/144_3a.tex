The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the cylinder is calculated using the formula:  
\[
A = \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2 \pi = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  
The gas pressure \( p_K \) is determined as:  
\[
p_K = \frac{m_K g}{A} = 39990 \, \text{Pa} = 33.99 \, \text{kPa}
\]  
The equilibrium pressure \( p_{\text{EW}} \) is approximately:  
\[
p_{\text{EW}} \approx 6.108 \, \text{kPa} \quad \text{(from Table A-6)}
\]  
The total gas pressure \( p_g \) is calculated as:  
\[
p_g + p_{\text{EW}} = p_K + p_{\text{amb}}
\]  
Rearranging gives:  
\[
p_g = p_K + p_{\text{amb}} - p_{\text{EW}} = 1.394 \, \text{bar}
\]
