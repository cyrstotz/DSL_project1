The temperature \( T_i = 10^\circ\text{C} \) and the pressure \( p_i = 2 \, \text{mbar} \).  

If the cooling cycle from Step i continues with constant \( \dot{Q}_K \), the temperature decreases continuously because \( \dot{Q}_K \) is applied and no additional work is performed.

Description of the diagram:  
The diagram shows the phase regions for gas, liquid, and solid. The sublimation curve is drawn, and the triple point is marked. The axes are labeled with pressure (\( p \)) in bar and temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin.
