The mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) of saturated liquid water added during cooling is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
\Delta U = \Delta m (h_1 - h_2) + Q_{12} - Q_{R,12}
\]  
Simplified:  
\[
\Delta U = \Delta m (h_1 - h_2)
\]  
Using the specific heat capacity \( c_p \):  
\[
m_1 T_2 c_p - m_1 T_1 c_p = \Delta m (h_1 - h_2) - T_2 c_p
\]  
Rearranging for \( \Delta m \):  
\[
\Delta m = \frac{m_1 T_2 c_p - m_1 T_1 c_p}{(h_1 - h_2) - T_2 c_p}
\]  
Values for \( h_1 \), \( h_2 \) are obtained from water tables (Table A-2). The result is described as "calculated with \( \Delta m \) given."
