The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = 0
\]  
This implies that the rate of change of energy in the system is zero. The equation is expanded to:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m} \cdot \left( h + \frac{v^2}{2} + gz \right) + \sum \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}
\]  
Here, kinetic and potential energy terms are neglected, as indicated by "O, Wasser macht keine U" (water does not contribute to kinetic energy).  

The mass-energy balance for the system is expressed as:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = \dot{Q}
\]  

The pressure in the ice-water mixture at state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
p_{\text{EW},2} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_K \cdot g}{A}
\]  
Substituting values, the pressure is:  
\[
p_{\text{EW},2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The enthalpy balance for the ice-water mixture is written as:  
\[
m \cdot \left( x_{\text{ice},2} \cdot u_{\text{ice},\text{fusion}} + (1 - x_{\text{ice},2}) \cdot u_{\text{water},\text{fusion}} \right) - m \cdot \left( x_{\text{ice},1} \cdot u_{\text{ice},\text{fusion}} + (1 - x_{\text{ice},1}) \cdot u_{\text{water},\text{fusion}} \right) = Q_{12}
\]  

This equation accounts for the change in ice fraction and the corresponding enthalpy changes during the phase transition.
