The enthalpy at state 4 is equal to the enthalpy at state 1:  
\[
h_4 = h_1 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The pressure at state 2 is equal to the pressure at state 1:  
\[
p_2 = p_1 = 1.2182 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{m_r - h_f(p_1)}{h_g(p_1) - h_f(p_1)}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
x_1 = 0.3375
\]

The pressure at state 4 is equal to the pressure at state 2:  
\[
p_4 = p_2
\]  

The vapor quality at state 4 is zero (\( x_4 = 0 \)), indicating that the refrigerant is fully condensed. The pressure at state 4 is given as:  
\[
p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The temperature at state 4 is approximately:  
\[
T_4 = 31 \, \text{to} \, 33^\circ\text{C}
\]
