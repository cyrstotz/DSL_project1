The following equation appears partially written:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot (s_5 - s_6) + \dot{Q} \cdot \frac{1}{T} - s_{\text{gen}} = 0
\]  
This equation seems to represent an entropy balance, but parts of it are crossed out.  

Another expression is partially visible:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot [h_5 - h_6 - T_0 \cdot (s_5 - s_0)] + k_e
\]  
This appears to be related to the calculation of flow exergy or energy balance, but it is incomplete.  

The variable \( k_e \) is written, but no further explanation or equation is provided for it.  

No additional explanation or context is visible for these equations.
