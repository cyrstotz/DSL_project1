The following calculations are related to the jet engine problem.  

The temperature ratio \( T_6 / T_5 \) is calculated using the pressure ratio \( p_6 / p_5 \) and the isentropic relation:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} T_5
\]  
Given \( T_5 = 328.07 \, \text{K} \), the equation is used to determine \( T_6 \).  

The work \( w_{5/6} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
w_{5/6} = R \frac{T_B - T_B}{-0.4}
\]  
The result is incomplete, but the work is approximately \( 78.71 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).
