The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and process paths:  
- State 1 to 2: Adiabatic compression, reversible.  
- State 2 to 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 3 to 4: Adiabatic expansion, irreversible.  
- State 4 to 5: Isobaric mixing.  
- State 5 to 6: Adiabatic expansion through the nozzle.  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis.  
- \( s \) (specific entropy, \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)) on the horizontal axis.  

Key points:  
- \( p_0 = p_6 = 0.1916 \, \text{bar} \).  
- \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).
