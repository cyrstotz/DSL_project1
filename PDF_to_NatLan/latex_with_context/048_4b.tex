The energy balance around the compressor is described. The equations provided are:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K = 0
\]
where:  
- \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is the mass flow rate of the refrigerant.  
- \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are the specific enthalpies at states 2 and 3, respectively.  
- \( \dot{W}_K \) is the work input to the compressor.  

The mass flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]

Another equation is given for the heat transfer rate:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{Q}_{\text{ab}} - \dot{W}_K
\]

Additional notes include:  
- \( p_3 = p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  
- \( h_4 = h_f \), where \( h_f \) is the enthalpy of the saturated liquid at state 4.  
- \( h_f = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).
