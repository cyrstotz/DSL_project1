A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled states \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The process transitions are marked, including compression, combustion, and expansion. Isobars are indicated, and the curve trends upward during compression and combustion, then downward during expansion.
