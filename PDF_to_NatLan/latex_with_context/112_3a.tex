The gas pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) in state 1 are determined using the following equations:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} \cdot V_{g,1}}{R \cdot T_{g,1}}, \quad R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g}
\]  
The balance equation for pressure is given as:  
\[
p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{m_K \cdot g}{A} + \frac{m_{\text{EW}} \cdot g}{A} = p_{g,1}
\]  
Where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder:  
\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2
\]
