A schematic diagram of a refrigeration cycle is shown. It includes three labeled states: \( 2 \), \( 3 \), and \( 1 \). Arrows indicate the flow direction, and a work input \( \dot{W}_K \) is shown entering the system.  

The equation for energy balance is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K
\]  
Rearranged, the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

Additional notes include:  
- \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are enthalpies at states 2 and 3, respectively.  
- \( h_3 \) corresponds to 8 bar pressure.  
- \( s_2 = s_3 \) (isentropic process).  
- \( s_3 \) is superheated, and \( s_3 \) at 8 bar can be found in Table 12.
