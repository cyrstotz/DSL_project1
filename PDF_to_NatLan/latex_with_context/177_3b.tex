To determine \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \):  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to \( T_{\text{EW,2}} \). Since there is still ice in the ice-water mixture, the temperature remains at \( T_{\text{EW,1}} \):  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

For the pressure \( p_{g,2} \), the following relationship is used:  
\[
\frac{p_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2}{T_2}
\]  
Rearranging for \( p_{g,2} \):  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 140094 \, \text{Pa} \cdot \frac{273.15 \, \text{K}}{773.15 \, \text{K}}
\]  

Calculating \( p_{g,2} \):  
\[
p_{g,2} = 0.495 \, \text{bar}
\]
