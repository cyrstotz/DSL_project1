The ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), meaning the water remains in the solid-liquid equilibrium region.  

The temperature of the gas will be \( 0^\circ\text{C} \). The gas transfers heat to the water as long as the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature of the water.  

The pressure of the gas will remain the same as in state 1. It must counteract both the gravitational forces and the atmospheric pressure.
