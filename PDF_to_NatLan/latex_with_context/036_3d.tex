The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\Phi = \Phi_e + x \cdot (\Phi_g - \Phi_f)
\]  

The temperature \( T_2 \) is given as \( 0.003^\circ\text{C} \).  

The ice fraction \( x \) is determined using:  
\[
x = \frac{U_2 - U_f}{U_g - U_f} = \frac{-0.033}{-333.492 - (-0.033)}
\]  

The mass fraction \( x \) is also expressed as:  
\[
x = \frac{m_F}{m_{\text{FL}} + m_{\text{rest}}}
\]  

Additional notes mention that values for state 2 need to be interpolated.
