The problem involves a stationary flow process. The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \left( h_e - h_a \right) - \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} + \dot{Q}_R
\]  

The enthalpy values are determined from the water tables:  
\[
h_e = h_f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.98 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
h_a = h_f(100^\circ\text{C}) = 419.04 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is calculated using:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \left( h_e - h_a \right) + \dot{Q}_R
\]  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} = 62.182 \, \text{kW}
\]
