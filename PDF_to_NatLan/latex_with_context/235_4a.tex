The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process.  
- The graph includes labeled phase regions with a triple point marked.  
- The process involves isobaric and isothermal transitions between states labeled as 1, 2, and 3.  
- State 1 is below the triple point, and the transitions are shown with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
