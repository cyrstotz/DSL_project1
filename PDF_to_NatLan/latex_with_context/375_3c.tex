The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is calculated as the difference between the heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) and the work done \( W \):  
\[
\Delta U = Q - W
\]  
The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Substituting the given values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 0.000003428 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot (0.0032 - 500^\circ\text{C})
\]  
This results in:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1.0848 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
Thus, \( 1.0848 \, \text{kJ} \) is released.
