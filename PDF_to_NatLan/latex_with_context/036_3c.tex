The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using:  
\[
Q = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot \Delta T.
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot \Delta T = 3.6 \cdot 0.633 \cdot (773.15 - 273.15) = 1139.393 \, \text{J}.
\]  

This heat transfer is negative, indicating heat is lost from the gas.
