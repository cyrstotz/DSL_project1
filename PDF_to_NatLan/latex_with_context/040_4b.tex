The equation for heat transfer is given as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
The evaporator temperature is defined as \( T_i \), and the heat transfer \( \dot{Q}_K \) is specified as \( -6 \, \text{K} \).  

The enthalpies are described as:  
\[
h_1 = h_f(-6 \, \text{K}), \quad h_2 = h_g(-6 \, \text{K})
\]
