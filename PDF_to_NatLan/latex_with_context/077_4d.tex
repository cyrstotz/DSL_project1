The entropy between states 2 and 3 remains constant:  
\[
s_2 = s_3
\]  
From the table:  
\[
s_3 = s_{3,f} = 0.3459 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

At \( x_2 = 1 \), the entropy values are:  
\[
s_{3,f} = s_{2,g} = s_2 = 0.3459 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

The pressure \( p_2 \) needs to be determined.

The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is given by:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]
