The energy balance for the process from state 5 to state 6 is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \left( h_5 - h_6 \right) + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} + \dot{Q}  
\]
This is simplified using the specific heat capacity \( c_p \) and temperature difference:  
\[
0 = m_f \left( c_p \left( T_5 - T_6 \right) \right) + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2}  
\]

For an ideal gas, the relationship between pressures and temperatures is given by:  
\[
\left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{k-1}{k}} = \frac{T_6}{T_5}  
\]
Rearranging for \( T_6 \):  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{k-1}{k}}  
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K}  
\]  

The equation also includes the kinetic energy term:  
\[
\frac{w_6^2}{2}  
\]  
but no further calculation is shown for this term.
