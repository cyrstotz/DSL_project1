The pressure at state 2 (\(p_2\)) is equal to the pressure at state 3 (\(p_3\)), which is given as:  
\[
p_3 = p_2 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i (h_i) + \sum \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}
\]  
Simplified for this case:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2) - \dot{W}
\]
