The equation for the stationary thermodynamic process is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_4 - h_5 - T_0 (s_4 - s_5) \right) + \frac{1}{2} \dot{m} \left( w_6^2 - w_5^2 \right) - \dot{W}_{\text{diss}}
\]  
Where:  
- \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate.  
- \( h_4 \) and \( h_5 \) are specific enthalpies at states 4 and 5, respectively.  
- \( T_0 \) is the ambient temperature.  
- \( s_4 \) and \( s_5 \) are specific entropies at states 4 and 5, respectively.  
- \( w_6 \) and \( w_5 \) are velocities at states 6 and 5, respectively.  
- \( \dot{W}_{\text{diss}} \) is the rate of dissipated work.
