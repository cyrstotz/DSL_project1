Using the first law of thermodynamics:  
\[
AU = PF - W_{12}
\]  

The temperature of the gas in state 2 is lower than \( T_{g,1} \) because heat is transferred to melt the ice. Consequently, the pressure also decreases.  

The direct heat transfer remains constant for \( m_{g,2} \), as the temperature adjusts accordingly.
