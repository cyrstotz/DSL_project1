The process is illustrated in a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram. The diagram shows the isobaric evaporation and condensation processes of the refrigerant, as well as the adiabatic compression and expansion. The phase regions are labeled, and the transitions between states are marked as follows:  
- \(p_1 \to p_2\): Isobaric evaporation  
- \(p_2 \to p_3\): Adiabatic compression  
- \(p_3 \to p_4\): Isobaric condensation  
- \(p_4 \to p_1\): Adiabatic expansion  

The graph includes the triple point of water, and the temperature \(T_i\) is determined from the graph.  
\[
T_i = -20^\circ\text{C}, \quad T_{\text{w}} = -26^\circ\text{C}
