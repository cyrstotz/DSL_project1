The vapor quality \( x_1 \) at state 1 is determined using the following relationships:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} (h_4 - h_1) + Q_{34}^{\text{adiabat}} - \dot{W}_{34}
\]  
where:  
- \( h_4 = h_s(8 \, \text{bar}) = 264.15 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  
- \( p_4 = p_3 \).  
- \( h_1 = h_f + x_1 (h_g - h_f) \), with \( h_g - h_f = x_1 (p_1) \).  

Additional notes:  
- \( h_4 \) is the enthalpy at state 4, and \( h_1 \) is the enthalpy at state 1.  
- The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the enthalpy difference \( h_g - h_f \).  

No additional diagrams or figures are described beyond the \(p\)-\(T\) graph in TASK 4a.
