The change in flow exergy is given as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_6 - ex_0
\]  

The exergy at state 6 is calculated as:  
\[
ex_6 = h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2}{2}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
w_6 = 510 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}, \quad T_0 = 243.15 \, \text{K}
\]  

At state 0, the exergy is:  
\[
ex_0 = \frac{w_0^2}{2}
\]  
All other terms are zero because \( h_0 = h_0 \) and \( s_0 = s_0 \) due to the reference temperature.  

The enthalpy difference is calculated as:  
\[
h_6 - h_0 = c_p (T_6 - T_0) = 85.134 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The entropy difference is:  
\[
s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) = 0.30196 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

Substituting these values:  
\[
ex_6 = 345 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
ex_0 = 20 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The change in flow exergy is:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = 325 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
