A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn, showing the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. The diagram includes labeled isobars \( p_0 \) and \( p_5 \), as well as states \( 0 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The process transitions are marked with arrows, and the entropy \( s \) increases along the x-axis while temperature \( T \) increases along the y-axis.
