The refrigerant temperature at state \(i\) is corrected:  
\[
T_i = -10^\circ\text{C}
\]  

No further explanation or calculations are provided for this subtask.

The calculation continues with the following expressions:  

The vapor quality \( x \) is determined using:  
\[
x = \frac{u_1 - u_f(-22^\circ \text{C})}{u_s(-22^\circ \text{C}) - u_f(-22^\circ \text{C})}
\]  
where \( u_1 = 82.70 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \), and values for \( u_f \) and \( u_s \) are taken from Table A-10. The result for \( x \) is:  
\[
x = 0.3682
\]
