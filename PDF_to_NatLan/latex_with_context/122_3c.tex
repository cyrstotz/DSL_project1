In state 2, there is no further heat exchange, and the ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \). Therefore, the temperature of the ice-water mixture remains constant at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The pressure does not change in the gas because the substances remain in equilibrium. The gas temperature adjusts to match the temperature of the water, as no heat exchange occurs in state 2.

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = \sum Q - \sum W = \Delta U + \Delta KE + \Delta PE = 0
\]  
The change in internal energy of the gas is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta U_g = c_V (T_2 - T_1) \cdot m_g = 1133.4 \, \text{J}
\]  
The work term is zero:  
\[
\sum W = 0
\]  
Thus, the heat transfer is:  
\[
\Delta U_g = \sum Q = Q_{12} = 1133.4 \, \text{J}
\]
