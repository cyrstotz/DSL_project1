1. **Graph Description**:  
   A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S [kJ/kg]". The graph appears to represent a thermodynamic process on a temperature-entropy (T-S) diagram.  
   - The curve starts at a low entropy and increases, forming a peak before descending.  
   - A straight line labeled "Isoline" intersects the curve at one point.  
   - The graph includes several points marked along the curve, indicating specific states in the process.  

2. **Equation and Explanation**:  
   The text explains that an energy balance is applied for a process with one mass stream:  
   \[
   Q = m \left[ h_a - h_e - T \cdot (s_e - s_a) + \Delta ke + \Delta pe \right]
   \]  
   Here, \( Q \) represents the heat transfer, \( m \) is the mass flow rate, \( h_a \) and \( h_e \) are enthalpies at different states, \( T \) is temperature, \( s_a \) and \( s_e \) are entropy values at different states, and \( \Delta ke \) and \( \Delta pe \) are changes in kinetic and potential energy, respectively.
