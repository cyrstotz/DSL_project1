The heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture between states 1 and 2 is calculated using:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_{g,1} - T_{g,2})
\]  
where \( c_V \) is the specific heat capacity at constant volume, \( T_{g,1} \) is the initial temperature of the gas, and \( T_{g,2} \) is the final temperature of the gas.
