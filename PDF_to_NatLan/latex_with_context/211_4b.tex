The system around the compressor is analyzed.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}
\]  
The mass flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

The process is labeled as adiabatic.  

Given values:  
\[
h_1 = h_4 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
\[
h_2 = 249.53 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
Temperatures:  
\[
T_i = 10^\circ\text{C} = 283.15 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
T_v = 4^\circ\text{C} = 277.15 \, \text{K}
\]
