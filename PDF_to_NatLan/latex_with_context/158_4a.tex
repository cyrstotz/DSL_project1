A graph is drawn representing the freeze-drying process on a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( p \) [bar] on the vertical axis.  
- \( T \) [K] on the horizontal axis.  

The graph includes the following features:  
- A curved line labeled "isobaric evaporation" connecting points 1 and 4.  
- Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked along the curve, with arrows indicating transitions between states.  
- The region labeled "Nassdampf Gebiet" (wet steam region) is shown.  
- Another region labeled "gesättigte Flüssigkeit" (saturated liquid) is indicated.
