The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin, while the horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \).  
- The process begins at state 1, moves to state 2, and follows a curve labeled "isobar \( p_0 \)."  
- State 2 transitions to state 3, which is marked higher on the \( T \)-\( s \) diagram.  
- The diagram includes curved lines representing isobars, with state points clearly labeled (1, 2, and 3).
