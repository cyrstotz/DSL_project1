The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T \) is calculated using the entropy balance:  
\[
T = \frac{\int_{s_e}^{s_a} T \, ds}{s_a - s_e}
\]  

Using the relation \( \frac{q}{T} = s \), this simplifies to:  
\[
T = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{s_a - s_e}
\]  

The entropy difference \( s_a - s_e \) is expressed as:  
\[
s_a - s_e = \int_{T_1}^{T_s} c_{\text{if}} \frac{1}{T} \, dT = c_{\text{if}} \ln \left( \frac{T_s}{T_1} \right)
\]  

Substituting this into the equation for \( T \):  
\[
T = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{c_{\text{if}} \ln \left( \frac{T_s}{T_1} \right)}
\]  

This provides the thermodynamic mean temperature based on the heat flow and temperature range.
