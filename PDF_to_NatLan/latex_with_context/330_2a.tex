The diagram represents a qualitative T-s diagram for the jet engine process. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is temperature \( T \) in Kelvin \([K]\).  
- The horizontal axis is entropy \( S \) in \([R_2/k]\).  

The diagram includes several isobars labeled \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_5 = p_4 \), and \( p_0 \). The process is drawn with orange curves and arrows, indicating the thermodynamic transitions between states:  
- State 0 to State 2: Compression.  
- State 2 to State 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 3 to State 4: Expansion in the turbine.  
- State 4 to State 5: Mixing.  
- State 5 to State 6: Isentropic nozzle expansion.
