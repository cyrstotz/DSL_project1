The pressure of the gas in state 1 is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{m_g R T_{g,1}}{V_{g,1}}
\]  
where \( R \) is the specific gas constant, \( T_{g,1} \) is the temperature of the gas in state 1, \( V_{g,1} \) is the volume of the gas, and \( m_g \) is the mass of the gas.
