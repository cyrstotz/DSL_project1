A graph is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram. The graph includes the following features:  
- The x-axis is labeled as \(T [K]\), representing temperature in Kelvin.  
- The y-axis is labeled as \(p [\text{bar}]\), representing pressure in bar.  
- Three distinct regions are marked: "Solid-Dampf" (solid-vapor), "Dampf" (vapor), and the "Triple Point," which is indicated as a specific point on the curve.  
- The curve transitions smoothly between the solid-vapor region and the vapor region, illustrating phase boundaries.
