The mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
ex_{\text{flow}} = (c_p(T_6 - T_0) - T_0(c_p \ln \frac{T_6}{T_0}) - R \ln \frac{p_6}{p_0}) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2}
\]  

Final expression:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = f(T_6, w_6, u_6)
\]
