A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) (in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The graph illustrates the freeze-drying process.  
- Point 1 represents "isobaric freezing."  
- Point 2 represents "isothermal pressure reduction."  
- Point 3 is connected back to Point 1, completing the cycle.
