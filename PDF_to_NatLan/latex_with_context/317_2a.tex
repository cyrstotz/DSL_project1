The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. It includes labeled states and process paths:  
- State 2 to 3 is marked as "isentrop" (isentropic compression).  
- State 3 to 5 is labeled "isobar" (isobaric heat addition).  
- State 5 to 6 is labeled "isentrop" (isentropic expansion).  
- The axes are labeled: \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis, with units \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).
