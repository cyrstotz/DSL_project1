The change in energy \( \frac{dE}{dt} \) is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{Q}_{\text{in}} + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} - \dot{W}
\]  

The total energy change \( \Delta E \) is given by:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta U - W
\]  

A sketch is provided showing energy flow and changes over time, with labeled terms such as \( \frac{dE}{dt} = \text{in} \), \( p_{g,12} - p_{\text{EW},12} \), and \( \Delta_{\text{ice}} \).  

The diagram illustrates energy transfer processes for the gas.

The pressure is constant, leading to the following relationship for temperature:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \left( \frac{V_{2,\text{ig}}}{V_{1,\text{ig}}} \right)
\]  

The specific volume of the gas is expressed as:  
\[
V_{2,\text{ig}} = -W_v + V_2
\]  
where \( W_v \) is the work done and \( V_2 \) is the final volume.  

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} (\ldots) + \dot{Q}_{12} - W_v
\]  

The change in internal energy is given by:  
\[
\Delta u_{\text{internal}} = Q_{12} - W_v
\]  

The entropy generation is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta s_{\text{gen}} = \dot{Q}_{12} - W_v
\]  

From this, \( W_v \) can be determined.
