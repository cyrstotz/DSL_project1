Using the first law of thermodynamics:  
\[
\Delta E_{\text{gas}} + \Delta E_{\text{EW}} = 0
\]  

This expands to:  
\[
m_g \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (u_1 - u_2)
\]  

Substituting for internal energy changes:  
\[
m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (u_1 - u_2)
\]  

The heat transferred \( Q \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot (0.003 - 500) = -31.651 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

This value is underlined in the solution.
