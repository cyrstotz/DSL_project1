The page begins with a graph labeled as a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram qualitatively represents the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. It includes labeled isobars and states:  
- State 5 (\( p_5 \)) and State 6 (\( p_6 \)) are marked.  
- The curve transitions from state 5 to state 6, showing heat transfer and entropy changes.  
- Axes are labeled: \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (specific entropy, \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)) on the horizontal axis.
