The following calculations are performed for the exergy balance around the turbine, assuming stationary operation and neglecting all irreversibilities in the turbine:  

The exergy change is given by:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = -\left[ h_0 - h_6 - T_0 \left( s_0 - s_6 \right) + \text{other terms} \right] + \frac{w_0^2 - w_6^2}{2}
\]  

Where:  
\[
\frac{w_0^2 - w_6^2}{2} = -100050 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The enthalpy difference is calculated as:  
\[
h_0 - h_6 = c_p \left( T_0 - T_6 \right) = -97.431 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The entropy difference is calculated as:  
\[
s_0 - s_6 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_0}{T_6} \right) = -0.53727 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

Substituting these values into the exergy change equation:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = -207.878 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Final result:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = 115.797 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
