The diagram is a pressure-enthalpy (\(p\)-\(h\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process with R134a. It shows four states connected by processes:  
- From state 1 to state 2, the process is isobaric.  
- From state 3 to state 4, the process is also isobaric.  
- The curve labeled "ND" represents the non-dimensional region, likely indicating a phase change or transition.  
- Arrows indicate the direction of the processes.
