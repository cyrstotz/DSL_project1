The final temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined as follows:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}}
\]  
This implies that the gas temperature in state 2 equals the equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture.  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{\text{EW}}
\]  
This indicates that the gas pressure in state 2 equals the pressure exerted by the ice-water mixture.  

Additional notes:  
The equation \( \dot{p} V = \dot{m} R T \) is written but not further elaborated.
