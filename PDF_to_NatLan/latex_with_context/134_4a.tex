The page contains several diagrams related to thermodynamic processes.  

1. **Diagram 1**: A pressure-volume (\(p\)-\(V\)) diagram is shown with a curve labeled "1" and "2". The curve starts at point 1 and transitions to point 2, indicating a thermodynamic process.  
2. **Diagram 2**: A temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(S\)) diagram is depicted with multiple points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4". The process transitions between these points, forming a closed loop. The arrows indicate the direction of the process.
