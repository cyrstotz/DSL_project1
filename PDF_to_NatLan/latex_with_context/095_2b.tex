Energy balance for the compressor:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_{\text{coolant}} \cdot (h_{\text{ein}} - h_{\text{aus}}) - \dot{W}_{\text{K}}
\]  
The mass flow rate of the coolant is given by:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{coolant}} = \frac{\dot{W}_{\text{K}}}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
Where:  
- \( h_2 \) is the enthalpy at state 2 (saturated vapor).  
- \( h_3 \) is the enthalpy at state 3.  

Additional notes:  
- Pressure interval is specified as 1 bar.  
- \( h_2 \) at 8 bar is referenced, and \( \Delta h \) is calculated.  
- \( h_3 \) is determined using data tables, yielding \( h_3 = 264.16 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  
- The enthalpy difference \( \Delta h \) is used for further calculations.

The outlet velocity is given as \( w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s} \), with \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  

The nozzle is modeled as adiabatic and reversible, implying \( s_5 = s_6 \). Using the ideal gas assumption:  
\[
\frac{p_6}{p_5} = \left( \frac{T_6}{T_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa}{\kappa - 1}} \implies T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \cdot \left( \frac{0.191 \, \text{bar}}{0.5 \, \text{bar}} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

A sketch of the nozzle process is drawn, showing the flow from state 5 to state 6.

The equation for energy conservation is written as:  
\[
\dot{m} \left( h_a + \frac{w_a^2}{2} \right) = \dot{m} \left( h_e + \frac{w_e^2}{2} \right)
\]  
Rearranging for \( h_a - h_e \):  
\[
h_a - h_e = \frac{w_e^2}{2} - \frac{w_a^2}{2}
\]  
The velocity difference is expressed as:  
\[
w_e^2 - 2(h_a - h_b) = w_0^2
\]  
From this, the velocity \( w_0 \) is derived:  
\[
w_0 = \sqrt{w_e^2 - 2(h_a - h_b)}
\]  
Substituting \( h_a - h_b \) with specific heat capacity \( c_p \) and temperature difference:  
\[
w_0 = \sqrt{w_e^2_{\text{eff}} - 2 c_p (T_0 - T_b)}
\]  
Numerical substitution:  
\[
w_0 = \sqrt{200^2 - 7.1 \cdot 10^2 \cdot (325.69 - 203.15)}
\]  
The calculated value for \( w_0 \) is:  
\[
w_0 = 109.07 \, \text{m/s}
\]
