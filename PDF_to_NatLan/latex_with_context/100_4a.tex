The table contains the following data for states 1 to 4:  
- **Pressure (\(p\))**:  
  - State 1: \( p = 1210 \, \text{mbar} \), \( p_1 = p_2 \)  
  - State 2: \( p = p_2 \)  
  - State 3: \( p = 8 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_3 = p_4 \)  
  - State 4: \( p = 8 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_4 = p_3 \)  

- **Temperature (\(T\))**:  
  - State 1: \( T_i = -6 \, \text{K} / (-22^\circ\text{C}) = 277.15 \, \text{K} \)  
  - State 2: \( T = T_2 \)  
  - State 3: \( T = T_3 \)  
  - State 4: \( T = T_4 \)  

- **Heat (\(Q\))**:  
  - State 2: \( Q = 28 \, \text{W} \)  

- **Work (\(W\))**:  
  - State 4: \( W = 0 \)  

- **Vapor quality (\(x\))**:  
  - State 1: \( x = 1 \)  
  - State 4: \( x = 0 \)  

Additional notes:  
- \( s_2 = s_5 \)  
- \( s_3 = s_5 \)

The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes the following features:  

- The curve represents the phase boundary between liquid and vapor.  
- Four states are labeled:  
  - State 1 is located in the vapor region.  
  - State 2 is on the phase boundary, indicating isobaric evaporation.  
  - State 3 is in the superheated region, showing the result of compression to 8 bar.  
  - State 4 is in the liquid region, representing condensation.  
- The critical temperature (\(T_{\text{crit}}\)) is marked at the peak of the curve.  
- The pressure at state 3 is labeled as "8 bar."  

The graph visually represents the refrigeration cycle of R134a during the freeze-drying process.
