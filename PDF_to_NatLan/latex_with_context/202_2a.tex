The process is illustrated on a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isotherms, isobars, and isentropes. The states are marked as follows:  
- \( 1 \to 2 \): Isentropic compression  
- \( 2 \to 3 \to 4 \to 5 \): Isobaric processes  
The curve transitions between these states, showing the thermodynamic paths.
