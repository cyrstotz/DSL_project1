The ideal gas law is used to determine the pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and mass \( m_g \) of the gas in state 1.  

The gas pressure is:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} = 1.4 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa}
\]  

The ideal gas law is expressed as:  
\[
p V = m R T
\]  
where \( R \) is the specific gas constant, \( T \) is the temperature, \( V \) is the volume, and \( m \) is the mass.  

The specific gas constant is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{R_u}{M_g} = \frac{8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}}{0.05 \, \text{kg/mol}} = 166.28 \, \text{J/kg·K}
\]  

The gas temperature is:  
\[
T_{g,1} = 773.15 \, \text{K}
\]  

The volume is converted to cubic meters:  
\[
V_{g,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L} = 3.14 \, \text{dm}^3 = 3.14 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3
\]  

The gas mass is calculated as:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p V}{R T} = \frac{1.4 \times 10^5 \cdot 3.14 \times 10^{-3}}{166.28 \cdot 773.15} = 0.0342 \, \text{kg}
\]

The equilibrium is maintained under incompressible conditions, and the forces remain constant.

The entropy change is calculated using:  
\[
b \cdot U_{\text{f,ice}} / 0.00328 = -333.4428 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The mass is calculated as:  
\[
b \cdot U_{\text{f,ice}} / 0.00328 = 0.033 \, \text{kg}
\]
