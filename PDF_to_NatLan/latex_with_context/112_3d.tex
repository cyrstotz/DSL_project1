The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) in state 2 is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_g - u_f}
\]  
Where:  
\[
u_2 = \text{specific internal energy at state 2}, \quad u_f = \text{specific internal energy of liquid water}, \quad u_g = \text{specific internal energy of ice}
\]  
Values for \( u_f \) and \( u_g \) are taken from the solid-liquid equilibrium table at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \):  
\[
u_f = (0.0033 \, \text{kJ/kg}), \quad u_g = (0.0033 \, \text{kJ/kg})
\]
