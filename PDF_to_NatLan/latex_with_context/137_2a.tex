A graph is drawn with temperature \( T \) (in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and entropy \( S \) (in \( \frac{\text{MJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \)) on the horizontal axis. The graph represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( S \) diagram for the jet engine process.  
- Three isobars are labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), and \( p_2 \), with \( p_2 > p_1 > p_0 \).  
- The process includes labeled points:  
  - Point \( O \) at the lowest entropy and temperature.  
  - Point \( B \) at higher entropy and temperature, connected to \( O \) via a curved line labeled "isentropic compression."  
  - Point \( C \) at even higher entropy and temperature, connected to \( B \) via a line labeled "isobaric combustion."  
  - A curved line connects \( C \) back to \( O \), labeled "irreversible expansion."  

Additional notes:  
- Air is modeled as an ideal gas, with the assumption \( \text{kein Nachkompf} \) (no condensation).  
- The process is stationary, and work \( W \) is generated.
