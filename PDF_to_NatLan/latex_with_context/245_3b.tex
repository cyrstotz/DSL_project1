The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) remains constant:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 140,089 \, \text{Pa}
\]  

The external pressure exerted on the gas must remain equal to the internal pressure, so the gas pressure does not change.  

The temperature of the gas in state 2 is:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

Since the ice-water mixture is still present, the temperature of the ice-water system does not change until all the ice has melted. Once the gas reaches equilibrium with the ice-water mixture, it also assumes the temperature of \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).
