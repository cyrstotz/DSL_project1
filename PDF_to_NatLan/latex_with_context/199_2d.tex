The mass-specific exergy destruction in the engine is calculated as follows:  

\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = -(ex_{\text{irr},6} - ex_{\text{irr},0}) - ex_{\text{irr},\text{mix}}
\]

Breaking this down:  

\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = -(ex_{\text{irr},6} - ex_{\text{irr},0}) + (1 - \frac{T_0}{T_B}) \cdot q_B
\]

Substituting values:  

\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = -120.8 \, \text{kJ/kg} + (1 - \frac{243.15 \, \text{K}}{1289 \, \text{K}) \cdot 1195 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

After calculations:  

\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = 845.38 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Additional notes: The term \( ex_{\text{irr},\text{mix}} \) accounts for mixing losses, and the calculation assumes all relevant values are consistent with the jet engine's operating conditions.
