The first law of thermodynamics for the gas is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U - Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1) + W_{v,1 \to 2}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
-0.80333 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The work done during the volume change is given by:  
\[
W_{v,1 \to 2} = m_g R T_2 \rho_3 \, \text{d}v - \rho_3 (V_2 - V_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
W_{v,1 \to 2} = -211.2 \, \text{J}
\]  

The heat transfer is then calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1015.2 \, \text{J}
\]  

The final volume \( V_2 \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m_g R T_2}{\rho_3}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
V_2 = 0.0011031 \, \text{m}^3 = 1.1032 \, \text{L}
\]
