The text begins with a description of an adiabatic process between states \(2\) and \(3\).  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
Q = m \cdot (h_e - h_a) + \frac{v^2}{2} + g \cdot z + \dot{Q} - W
\]  
where \(Q\) is the heat transfer, \(m\) is the mass, \(h_e\) and \(h_a\) are specific enthalpies, \(v\) is velocity, \(g\) is gravitational acceleration, \(z\) is height, \(\dot{Q}\) is heat flow rate, and \(W\) is work.  

The work equation is simplified as:  
\[
W = m \cdot (h_e - h_a) = m \cdot (h_2 - h_3)
\]  

The mass flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
m = \frac{W}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

The enthalpies \(h_2\) and \(h_3\) are left undefined, with placeholders:  
\[
h_2 = \quad h_3 =
\]
