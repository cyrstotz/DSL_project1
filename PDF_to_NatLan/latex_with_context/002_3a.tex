The initial conditions of the system are provided:  
- Gas temperature: \( T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Gas volume: \( V_{g,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L} \)  
- Specific heat capacity of the gas: \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)  
- Molar mass of the gas: \( M_g = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol} \)  
- Ice-water mixture mass: \( m_{\text{EW}} = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \)  
- Ice-water temperature: \( T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Ice mass fraction: \( x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.6 \)  

The pressure of the gas in state 1 is calculated using the formula:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{F}{A}
\]  
where:  
\[
A = \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^2 \pi
\]  
\[
F = (m_{\text{EW}} + m_K) g + p_{\text{amb}} A
\]  
The resulting pressure is:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The mass of the gas is determined using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,1} V_{g,1} = m R T_{g,1}
\]  
Rearranging for \( m \):  
\[
m = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}}
\]  
Substituting values yields:  
\[
m = 3.42 \, \text{g}
\]
