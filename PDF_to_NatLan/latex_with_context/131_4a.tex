A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn. The diagram includes the following features:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as \( p \) [Pa], and the horizontal axis is labeled as \( T \) [K].  
- A horizontal line is drawn at the triple point, labeled "Tripelpunkt." Below this line, the phase regions are labeled "solid" and "subsolid." Above the line, the phase regions are labeled "liquid" and "gas."  
- A process path is shown with numbered states (1, 2, 3).  
  - The path from state 1 to state 2 is labeled "isobar."  
  - The path from state 2 to state 3 is labeled "isotherm."
