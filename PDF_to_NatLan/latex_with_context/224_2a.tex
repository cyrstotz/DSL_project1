A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and key states (1 through 6).  
- State 1: Start of the process, marked as "isentrope."  
- State 2: Transition to an isobar.  
- State 3: Compression phase, labeled as "isobar."  
- State 4: Combustion phase, labeled as "isobar."  
- State 5: Mixing chamber, labeled as "isobar."  
- State 6: Nozzle exit, labeled as "isentrope."  

The axes are labeled:  
- \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis.  
- \( s \) (specific entropy, \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)) on the horizontal axis.
