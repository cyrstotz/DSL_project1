The energy balance equation for the refrigerant R134a is written as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_2 - h_1) + \dot{Q}_K = 0
\]  
Rearranging the equation gives:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = -\frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h_2 - h_1}
\]  
The temperature of the evaporator (\( T_v \)) is defined as:  
\[
T_v = T_i - 6 \, \text{K}
\]  

Additional crossed-out content includes an alternative energy balance equation:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_3 - h_2) + \dot{W}_K = 0
\]  
Rearranging gives:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
This part is crossed out and not considered further.
