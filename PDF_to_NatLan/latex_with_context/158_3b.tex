The ice fraction \( x \) must remain greater than zero to ensure equilibrium between the ice and water phases.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is given as \( 0.003^\circ\text{C} \), and the pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is constant at \( 140 \, \text{kPa} \). This pressure is sufficient to maintain the conditions for equilibrium.
