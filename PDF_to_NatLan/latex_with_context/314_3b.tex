In state 2, which is the equilibrium state, the gas and the ice-water mixture must have the same temperature:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C}
\]  
This ensures that no more heat is exchanged and the system remains constant.  

The pressure \( p_2 \) remains equal to \( p_{\text{amb}} \), as the external conditions do not change.
