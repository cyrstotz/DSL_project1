The process from state 2 to state 3 is described.  
- The work input to the compressor is \( \dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{W} \).  
- The pressure at state 3 is \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  

An energy balance equation is provided:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) + \dot{Q}_{2-3} + \dot{W}_K
\]  
Since the process is adiabatic (\( \dot{Q}_{2-3} = 0 \)), the equation simplifies to:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

State 3 properties are listed:  
- The refrigerant is in the liquid phase.  
- From Table A-10:  
  - \( T_3 = 35.38^\circ\text{C} \)  
  - \( h_3 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  
  - \( s_3 = 0.3459 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \)
