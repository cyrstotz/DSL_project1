The vapor quality \(x_1\) after the throttle is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{\Phi - \Phi_f}{\Phi_g - \Phi_f} \quad \text{with} \quad \Phi = v, u, h, s
\]  
The enthalpy after the throttle is stated as:  
\[
h = 243.78 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
It is noted that the throttle process is isenthalpic by definition.
