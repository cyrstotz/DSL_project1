No heat flows anymore once all the ice has melted. During this process, the pressure remains constant.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to the temperature of the ice-water mixture (EW):  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

The pressure of the gas remains constant:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 2.8 \, \text{bar}
\]
