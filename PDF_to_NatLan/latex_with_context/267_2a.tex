A graph is drawn showing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars for \( p = p_0 \), \( p = p_5 \), and \( p = p_2 \). The process is depicted with numbered states (1 through 6) connected by arrows. The bypass stream is indicated with a dashed line. The axes are labeled as \( T[\text{K}] \) for temperature and \( s[\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}] \) for entropy.
