The diagram represents a qualitative T-s diagram for the jet engine process. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis (in Kelvin), and the entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis (in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}} \)). The process includes labeled isobars and isentropic lines:  
- State 1 to 2: Isentropic compression.  
- State 2 to 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 3 to 4: Isentropic expansion.  
- State 4 to 5: Mixing process.  
- State 5 to 6: Isentropic expansion through the nozzle.  

Key points:  
- \( p_0 \) (ambient pressure) is labeled as "isobare."  
- \( p_2 \), \( p_3 = p_4 \), and \( p_5 \) are higher pressure levels.  
- The diagram visually shows the thermodynamic transitions between states.
