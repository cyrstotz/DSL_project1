A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The diagram represents the freeze-drying process. It includes labeled points:  
- Point 1: The starting state.  
- Point 2: Isobaric evaporation.  
- Point 3: Compression.  
- Point 3': Condensation.  
Arrows indicate the transitions between these states, and the process is described as isobaric and adiabatic in different regions.
