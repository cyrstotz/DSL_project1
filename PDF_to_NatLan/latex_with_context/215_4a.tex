The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes the following features:  
- A phase boundary separating the liquid ("flüssig") and gaseous ("gasförmig") regions.  
- Two labeled steps:  
  - Step (i): A horizontal line at constant pressure, representing isobaric evaporation.  
  - Step (ii): A vertical line at constant temperature, representing sublimation.  
- The pressure is reduced to 5 mbar below the triple point of water.  
- The temperature \( T_i \) is marked, and it is 10 K above the sublimation temperature.
