The ice fraction \( x \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x = \frac{u - u_f}{u_g - u_f}
\]

Since the membrane transfers heat, the equilibrium temperature of the gas and the ice-water mixture is:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0.003^\circ\text{C}
\]

The energy change is given by:  
\[
\Delta E = -Q_{12}
\]

The specific energy change per unit mass of the ice-water mixture is:  
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{m_{\text{EW}}} = u = -15 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

Substituting into the formula for \( x \):  
\[
x = \frac{75 - (-0.077)}{-333.442 + 0.023} = 0.0449
\]
