**Thermodynamic Mean Temperature:**  
The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is calculated as:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_{T_{\text{in}}}^{T_{\text{out}}} T \, dS}{S_{\text{out}} - S_{\text{in}}}
\]

The equation provided is:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_2 \cdot m_c \cdot (h_2 - h_5) - \dot{W}_K
\]  
This represents an energy balance equation, where:  
- \(\dot{m}_2\) is the mass flow rate,  
- \(m_c\) is a constant or specific mass,  
- \(h_2\) and \(h_5\) are specific enthalpies at states 2 and 5, respectively,  
- \(\dot{W}_K\) is the work rate of the compressor.
