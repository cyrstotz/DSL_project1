The following equations are written to calculate the transferred heat or related variables:

\[
63.53 = 79.82 \left(1 - x\right) + \frac{227.32 \, x}{241.24}
\]

\[
43.67 = 227.32 \, x
\]

Solving for \( x \), the result is:

\[
x = 0.1937
\]  

Note: Some intermediate steps or values are crossed out and therefore ignored.

The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated as follows:  

The specific heat capacity \( c_V \) of the gas is given as:  
\[
c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  

Since \( \Delta p = 0 \), the change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is equal to the heat transferred \( Q \):  
\[
\Delta U = Q
\]  

Using the formula:  
\[
m \cdot c_V \cdot \Delta T = Q_{12}
\]  

The temperature difference \( \Delta T \) is:  
\[
\Delta T = -500^\circ\text{C}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 1140 \, \text{J}
\]
