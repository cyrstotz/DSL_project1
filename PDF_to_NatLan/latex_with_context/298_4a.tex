A pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram is drawn to represent the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes the following features:  
- The x-axis is labeled as temperature \( T \) (Â°C), and the y-axis is labeled as pressure \( p \).  
- The diagram shows phase regions for solid, liquid, and gas.  
- A line labeled "Step i" indicates the isobaric evaporation process.  
- A point labeled \( T_i \) marks the temperature during the freeze-drying process.  
- A shaded region near the triple point is labeled "water can sublimate."  
- The triple point is clearly marked on the diagram.
