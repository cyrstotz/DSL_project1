The temperature \( T_2 \) is given as \( -22^\circ\text{C} \). The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is calculated as:
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{24 \, \text{kg}}{300 \, \text{s}} = 0.008 \, \text{kg/s}.
\]

The initial temperature \( T_i \) is \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), and the evaporation temperature is \( -6^\circ\text{C} \).
