A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) [K], and the horizontal axis is labeled \( s \) [kJ/kgÂ·K]. The diagram includes several labeled points and curves:  
- Points 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves.  
- The curve from point 0 to point 2 is labeled "drive line."  
- The curve from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "rotor."  
- The curve from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "rotor."  
- The curve from point 4 to point 5 is labeled "stator."  
- The curve from point 5 to point 6 is labeled "stator."  
The diagram visually represents the thermodynamic process in the jet engine, with isobars and qualitative transitions between states.
