The gas pressure in state 2 is equal to the ambient pressure:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{\text{amb}} = 1 \, \text{bar}
\]  
This is due to thermodynamic equilibrium, as the gas no longer exerts additional pressure.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is calculated using the polytropic relation:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \left( \frac{p_{g,2}}{p_{g,1}} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
Substituting \( T_{g,1} = 773.15 \, \text{K} \), \( p_{g,2} = 1 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_{g,1} = 9.40 \, \text{bar} \), and \( n = \frac{C_p}{C_v} \):  
\[
C_p = R + c_v = 0.17 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} + 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} = 0.80 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  
\[
n = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{0.80}{0.633} = 1.26
\]  
\[
T_{g,2} = 773.15 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{9.40} \right)^{\frac{1.26 - 1}{1.26}} = 446.13 \, \text{K}
\]
