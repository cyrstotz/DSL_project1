The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined as follows:  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to \( T_{\text{EW},2} \), as the system reaches thermal equilibrium. Thus:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 273.15 \, \text{K}
\]  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,2} = \frac{m_g R T_{g,2}}{V}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
p_{g,2} = \frac{3.42 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 166.28 \cdot 273.15}{3.14 \times 10^{-3}} = 48 \, \text{kPa} = 0.48 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The pressure is \( p_{g,2} = 0.48 \, \text{bar} \).
