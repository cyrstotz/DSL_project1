The pressure at state 3 is given as \( p_3 = p_2 = 8 \, \text{bar} \). Using the data from Table A-10 at \( -16^\circ\text{C} \), the specific enthalpy at state 3 is calculated:  
\[
u_3 = u_f + x_1(u_g - u_f) = 93.92 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + 0.308 \cdot (208.45 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - 93.92 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}})
\]  
This results in \( x_1 = 0.308 \), where \( x_1 \) is the vapor quality at state 1.
