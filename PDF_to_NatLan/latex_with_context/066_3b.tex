The ice mass fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \) in state 2.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined as follows:  
The gas pressure remains constant because the EW chamber is incompressible, and thus only the piston and atmospheric pressure determine \( p_{g,2} \).  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) adjusts to thermal equilibrium with the EW chamber.
