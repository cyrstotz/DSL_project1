Entropy balance for the reactor system is derived as follows:  

\[
\Delta S = \Delta m_{12} \cdot s_{\text{ein}} + \frac{Q_{R,12}}{T} + S_{\text{gen}}
\]

From Table A-2, the specific entropy value is:  
\[
s_{\text{ein}} (20^\circ\text{C}, x=0) = 0.2966 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]

Additional terms include the heat transfer \( Q_{R,12} \) and temperature \( T \), which are used to calculate the entropy change. \( S_{\text{gen}} \) represents the entropy generation term.  

No further calculations are provided for this task.
