The process is adiabatic; therefore, the polytropic relationship \( pV^n = \text{constant} \) applies. Using the ideal gas law \( pV = mRT \), it follows that if \( pV^n \) is constant, the process must also be isothermal.  

Thus, \( T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} \).  

\[
pV^n = mRT
\]  
\[
p_2 = \frac{mRT}{V^n} = \frac{3.1422 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 166.28}{3 \times 10^{-3}}
\]
