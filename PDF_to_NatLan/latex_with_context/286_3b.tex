The specific heat capacity at constant volume is given as \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \).  

The temperature \( T_2 \) is \( 0^\circ\text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \). The temperature of the water does not change until all the ice has melted.  

The energy change \( \Delta E \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta E = c_V \cdot m_g \cdot \Delta T
\]  
Substituting \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} = 0.633 \, \text{J/g·K} \), \( m_g = 3.42 \, \text{g} \), and \( \Delta T = 500 \, \text{K} \):  
\[
\Delta E = 0.633 \cdot 500 \cdot 3.42 = 1082.41 \, \text{J}
\]
