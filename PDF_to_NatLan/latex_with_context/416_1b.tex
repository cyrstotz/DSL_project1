The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is defined as:  
\[
T = \frac{T_{\text{abs,in}} - T_{\text{abs,out}}}{S_a - S_e}
\]  

The entropy difference is given by:  
\[
S_a - S_e = c_{\text{wm}} \ln \left( \frac{T_a}{T_c} \right)
\]  

The energy balance equation remains:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  

The temperature difference \( \Delta T \) is considered, and \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) is used to calculate the mean temperature.
