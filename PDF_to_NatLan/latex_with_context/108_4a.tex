A graph is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The graph includes a blue curve indicating phase boundaries. Four states (1, 2, 3, and 4) are labeled, forming a cycle. The pressure axis is labeled \( p \, [\text{bar}] \), and the temperature axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \). The pressure at state 3 is marked as \( 150 \, \text{bar} \), and the pressure at state 1 is marked as \( 1 \, \text{bar} \).
