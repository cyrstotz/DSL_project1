The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes the following labeled regions and points:  
- "Fest" (solid phase)  
- "Flüssig" (liquid phase)  
- "Gasförmig" (gaseous phase)  
- The "Triple" point, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist.  
- Two steps labeled as "i" and "ii" along the curve.  
- The curve is marked as "isotherm" (constant temperature) and "isobar" (constant pressure).  

The graph visually represents the transitions between phases during the freeze-drying process.
