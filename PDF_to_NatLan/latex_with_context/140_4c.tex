The entropy of the refrigerant at state \( u \) is equal to the entropy at state \( f \):  
\[
s_u = s_f
\]  
The entropy at \( s_u \) for a pressure of 8 bar is given as:  
\[
s_u (8 \, \text{bar}) = 0.9066 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  
The vapor quality \( x_u \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_u = \frac{s_u - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]  
Where \( s_f \) and \( s_g \) represent the entropy values for the saturated liquid and saturated vapor, respectively.
