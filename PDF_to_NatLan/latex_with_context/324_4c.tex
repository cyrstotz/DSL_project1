The equation for the enthalpy \( h_f(31.33) \) is given as:  
\[
h_f(31.33) = 91.45 + x \cdot \frac{1.33}{m^2}
\]

---

The throttle is described as isenthalpic and adiabatic:  
\[
h_4 = h_1
\]  
The temperature at state 4 is given as:  
\[
T_4 (8 \, \text{bar}, x = 0) = 31.33 \, \text{°C}
\]  
From the table, \( T_{\text{eb}} = -11 \, \text{°C} \).

Using the first law of thermodynamics for the throttle:  
\[
0 = \dot{Q} - \dot{W} + \dot{m}_R \left( h_4 - h_1 \right)
\]  
Since \( h_4 = h_1 \), no heat or work is exchanged.

For state 1:  
\[
x = 1, \quad T = 31.33 \, \text{°C}, \quad h_4 = h_f + x h_g
\]  
Values from the table:  
\[
h_f = 94.39, \quad h_g = 264.48
\]  
At \( T = 30 \, \text{°C} \):  
\[
h_f = 94.39, \quad h_g = 263.5
\]  
At \( T = 32 \, \text{°C} \):  
\[
h_f = 94.39, \quad h_g = 264.48
\]
