The pressure at state 1 is given as:  
\[
p_1 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The vapor quality at state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
x_1 = 0
\]  
The enthalpy at state 1 is equal to the enthalpy at state 4:  
\[
h_1 = h_4
\]  
The enthalpy difference is expressed as:  
\[
D = \dot{m}(h_4 - h_3)
\]  
Using values from Table A-10:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_4 - h_f(-22^\circ\text{C})}{h_g(-22^\circ\text{C}) - h_f(-22^\circ\text{C})}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{93.42 - 29.77}{234.08 - 29.77} = 0.337
\]
