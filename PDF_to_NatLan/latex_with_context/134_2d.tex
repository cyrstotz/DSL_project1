The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = \text{Enter Exergiebilanz}
\]  

The solution involves:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} + ex_{\text{adiabat}} - \dot{W}_e = ex_{XX,\text{verl}}
\]  

The equation is incomplete, and no further numerical values are provided.
