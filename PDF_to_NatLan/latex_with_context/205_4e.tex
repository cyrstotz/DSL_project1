The evolution of \( T_i \) in Step ii is described:  
If the cooling cycle from Step i continued with constant \( \dot{Q}_K \), \( T_i \) would decrease further below the triple point of water. This is because the sublimation process requires heat removal, and maintaining \( \dot{Q}_K \) would drive the temperature lower.
