The ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \) implies that the final temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and \( T_{\text{EW},2} \) must be \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

Thermal equilibrium is established:  
\[
Q = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

The pressure in the gas remains constant:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.400942 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Explanation: Since the ice fraction is greater than zero, the ice-water temperature remains constant at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \). Additionally, in state 2, no heat transfer occurs anymore, meaning the gas temperature must also be \( 0^\circ\text{C} \). The piston force remains constant, keeping the gas pressure unchanged.
