The diagram is a T-s (temperature-entropy) graph illustrating the thermodynamic process of a jet engine.  
- The x-axis represents entropy \( s \) in units of \( \frac{\Delta s}{c_p \cdot k} \).  
- The y-axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin.  
- The process begins at state \( 0 \) with \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The graph shows transitions through states \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), and \( 5 \), ending at state \( 6 \).  
- The pressure at state \( 5 \) is labeled as \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The curve includes isobaric and adiabatic sections, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
