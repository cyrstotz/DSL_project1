The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( S \) plot representing the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine.  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) [K] (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( S \) [kJ/K] (entropy in kilojoules per Kelvin).  
- The process begins at point 1 and follows an isentropic compression to point 2.  
- From point 2 to point 3, there is heat addition at constant pressure.  
- From point 3 to point 4, the process involves isentropic expansion.  
- From point 4 to point 5, there is heat rejection at constant pressure.  
- The nozzle process from point 5 to point 6 is labeled as "isentropic."
