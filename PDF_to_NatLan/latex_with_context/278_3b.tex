The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) and temperature \( T_{g,2} \) in state 2 are determined as follows:  

The system must remain in equilibrium with the surroundingsâ€”both in terms of pressure and gravitational force. Therefore:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.40 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the ice-water mixture. Since \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), the system must remain at the phase equilibrium temperature:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ \text{C}
\]  

Thus, the gas temperature is also \( 0^\circ \text{C} \).
