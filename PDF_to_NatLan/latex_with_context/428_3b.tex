In state 2, \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), meaning there is still ice present. The ice-water mixture remains at \( T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

Thus, \( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

Since the system with the piston remains unchanged, the pressure is constant:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}.
\]
