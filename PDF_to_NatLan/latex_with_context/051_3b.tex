As long as \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), ice is still present, and the temperature remains at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) because all the heat supplied is used for the phase transition from ice to water. No temperature change occurs during this process. Therefore, the temperature must remain at the melting point:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}.
\]

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) remains the same as in state 1:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.910 \, \text{bar}.
\]

This is because neither the external pressure nor the total mass (\( m_K + m_{\text{EW}} \)) changes.  

Final values:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C}, \quad p_{g,2} = 1.910 \, \text{bar}.
\]
