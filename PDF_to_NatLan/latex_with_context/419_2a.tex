The process is represented in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram shows the thermodynamic process of the jet engine, with labeled states 1 through 5. The following features are visible:  
- State 1 to 2: Isentropic compression.  
- State 2 to 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 3 to 4: Adiabatic expansion.  
- State 4 to 5: Isobaric mixing.  
The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis, with units \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \). The curves represent isobars \( p_2 = p_3 \) and \( p_4 = p_5 \).
