The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis (in Kelvin), and the entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis (in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)). The process includes labeled states:  
- State 0: Ambient conditions (\( p_0 = p_6 \)).  
- State 1: Pre-compressor (\( p_A \)).  
- State 2: Post-compressor (\( p_2 = p_3 \)).  
- State 3: Combustion chamber (\( p_2 = p_3 \)).  
- State 4: Post-turbine (\( p_4 \)).  
- State 5: Mixer (\( p_5 \)).  
- State 6: Nozzle exit (\( p_0 = p_6 \)).  

The diagram shows isobars for \( p_0 \), \( p_A \), \( p_2 = p_3 \), and \( p_5 \), with arrows indicating the direction of the process flow.
