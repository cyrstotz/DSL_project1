A diagram is drawn showing a temperature (\( T \)) versus entropy (\( S \)) graph. The graph includes phase regions labeled as "solid," "vapor," and "vapor-gas mixture." The curve represents the phase boundaries, with points \( z_1 \), \( z_2 \), \( z_3 \), and \( z_4 \) marked. The region between \( z_2 \) and \( z_3 \) is labeled "mass dampf gebiet" (mass vapor region). The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- \( S \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).
