The reactor mass at state 1 is \( m_{\text{total},1} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \) at \( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \) with steam quality \( x = 0.005 \).  

At \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \), the reactor mass at state 2 is given as \( m_{\text{total},2} = m_{\text{total},1} + \Delta m_{12} \).  

Using the energy balance:  
\[
m_{\text{total},2} U_2 - m_{\text{total},1} U_1 = \Delta m_{12} + Q_{\text{out},12}
\]  

The internal energy values are calculated as:  
\[
U_1 = 418.1 + 0.005 (2506.5 - 418.1) \quad \text{(from Table A-2, \( U_{\text{fld}} \) at \( 100^\circ\text{C} \))}
\]  
\[
U_2 = 252.85 + 0.005 (2466.6 - 252.85) \quad \text{(from Table A-2, \( U_{\text{fld}} \) at \( 70^\circ\text{C} \))}
\]  

Substituting into the energy balance equation:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = \frac{m_{\text{total},2}(U_2 - U_1) - Q_{\text{out},12}}{1 - U_2}
\]  

The result is:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = 2501.405 \, \text{kg}
\]
