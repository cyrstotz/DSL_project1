The energy balance equation for the entire turbine is written as:  
\[
Q_{\text{in}} = h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} + q_B
\]  
However, part of this equation is crossed out.

For the transition from State 5 to State 6 (adiabatic and reversible), the temperature \( T_6 \) is determined using the following relation:  
\[
\left( \frac{T_6}{T_5} \right) = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
where \( \kappa = 1.4 \).  

Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} = 328.1 \, \text{K}
\]  

Additional equations are partially visible but crossed out:  
- \( h_e - h_a = c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_a) \)  
- \( w_a = \sqrt{2 \left( h_e - h_a + q_B \right) + w_e^2} \)  
- \( q(T_e - T_a) \)  

These crossed-out sections are not transcribed further.
