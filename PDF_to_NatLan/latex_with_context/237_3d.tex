Continuation

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is equal to \( Q_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta U = Q_{12}
\]  
The internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = u_1 + \frac{Q_{12}}{m}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = -215.14 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Additional calculations:  
\[
Q_{12} = 1500 \, \text{J}
\]  
The equation for \( u_{T} \) is given as:  
\[
u_{T} = u_{0^\circ \text{C}} + k (u_{0^\circ \text{C}} - u_{T})
\]  
Where:  
\[
u_{0^\circ \text{C}} = -200.14 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
