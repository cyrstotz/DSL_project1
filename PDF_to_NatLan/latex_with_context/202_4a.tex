The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes two steps:  
- Step (i): Compression, labeled as "Komprimiert," showing an increase in pressure.  
- Step (ii): Isobaric evaporation, labeled as "isobare Verdampfung," showing a horizontal line at constant pressure.  
The axes are labeled:  
- \(p\) (pressure) on the vertical axis.  
- \(T\) (temperature) on the horizontal axis.
