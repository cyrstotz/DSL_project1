A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn. The graph shows temperature (\( T \)) on the vertical axis and entropy (\( s \)) on the horizontal axis. The process includes labeled points:  
- Point 1: Reversible  
- Point 2: Irreversible  
- Point 3: Isobaric  
- Point 4: Reversible  
- Point 5: Irreversible  

The diagram visually represents the thermodynamic processes described in the jet engine cycle.
