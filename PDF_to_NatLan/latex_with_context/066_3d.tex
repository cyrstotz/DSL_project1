No explicit calculation is provided for the final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \), but it is determined using the solid-liquid equilibrium table.  

**Figure Description:**  
The diagram shows a cylinder divided into two chambers. The lower chamber contains the gas, while the upper chamber contains the ice-water mixture. A piston rests on top of the ice-water mixture, exerting pressure downward. The atmospheric pressure and the piston weight contribute to the total pressure on the gas.

To determine the final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \), the energy balance is applied only to the ice-water mixture (EW) from state 1 to state 2.  

The equation is:  
\[
\Delta E_{\text{tot}} = \sum Q - \sum W = 0 \quad \text{(since the system is isolated)}
\]  

Using the mass and heat transfer relationships:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} \Delta u = Q_{12} \quad \text{with} \quad Q_{12} = 204.01 \, \text{kJ} \quad \text{and} \quad x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{m_{\text{ice}}}{m_{\text{EW}}}
\]  

Breaking this down:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} \Delta u = Q_{12}
\]  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{m_{\text{ice},1} - m_{\text{ice},2}}{m_{\text{EW}}}
\]  

Rearranging:  
\[
m_{\text{ice},2} = m_{\text{ice},1} - \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}} \Delta u}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{Q_{12} + m_{\text{EW}} \Delta u}{m_{\text{EW}}}
\]  

From the tables (TAB A):  
\[
u_f(0^\circ\text{C}) = -0.045 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
\[
u_{\text{fusion}}(0^\circ\text{C}) = -333.458 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Thus:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \ldots
\]
