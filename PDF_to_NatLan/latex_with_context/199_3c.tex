The system is described as a closed system with gas. The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W
\]  
The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Alternatively, using the specific heat capacity at constant volume \( c_V \), the equation becomes:  
\[
m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Substituting the given values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 3.479 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot (273.15 \, \text{K} - 773.15 \, \text{K})
\]  
The result is:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1082.77 \, \text{kJ}
\]
