The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph. It shows phase regions for gas, liquid, and solid (ice). The curve labeled "Fl√ºssig" represents the boundary between liquid and gas phases, while the curve labeled "Fest" represents the boundary between solid and liquid phases. The point labeled "1" indicates the initial state, and the point labeled "3" represents the state after compression. The process transitions are described as follows:  
- Isobaric freezing occurs first.  
- Sublimation follows, which is described as an isothermal process.
