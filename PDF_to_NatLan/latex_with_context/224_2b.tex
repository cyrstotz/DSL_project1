The equation for the outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is derived using the energy balance:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{w_5^2 + 2(h_5 - h_6)}
\]  
where \( h_5 \) and \( h_6 \) are the specific enthalpies at states 5 and 6, respectively.  

The molar mass \( M_L \) is given as:  
\[
M_L = 28.07 \, \text{g/mol}
\]  

The specific entropy at state 6 is equal to the specific entropy at state 5:  
\[
s_6 = s_5
\]  

Using the ideal gas relation and isentropic assumptions:  
\[
s_6 - s_5 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_5} \right) - \frac{R}{M_L} \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)
\]  

From the pressure ratio:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
where \( \kappa \) is the specific heat ratio.  

The temperature at state 6 is calculated as:  
\[
T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is determined as:  
\[
w_6 = 507.24 \, \text{m/s}
\]
