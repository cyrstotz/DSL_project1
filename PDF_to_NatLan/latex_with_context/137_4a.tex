The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process.  
- The process labeled "i)" is isobaric and occurs at a constant pressure.  
- The process labeled "ii)" involves a reduction in pressure, moving vertically downward on the graph.  
- The horizontal axis represents temperature (\(T\)) in Kelvin, and the vertical axis represents pressure (\(p\)) in bar.  
- The graph includes arrows indicating the direction of the processes.
