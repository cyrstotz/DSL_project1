A schematic diagram of a refrigeration cycle is drawn, showing three states (1, 2, and 3).  
- \( p_2 = 1 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \)  

The energy balance equation for the system is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_i \dot{m}_i \left( h_{\text{in},i} - h_{\text{out},i} \right) + \sum \dot{Q}_i - \sum \dot{W}_i
\]  
where \( h \) represents enthalpy, \( \dot{Q} \) is heat transfer, and \( \dot{W} \) is work.  

The work equation is given as:  
\[
\omega = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) - W_i
\]
