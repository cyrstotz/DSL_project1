The equation for the mass-specific increase in flow exergy is given as:  
\[
\dot{E}_{\text{exergy}} = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a - T_0 (s_e - s_a) \right]
\]  
Where:  
- \( \dot{E}_{\text{exergy}} \) is the exergy flow rate.  
- \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate.  
- \( h_e \) and \( h_a \) are the specific enthalpies at the exit and ambient conditions, respectively.  
- \( T_0 \) is the ambient temperature.  
- \( s_e \) and \( s_a \) are the specific entropies at the exit and ambient conditions, respectively.
