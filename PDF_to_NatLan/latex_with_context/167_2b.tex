The energy balance equation for the jet engine is written as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} \right) + Q - W
\]  
From this, the temperature at state \( T_2 \) is calculated using the isentropic relation:  
\[
T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
The ideal gas law is also noted:  
\[
p = \rho R T
\]
