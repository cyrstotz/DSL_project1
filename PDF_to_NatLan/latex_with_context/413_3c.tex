Energy balance for a closed system involving gas:  

The equation for heat transfer is given as:  
\[
Q = W_v + (U_2 - U_1) m_g
\]  

The work term \( W_v \) is calculated as:  
\[
W_v = R (T_2 - T_1) \quad \text{where } R = \frac{316.458 \, \text{J}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

The specific heat ratio \( h \) is determined as:  
\[
h = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = \frac{c_v + R}{c_v} = \frac{166.28 + 633}{633} = 1.2626
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q = 316.458 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}} + c_v (T_2 - T_1)
\]
