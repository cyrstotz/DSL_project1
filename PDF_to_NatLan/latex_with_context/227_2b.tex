The process from state \( 5 \) to state \( 6 \) is described as adiabatic and reversible, which implies it is isentropic.  

A table is provided with the following data:  
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{State} & P (\text{pressure}) & T (\text{temperature}) & W (\text{velocity}) \\
\hline
0 & 0.191 & 243.15 & 200 \\
1 & & & \\
2 & & & \\
3 & & & \\
4 & & & \\
5 & 0.5 & 431.9 & 220 \\
6 & 0.191 & & \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The efficiency of the compressor is noted as \( \eta_{1,5} < 1 \).
