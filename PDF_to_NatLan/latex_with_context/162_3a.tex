For a perfect gas, the mass \( M \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
M = \frac{\rho V}{RT}
\]  
Substituting the given values:  
\[
M = \frac{\rho V_{g,1}}{RT} = 3.42 \, \text{kg}
\]  
The gas constant \( R \) is determined as:  
\[
R = \frac{R_u}{M} = 0.166 \, \text{kJ/(kgÂ·K)}
\]  

The pressure exerted by the piston is calculated as:  
\[
F_g + p_{\text{amb}} A = p_g A
\]  
Where:  
\[
p_g = \frac{F_g}{A} + p_{\text{amb}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
F_g = 9.81 \cdot (m_K + m_{\text{EW}}) = 314.901 \, \text{N}
\]  
\[
A = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  
\[
p_g = \frac{314.901}{0.00785} + 1 \, \text{bar} = 1.46 \, \text{bar}
\]
