The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) plot illustrating the freeze-drying process. It consists of four distinct states labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), and \( 4 \).  
- Between states \( 1 \) and \( 2 \), the process is isobaric evaporation.  
- Between states \( 2 \) and \( 3 \), the process is a reversible adiabatic compression.  
- Between states \( 3 \) and \( 4 \), the process is isobaric condensation.  
- Between states \( 4 \) and \( 1 \), the process is an isenthalpic expansion.  
The graph includes annotations such as "geregelte vollständige Verdampfung" (controlled complete evaporation) and "geregelte vollständige Kondensation" (controlled complete condensation).
