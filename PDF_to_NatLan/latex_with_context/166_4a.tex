A graph is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The graph includes phase regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "gasförmig" (gaseous), and "flüssig" (liquid). The curve transitions between these phases, with points labeled \( T_i \) and \( p \).
