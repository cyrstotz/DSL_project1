The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \Delta E = \dot{m} \left( h + \frac{w^2}{2} \right) + \sum Q - \sum W
\]  
The ideal gas law is stated:  
\[
pV = mRT
\]  
The temperature at ambient conditions (\( T_0 \)) is expressed as:  
\[
T_0 = \frac{p_0 V_0}{m c_p R}
\]  

The mass flow rate is defined as:  
\[
M_c = m_s
\]  
The temperature at state \( s \) (\( T_s \)) is derived as:  
\[
T_s = \frac{p_c V_c}{R T_c} = \frac{p_s V_s}{R T_s} + \frac{p_0 V_0}{c_p R}
\]
