A graph is drawn representing the freeze-drying process on a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram.  
- The curve labeled "isobar" represents constant pressure.  
- The phase regions are marked as "Gas" and "Fl√ºssig" (Liquid).  
- The triple point (\(T_{\text{Triple}}\)) is indicated.  
- The process steps are labeled as follows:  
  - Step 1: Starting in the gas phase.  
  - Step 2: Moving isothermally towards the liquid phase.  
  - Step 3: Returning to the gas phase.
