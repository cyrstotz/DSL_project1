The temperature \( T_{g,12} \) is given as \( 0.003^\circ\text{C} \), the pressure \( p \) is \( 7.400 \, \text{bar} \), and the mass \( m_g \) is \( 3.427 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \).  

Using the first law of thermodynamics for the gas:  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = m_g Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
Kinetic and potential energy are neglected.  

The change in internal energy for the gas is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = c_V (T_2 - T_1) = -376.496 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
where \( c_V \) is the specific heat capacity of the gas.  

The total internal energy change is:  
\[
U_E = m_g \Delta U_{12} = 1.0824 \, \text{kJ} = Q_{12}
\]
