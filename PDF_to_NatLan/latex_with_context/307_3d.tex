The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = \sum Q_j - \sum W_{v,h}
\]  
This applies to the ice-water mixture (EW).  

The heat transfer is expressed as:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12} = 1500 \, \text{J}
\]  

Additional details are provided:  
- \( m_{\text{EW}} = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \)  
- The internal energy at state 2 is given by:  
\[
u_2 = u_f(T_{\text{EW},2}, p_{\text{EW},2}) + x_2 \left( u_g(T_{\text{EW},2}, p_{\text{EW},2}) - u_f \right)
\]  
- The internal energy at state 1 is given by:  
\[
u_1 = u_f(T_{\text{EW},1}, p_{\text{EW},1}) + x_1 \left( u_g(T_{\text{EW},1}, p_{\text{EW},1}) - u_f \right)
\]
