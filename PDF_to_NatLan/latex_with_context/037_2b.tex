The ambient temperature is given as \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} = 243.15 \, \text{K} \).  

The following equations and calculations are provided:  
1. The ideal gas law is used to determine the specific volume at ambient conditions:  
   \[
   p_0 V_0 = R T_0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad V_0 = \frac{R T_0}{p_0}
   \]  

2. The specific gas constant \( R \) is calculated using the relation:  
   \[
   R = c_p - c_v = c_p \cdot \frac{c_v}{c_p} - c_p \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = 0.287429 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
   \]  

3. The specific volume \( V_0 \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   V_0 = 3.65908 \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg}
   \]  

4. The temperature ratio \( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \) is derived using the polytropic relation:  
   \[
   \frac{T_6}{T_0} = \left( \frac{V_0}{V_6} \right)^{k-1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_6 = T_0 \cdot \left( \frac{R T_6}{p_6 V_0} \right)^{k-1}
   \]  

5. The final expression for \( T_6 \) is given as:  
   \[
   T_6 = \frac{R}{p_6 V_0} \cdot T_0^{k-1}
   \]  

Several intermediate steps and crossed-out calculations are visible but not transcribed as per instructions.

The temperature ratio is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa}}
\]  
This leads to:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa}} = 328.0747 \, \text{K}
\]  

The entropy at state 5 is equal to the entropy at state 6:  
\[
S_5 = S_6
\]  

The energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right] - \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}}
\]
