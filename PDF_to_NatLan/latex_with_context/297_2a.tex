The diagram is a T-s diagram (temperature vs. entropy) illustrating the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine. The following features are labeled:  
- Isobars (constant pressure lines) are shown, with one labeled as \( p_0 \) and another as \( p_5 \).  
- The process includes labeled states: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The transitions between states are described as follows:  
  - Between states 1 and 2: Isentropic compression (adiabatic and reversible).  
  - Between states 2 and 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
  - Between states 3 and 4: Adiabatic and irreversible expansion.  
  - Between states 5 and 6: Mixing and nozzle expansion.  
- The diagram includes arrows indicating the direction of the processes, and the entropy axis is labeled as \( s \, [\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}] \).
