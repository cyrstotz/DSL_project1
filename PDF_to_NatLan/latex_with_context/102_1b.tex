The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) of the coolant is calculated.  

### Coolant Properties  
The inlet and outlet temperatures of the coolant are:  
\[
T_{\text{KF,in}} = 288.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_{\text{KF,out}} = 298.15 \, \text{K}
\]  

Assuming the coolant behaves as an ideal liquid, the mean temperature is derived using the entropy relation:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int T \, ds}{s_a - s_e}
\]  

For an ideal liquid:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_{T_{\text{KF,in}}}^{T_{\text{KF,out}}} T \, dT}{T_{\text{KF,out}} - T_{\text{KF,in}}}
\]  

Substituting the values:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_{288.15}^{298.15} T \, dT}{298.15 - 288.15}
\]  

This integral simplifies to:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{1}{10} \cdot \int_{288.15}^{298.15} T \, dT
\]  

The result is the mean temperature of the coolant.
