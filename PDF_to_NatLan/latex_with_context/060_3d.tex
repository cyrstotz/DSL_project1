The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated using the following relationships:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.003
\]  
The specific internal energy values are given:  
\[
u_{\text{ice}} = -333.447 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad u_{\text{fusion}} = -0.033 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
The total internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
u_{\text{tot}} = u_f + x_{\text{ice}} \left( u_{\text{fusion}} - u_{\text{ice}} \right)
\]
