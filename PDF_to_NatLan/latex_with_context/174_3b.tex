The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) and temperature \( T_{g,2} \) are determined as follows:  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.401 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to the equilibrium temperature of the EW mixture:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

The ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \) indicates that the temperature of the EW mixture has not yet risen above the equilibrium point.
