The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gasförmig" (gaseous).  
- The curve separates the phase regions, with an isothermal line and an isobaric line marked.  
- Points labeled "1", "3", and "A" are shown on the graph, indicating specific states in the process.  
- The isothermal line connects points "1" and "3", while the isobaric line extends horizontally from point "A".
