Using the given values, further calculations are performed:  
\[
m_g = 3.6 \, \text{g}, \quad T_{2,g} = 0.003^\circ\text{C} = 273.153 \, \text{K}
\]  

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = \sum_j Q - \sum_n W_n
\]  

The heat transferred \( |Q_{12}| \) is calculated as:  
\[
|Q_{12}| = m_g (u_2 - u_1) = m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1) = 1139.4 \, \text{J}
\]
