The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents is calculated as follows:  
\[
S_1 = m_{\text{total},1} \cdot s(T_{\text{Reactor},1}) = 5755 \cdot 1.3069 = 7521.205 \, \text{kJ/K}.
\]  
\[
S_2 = (m_{\text{total},1} + \Delta m_{12}) \cdot s(T_{\text{Reactor},2}) = (5755 + 2355.16) \cdot 0.9549 = 8933.895 \, \text{kJ/K}.
\]  
The entropy change is:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = S_2 - S_1 = 8933.895 - 7521.205 = 1411.88 \, \text{kJ/K}.
\]
