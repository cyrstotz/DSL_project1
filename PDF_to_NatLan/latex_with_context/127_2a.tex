The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. It includes labeled isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_5 \), \( p_{213} \), and the states \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \). The process transitions are marked as isentropic and isobaric, with arrows indicating the direction of the thermodynamic transformations. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (specific entropy) on the horizontal axis.
