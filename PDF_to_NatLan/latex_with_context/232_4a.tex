The diagram shows a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph. The pressure (\(p\)) is plotted on the vertical axis, and the temperature (\(T\)) in Kelvin is plotted on the horizontal axis. The graph includes a dome-shaped curve representing phase regions, with a horizontal line drawn within the dome to indicate isobaric evaporation.
