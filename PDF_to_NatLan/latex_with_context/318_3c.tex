The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is given as \( 0.003^\circ\text{C} \).  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g (u_2 - u_1)
\]  
Expanding this, it becomes:  
\[
m_g (h_2 - h_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Or equivalently:  
\[
m_g (h_1 - h_2) = Q_{12}
\]  

Using the specific heat capacity \( c_p \), the equation is expressed as:  
\[
m \, c_p (T_2 - T_1) = -Q_{12}
\]  
The calculated heat transfer is:  
\[
|Q_{12}| = 1358.71 \, \text{J}
\]
