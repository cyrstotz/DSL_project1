The heat transferred between states 1 and 2 is denoted as \( Q_{12} \).  

Using the energy balance equation:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta U = Q_{12}
\]  

The change in internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = m_g (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  

For the gas, the internal energy change is calculated as:  
\[
m_g c_V (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) = Q_{12} = -1083.06 \, \text{J}
\]  

A note is written in the margin: "Energy balance of the entire system."
