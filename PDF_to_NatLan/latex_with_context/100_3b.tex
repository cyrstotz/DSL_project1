The system is isolated, meaning the volume does not change, and neither does the mass. Therefore:  
\[
Q = 0
\]  
The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
m_g \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (u_1 - u_2)
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
m_g \cdot (u_2 - u_1) + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (u_1 - u_2) = 0
\]
