The temperature of the EW in state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},2} = 0.003^\circ\text{C} = 273.153 \, \text{K}
\]  

The energy balance is applied:  
\[
dE = -Q_{12}
\]  
The change in internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = 316.435 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g (u_2 - u_1) = 1.083 \, \text{kJ}
\]
