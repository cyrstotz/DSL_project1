The entropy balance for the system, assuming steady-state operation and neglecting mass accumulation, is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{in}}(s_{\text{in}} - s_{\text{out}}) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{\bar{T}_{\text{KF}}} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  

The equation is simplified to show the relationship between mass flow rate, entropy change, and heat transfer.
