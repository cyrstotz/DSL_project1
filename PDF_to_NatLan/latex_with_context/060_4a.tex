A p-T diagram is drawn. The diagram shows pressure (\( p \)) on the vertical axis and temperature (\( T \)) on the horizontal axis. Four states are labeled:  
- State 1 is in the two-phase region, near the saturated liquid line.  
- State 2 is in the two-phase region, near the saturated vapor line.  
- State 3 is in the superheated vapor region, at higher pressure.  
- State 4 is in the subcooled liquid region, at the same pressure as state 3.  

The diagram qualitatively represents the refrigeration cycle with transitions between phase regions.
