The equation for the work done by the compressor is given as:  
\[
W_K = \dot{m}_R (h_2 - h_3)
\]  
Rearranging to solve for the refrigerant mass flow rate:  
\[
\dot{m}_R = \frac{W_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  

Entropy values are equated:  
\[
s_2 = s_3 = s(f, p)
\]  
The enthalpy at state 2 is expressed as:  
\[
h_2 = h_g(T_x)
\]  
The enthalpy at state 3 is determined via interpolation using the pressure \( s_3 \).
