The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the formula:  

\[
Q_{12} = c_V \cdot m_g \cdot \Delta T
\]

Where:  
\[
Q_{12} = c_V \cdot m_g \cdot (T_1 - T_2)
\]  

This represents the heat exchange between the gas and the ice-water mixture as the system reaches equilibrium.
