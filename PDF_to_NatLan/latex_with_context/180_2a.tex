The first diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \).  

The process includes the following states:  
1. Starting at state 1, the curve rises to state 2, representing compression.  
2. From state 2 to state 3, the curve moves horizontally, indicating isobaric heat addition.  
3. The curve drops from state 3 to state 4, representing adiabatic expansion.  
4. The process ends at state 5, with a slight rise in entropy.  

The diagram includes labeled isobars \( p_1 \), \( p_3 \), and \( p_5 \), which curve downward.
