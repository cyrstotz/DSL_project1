In equilibrium:  
The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is calculated as:  
\[
A = \pi r^2 = 7.85 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^2
\]  
where \( r = \frac{d}{2} \).  

The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is determined using:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_0 + \frac{m_K g}{A} + \frac{m_{\text{EW}} g}{A} = 1.48 \, \text{bar}
\]  

For a perfect gas:  
The equation of state is:  
\[
p V = m R T
\]  
The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{R_{\text{universal}}}{M} = \frac{8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}}{50 \, \text{kg/kmol}} = 166.28 \, \text{J/kg·K}
\]  

The gas mass \( m_g \) is determined as:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} = \frac{1.48 \, \text{bar} \cdot 3.14 \, \text{L}}{166.28 \, \text{J/kg·K} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K}} = 3.429 \, \text{kg}
\]

Water and ice are considered incompressible, meaning the volume of the ice-water mixture (EW) remains constant.  

The energy balance for the ice-water mixture is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q
\]  
where \( Q \) is the heat transferred.  

The temperature of the ice-water mixture (\( T_{\text{EW}} \)) is \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) and remains constant.  

The initial ice mass fraction is given as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.6
\]  
The water mass fraction is therefore:  
\[
x_{\text{water},1} = 1 - x_{\text{ice},1} = 0.4
\]
