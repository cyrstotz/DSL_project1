The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), as the ice-water mixture (EW) has a temperature of \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) and the gas and EW are in thermal equilibrium.  

Since the weight from above (piston, EW, atmospheric pressure) remains constant, the pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).
