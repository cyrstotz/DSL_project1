The final gas temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is given as:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0.008^\circ \text{C}.
\]

The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = -Q - W - \frac{dU}{dt}.
\]

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta U = -Q_{12} - W_v = m_g \cdot (u_2 - u_1),
\]
where \( W_v \) represents work done by the gas.

The specific internal energy \( u_2 - u_1 \) is calculated using:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_V \cdot (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}),
\]
where \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \), \( T_{g,1} = 773.15 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{g,2} = 273.153 \, \text{K} \).

Substituting:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = 0.633 \cdot (273.153 - 773.15) = -316.448 \, \text{kJ/kg}.
\]

The work \( W_v \) is expressed as:  
\[
W_v = -p_{\text{amb}} \cdot (V_{g,2} - V_{g,1}) - m_g \cdot g \cdot (z_2 - z_1),
\]
where \( z_2 - z_1 \) represents the height difference.

The volume \( V_{g,2} \) is calculated using:  
\[
p_{g,2} \cdot V_{g,2} = m_g \cdot R \cdot T_{g,2}.
\]

Substituting:  
\[
V_{g,2} = \frac{m_g \cdot R \cdot T_{g,2}}{p_{g,2}}.
\]

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta U = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]

Since the work term \( W_{12} \) is negligible, the internal energy change simplifies to:  
\[
\Delta U = m(u_2 - u_1)
\]

The specific internal energy difference is expressed as:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = i_f(T_2 - T_1)
\]
