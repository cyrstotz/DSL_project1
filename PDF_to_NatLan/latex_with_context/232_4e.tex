The text states that the temperature (\(T_i\)) would cool down faster ("würde schneller abkühlen") if the cooling cycle from Step i continued with constant heat removal (\(\dot{Q}_K\)).

Additional Formula:  
The vapor quality (\(x_1\)) at state 1 is calculated using:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{u_1 - u_{f,1}}{u_{g,1} - u_{f,1}}
\]
