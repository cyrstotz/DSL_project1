The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and key states:  
- State 0 represents ambient conditions.  
- States 1, 2, and 3 show the compression process.  
- State 4 represents the combustion chamber.  
- States 5 and 6 depict the turbine and nozzle processes.  
The isobars are labeled \( p_2 = p_3 \) and \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).
