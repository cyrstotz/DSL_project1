The mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is given as \( 6.62 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{h}} \).  
The temperature at state 2 is \( T_2 = -72^\circ\text{C} \).  
The enthalpy values are described as equal:  
\[
h_4 = h_1 \quad \text{and} \quad h_1 = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} = h_4
\]
