The coefficient of performance (\( \epsilon_K \)) is expressed as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{24}}{\dot{W}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{24}}{\dot{Q}_{2ab} + |\dot{Q}_{24}|} = \frac{28 \, \text{W}}{\dot{Q}_K - \dot{Q}_{ab}}
\]  
Additionally, the equation includes:  
\[
\frac{28 \, \text{W}}{(u_1 - u_2)(h_{fg} - h_1)}
\]  
(The equation is incomplete, and no numerical values are provided.)
