The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes labeled phase regions for solid, liquid, and gas. The process path is marked with states 1, 2, 3, and 4, showing transitions between phases. The refrigerant undergoes evaporation, compression, condensation, and expansion, forming a closed cycle. The sublimation region is clearly indicated.

The second diagram is another \(p\)-\(T\) diagram, focusing on the phase transitions. It highlights the sublimation process and the refrigerant cycle, with states labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. The diagram includes a shaded area representing the isobaric evaporation step.
