The gas pressure in state 2 is equal to the pressure in state 1:  
\[
p_{\text{g,2}} = p_{\text{g,1}}
\]  
This is because the pressure exerted by the piston remains constant.  

The heat transferred to the ice-water mixture is given by:  
\[
\Delta Q_{\text{gas}} = m_{\text{g}} \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]
