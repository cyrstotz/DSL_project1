A graph is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The diagram includes four labeled points (1, 2, 3, and 4) connected by lines to represent the freeze-drying process.  
- Point 1 is at the lower left, connected to point 4 by a vertical line.  
- Point 4 is connected to point 3 by a horizontal line.  
- Point 3 is connected to point 2 by a diagonal line sloping upward.  
- Point 2 is connected back to point 1 by a horizontal line.  

The axes are labeled:  
- \( p \) [Pa] on the vertical axis.  
- \( T \) [K] on the horizontal axis.
