The entropy change \( \Delta S \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated as follows:  

\[
\Delta S = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1
\]

Expanding the equation:  

\[
\Delta S = m_1 (s_2 - s_1) + \Delta m_{12} s_2
\]

The specific entropy values are obtained from Table A-2:  
For \( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \), \( s_f = 1.306 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}} \):  

\[
s_1 = \text{Tab A-2} \, (T = 100^\circ\text{C}, s_f) = 1.306 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}}
\]

For \( T = 20^\circ\text{C} \), \( s_f = 0.958 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}} \):  

\[
s_2 = \text{Tab A-2} \, (T = 20^\circ\text{C}, s_f) = 0.958 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg路K}}
\]

Finally, the entropy change is calculated:  

\[
\Delta S = 1411.88 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]
