The process is drawn qualitatively in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars and adiabatic curves. The states are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with arrows indicating the direction of the process. The curve between states 1 and 2 is labeled "isentropic," while the curve between states 5 and 6 is labeled "adiabatic." The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature) in Kelvin on the vertical axis.  
- \( s \) (specific entropy) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \) on the horizontal axis.
