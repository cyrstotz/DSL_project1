The entropy change is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = Q - W_v
\]  

The work done by the gas is expressed as:  
\[
W_v + m (\bar{u}_1 - \bar{u}_2) = Q
\]  

The work \( W_v \) is calculated separately, but the specific equation is incomplete on the page.  

No further numerical values or calculations are provided for \( W_v \).
