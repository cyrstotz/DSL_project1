The energy balance equation is:  
\[
U_{g,1} - U_{g,2} = U_{\text{EW,2}} - U_{\text{EW,1}}
\]  

It is stated that the gas temperature \( T_g \) and the EW temperature \( T_{\text{EW}} \) equalize. Therefore:  
\[
T_g = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  
This is because the temperature stabilizes in equilibrium.
