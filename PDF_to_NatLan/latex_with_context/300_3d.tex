The heat transferred between states 1 and 2 is given as:  
\[
Q_{12} = 1369.8 \, \text{J}
\]

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12}
\]  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12}
\]

The internal energy at state 2 (\(U_2\)) is expressed as:  
\[
U_2 = x_2 U_{\text{Fe}} + (1 - x_2) U_{\text{Fl}} \quad \text{(from Table 1)}
\]  
Where:  
\[
U_{\text{Fe}} = -333.458 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad U_{\text{Fl}} = -0.045 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The internal energy at state 1 (\(U_1\)) is expressed as:  
\[
U_1 = x_1 U_{\text{Fe}} + (1 - x_1) U_{\text{Fl}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
U_1 = -200.803 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad x_1 = 0.6
\]

The equation for \(x_2\) is derived as:  
\[
x_2 (U_{\text{Fe}} - U_{\text{Fl}}) + U_{\text{Fl}} - U_1 = Q_{12}
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{Q_{12} + U_1 - U_{\text{Fl}}}{U_{\text{Fe}} - U_{\text{Fl}}}
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
x_2 = 0.598
\]  

(Note: The final value of \(x_2\) is underlined and partially crossed out, but the calculation is complete and legible.)
