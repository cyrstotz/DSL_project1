The mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{dest}} = h_{6} - h_{0} - T_{0}(s_{6} - s_{0}) + \frac{1}{2}(w_{6}^2 - w_{0}^2)
\]  

Substituting the values:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{dest}} = 40.673 \, \text{kJ}  
\]  

Further calculations show:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = T_{0}(s_{6} - s_{0})  
\]  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = 732 \, \text{kJ}  
\]
