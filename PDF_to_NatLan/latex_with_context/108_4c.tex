The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is calculated using the following assumptions:  
The temperature at state 2 is \( T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C} \), and data is taken from Table A-10.  

The pressure at state 2 is \( p_2 = 1.292 \, \text{bar} \), and the pressure at state 4 is \( p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot (h_{u,4} - h_{u,1}) = 0 \implies h_{u,4} = h_{u,1}
\]  
where \( h_{u,4} \) and \( h_{u,1} \) are enthalpies.  

From Table A-10:  
\[
h_{u,4} = 93.62 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}, \quad h_{u,1} = 234.08 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x \) is calculated as:  
\[
x = \frac{h_{u,4} - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = 0.337
\]
