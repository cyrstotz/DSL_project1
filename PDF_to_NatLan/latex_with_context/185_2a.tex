The task involves drawing the process qualitatively in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram with labeled isobars and units on the axes.  

The diagram shows a temperature (\( T \)) versus entropy (\( s \)) plot. The process begins at \( T_0 \) and progresses through various states labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The following features are visible:  
- State 1 to 2 is marked as "isentropic compression."  
- State 2 to 3 is labeled "isobaric heat addition."  
- State 3 to 4 is marked as "isentropic expansion."  
- State 4 to 5 is labeled "mixing."  
- State 5 to 6 is marked as "isentropic expansion."  
- The isobars \( p_2 = p_3 \) and \( p_0 \) are clearly labeled.  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is \( s \) (entropy in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)).
