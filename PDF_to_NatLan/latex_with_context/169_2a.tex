A temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram is drawn. The vertical axis represents temperature in Kelvin (\( T [K] \)), ranging from \( 243.15 \, \text{K} \) to \( 431.9 \, \text{K} \). The horizontal axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).  
- The diagram includes labeled isobars:  
  - \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - \( p_0 = p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
- A reversible adiabatic (isentropic) process is indicated between states 5 and 6.  
- The curve transitions between states 5 and 6, with annotations showing the thermodynamic processes.
