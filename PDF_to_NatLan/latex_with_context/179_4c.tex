The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the following equations:  
\[
p_1 = p_2
\]
\[
p_1 = 1.272152 \, \text{bar} = p_m
\]
\[
p_m = -22^\circ\text{C} / 1.272152 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The throttling process is isenthalpic:  
\[
s_g - s_f = 0.345 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
The vapor quality \( x \) is determined as:  
\[
x = \frac{s_1 - s_f}{s_g - s_f} = 0.303
\]  
Where:  
\[
s_f = 0.0807 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}, \quad s_g = 0.9357 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]
