The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{R}{M_g} = 166.28 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

The pressure \( p_g \) is determined using the following equation:  
\[
p_g = \frac{m_{\text{EW}} g}{\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2} + \frac{m_K g}{\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2} + p_{\text{amb}} = 2.259 \, \text{bar}
\]  
where \( d = 0.1 \, \text{m} \).  

Using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p V = m R T
\]  
The temperature \( T_g \) is given as \( T_g = 773.15 \, \text{K} \), and the volume \( V_g \) is \( V_g = 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3 \).  

The mass of the gas \( m_g \) is calculated as:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_g V_g}{R T_g} = 5.52 \, \text{g}
\]
