The ideal gas law is applied:  
\[
pV = mRT
\]  
The total mass of the ice-water mixture is given as \( m_{\text{EW}} + m_{\text{ice}} = 0.16 \, \text{kg} \).  

The force balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Sigma F = 0
\]  
The pressure at state 1 is calculated using:  
\[
p_{g,1} A - 0.1 \, g - 32 \, g - p_{\text{amb}} A = 0
\]  
Rearranging for \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{(0.1 + 32) \, g}{A} + p_{\text{amb}}
\]  
The area \( A \) is calculated as:  
\[
A = \frac{\pi}{4} D^2 = \frac{\pi}{4} (0.1)^2 = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
p_{g,1} = \frac{(0.1 + 32) \, 9.81}{0.00785} + 1.10^5 = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{R_u}{M} = \frac{8314}{50} = 166.28
\]  

The gas mass \( m_{g,1} \) is determined using:  
\[
m_{g,1} = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
m_{g,1} = \frac{1.4 \cdot 10^5 \cdot 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3}}{166.28 \cdot 773} = 0.0034 \, \text{kg} = 3.4 \, \text{g}
\]

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
Q - W = \Delta U + \Delta KE + \Delta PE
\]  
Since kinetic and potential energy changes are negligible, the equation simplifies to:  
\[
Q_{12} = W_{12} + \Delta U_{12}
\]  
The change in internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = U_2 - U_1 = m_g (u_2 - u_1) = m_g \cdot c_V (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1})
\]  
Substituting the given values:  
\[
m_g = 3.6 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kg}, \quad c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}, \quad T_{g,2} = 0.003 \, \text{K}, \quad T_{g,1} = 500 \, \text{K}
\]  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = 3.6 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.633 \cdot (0.003 - 500)
\]  
\[
\Delta U_{12} = -1.14 \, \text{kJ}
\]
