The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and process states:  
- State 0: Ambient conditions (\( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} \)).  
- State 1: Adiabatic compression.  
- State 2: Adiabatic compression with isentropic efficiency \( \eta_{\text{comp}} < 1 \).  
- State 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 4: Adiabatic turbine expansion.  
- State 5: Mixing chamber.  
- State 6: Adiabatic nozzle expansion to ambient pressure (\( p_6 = p_0 \)).  

The diagram shows curved lines for isobars, with transitions between states marked by arrows. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature) in \( \, ^\circ\text{C} \) on the vertical axis.  
- \( s \) (entropy) in \( \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \) on the horizontal axis.
