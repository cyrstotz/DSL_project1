Given \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), the temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined.  

The following values are provided:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 1.56 \, \text{bar}
\]
\[
m_g = 3.6 \, \text{g} = 0.0036 \, \text{kg}
\]
\[
V_{g,2} = 0.00314 \, \text{m}^3
\]

Using the relation for temperature and pressure:  
\[
\frac{p_2 V_2}{R m_g} = T_2
\]

The temperature ratio is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^{\kappa - 1}
\]
Where \( \kappa \) is the adiabatic index.  

This simplifies to:  
\[
T_2 = T_1
\]

The pressure ratio is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)^{\frac{\kappa}{\kappa - 1}}
\]
This leads to:  
\[
p_2 = p_1
\]

Additional notes state:  
"Mass and volume remain constant, so \( V \) remains equal."
