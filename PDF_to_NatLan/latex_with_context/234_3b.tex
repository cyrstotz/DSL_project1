The temperature of the gas in state 2 (\( T_{g,2} \)) is equal to the temperature of the ice-water mixture in state 1 (\( T_{\text{EW},1} \)):  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},1} = 0^\circ \text{C}
\]  

Explanation:  
The ice-water mixture does not change its temperature due to the heat flow because it is already in the solid-liquid equilibrium region. This process is isothermal.  

In equilibrium, the gas and the ice-water mixture have the same temperature.  

A scribbled-out section appears below this explanation.  

The pressure in state 2 (\( p_{a2} \)) remains constant:  
\[
p_{a2} = p_{a1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Further explanation:  
The pressure remains unchanged because the force balance does not change, even though heat is transferred (refer to Task 2).
