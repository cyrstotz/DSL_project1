The pressure in state 2 is equal to the pressure exerted by the piston:  
\[
p_2 = p_z \quad \text{(as it is evenly distributed by the piston)}
\]  

The temperature in state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_2 = 0.003^\circ\text{C} \quad \text{(phase equilibrium)}
\]  

Converting to Kelvin:  
\[
T_2 = 273.18 \, \text{K}
\]  

The specific volume in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
V_2 = m_g V_1 \cdot \frac{R T_2}{p_2 m_g} = 0.00107076 \, \text{m}^3
\]
