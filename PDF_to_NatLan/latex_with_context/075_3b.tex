The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) must be close to \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) so that the ice-water mixture remains in phase equilibrium. At this temperature, the pressure must be near \( 1 \, \text{bar} \), as the system adjusts itself to thermodynamic equilibrium.  

\[
T_{g,2} \approx T_{\text{EW}} \, \text{in thermodynamic equilibrium}.
