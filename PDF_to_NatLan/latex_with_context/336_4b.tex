The equation for the rate of change of energy is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m} \cdot (h_{\text{in}} + v^2 + gz) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  
The energy balance is simplified as:  
\[
\sum E_{\text{in}} - \sum E_{\text{out}} = -Q_K - Q_{\text{ab}} = W_K = 28 \, \text{W}
\]  
The system is described as adiabatic.
