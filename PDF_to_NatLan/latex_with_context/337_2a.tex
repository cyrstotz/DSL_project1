The first part of the task involves drawing the process qualitatively in a T-s diagram. Two diagrams are provided:  

1. **Temperature vs. Entropy (T-s) Diagram**:  
   - The diagram shows labeled isobars and processes.  
   - States 1 through 6 are marked, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
   - The processes include isentropic compression, isobaric combustion, and adiabatic expansion.  
   - The entropy axis is labeled as \( S \, [\text{kJ}/\text{kg·K}] \), and the temperature axis is labeled as \( T \, [\text{K}] \).  

2. **Pressure vs. Entropy (p-s) Diagram**:  
   - The diagram shows the same states (1 through 6) with labeled processes.  
   - The pressure axis is labeled as \( P \, [\text{bar}] \), and the entropy axis is labeled as \( S \, [\text{kJ}/\text{kg·K}] \).  
   - Processes such as isentropic compression and isobaric combustion are indicated.  

Additionally, a table is provided summarizing the states:  
- **State Table**:  
  - \( P \): Pressure values at each state.  
  - \( T \): Temperature values at each state.  
  - \( V \): Velocity values at each state.  
  - \( w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s} \), \( S_5 = S_6 \).
