The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined for state 2.  

Given \( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \), the pressure is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p = \frac{mRT}{V}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
p_{g,2} = \frac{3.422 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 50 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 273.15}{3.14 \cdot 10^{-3}} = 0.495 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Since ice is still present, \( T_{\text{EW}} \) must remain at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \). Due to thermodynamic equilibrium, \( T_{g,2} \) and \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) must match, and the pressure is adjusted accordingly.
