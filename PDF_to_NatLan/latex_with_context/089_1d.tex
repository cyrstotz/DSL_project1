An energy balance is applied to the water system, considering the reactor contents:  

\[
m_{2} u_{2} - m_{1} u_{1} = \Delta m_{12} [h_{\text{in}}] + Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]

This equation represents the energy balance for the transition from state 1 to state 2, where \( \Delta m_{12} \) is the added mass of saturated liquid water, \( h_{\text{in}} \) is the specific enthalpy of the added water, \( Q_{12} \) is the heat released during cooling, and \( W_{12} \) is the work done.  

No further calculations or values are provided for \( u_d \).
