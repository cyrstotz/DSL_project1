The final equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{EW},2} \) is given as:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},2} = 0.003^\circ\text{C}
\]  
Using the first law of thermodynamics:  
\[
\Delta U = Q_{12}
\]  
The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
m_g (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
The internal energy difference is approximated using the heat capacity \( c_v \):  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_v (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Thus:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_v (T_2 - T_1) = -1.08 \, \text{kJ}
\]
