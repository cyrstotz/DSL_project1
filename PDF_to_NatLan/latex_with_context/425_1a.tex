The energy balance for the reactor wall is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_{\text{out}} - h_{\text{in}}) + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  
The heat flow removed by the coolant is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} c (T_{\text{out}} - T_{\text{in}})
\]  
Entropy change is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T}
\]
