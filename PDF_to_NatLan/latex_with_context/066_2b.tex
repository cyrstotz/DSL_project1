a) A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn.  
- The diagram shows temperature \( T \) on the vertical axis (in Kelvin) and entropy \( s \) on the horizontal axis (in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \)).  
- States 0 through 6 are labeled along the process curve.  
- The process includes compression, combustion, expansion, and mixing.  
- Isobars are indicated with dashed lines for \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) and \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).
