The pressure remains constant during the process:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.40 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The gas mass \( m_g \) also remains constant.  

The final temperature of the gas \( T_{g,2} \) must equal the equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

It is noted that the ice has not completely melted yet, and the system is still in thermal equilibrium.
