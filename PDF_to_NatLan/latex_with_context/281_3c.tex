Ice and water are incompressible. Therefore, the pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \), which is \( 1.5 \, \text{bar} \).

The heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the formula:  
\[
Q_{1,2} = |m_{g,1} \, c_V \, (\Delta T)|
\]  
Substituting the given values:  
\[
Q_{1,2} = 3.6 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.633 \cdot (500^\circ\text{C} - 0^\circ\text{C})
\]  
\[
Q_{1,2} = 1,139 \, \text{kJ}
\]
