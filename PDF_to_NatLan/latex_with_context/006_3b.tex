The pressures \( p_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,1} \) are equal because the load on the piston remains constant.  

Using the ideal gas law \( PV = mRT \):  
\[
V_{g,2} < V_{g,1} \quad \text{and} \quad T_{g,2} < T_{g,1}
\]  

It is stated that \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} \) because the gas is in thermal equilibrium with the ice-water mixture.  

The final pressure is:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.5 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The final temperature is:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]
