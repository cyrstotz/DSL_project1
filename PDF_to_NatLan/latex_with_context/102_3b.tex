The problem involves a perfect gas and the calculation of heat transfer. The following equation is used to describe the heat transfer:  
\[
\Delta Q = m \cdot c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
The specific heat capacity at constant pressure, \( c_p \), is defined as:  
\[
c_p = R + c_v = \frac{R}{M} + c_v
\]
