The specific heat capacity of the gas is calculated as:  
\[
c_{p,\text{gas}} = \frac{R}{M} + c_V = 799.28 \, \text{J/kgÂ·K}
\]

The heat transfer is determined using the enthalpy difference:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g (h_{2g} - h_{1g})
\]

Alternatively, using the temperature difference:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_{p,\text{gas}} (T_2 - T_1)
\]

Given:  
\[
T_2 - T_1 = 500 \, \text{K}
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g c_{p,\text{gas}} (T_2 - T_1) = 1366.77 \, \text{J}
\]
