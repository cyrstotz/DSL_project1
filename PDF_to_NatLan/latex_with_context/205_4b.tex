The rotational flow process is described as follows:  
\[
O = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1 + \frac{w_2^2}{2} - \frac{w_1^2}{2}) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  
For the transition from state 2 to state 3:  
\[
O = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_3)
\]  
The enthalpy \( h_2 \) is determined from tables (Table A-11) for \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  
\[
h_2 = h_f(p_3) = 93 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The sublimation point of water is determined as 5 mbar below the triple point. The initial temperature \( T_i \) is given as \( T_i = 10^\circ\text{C} \).  

The total temperature difference is calculated as:  
\[
T_{\text{total}} = T_i - T_{\text{triple}} = 10^\circ\text{C} - 0^\circ\text{C} = 10^\circ\text{C}
\]  

From the tables:  
- \( h_2 = h_g(10^\circ\text{C}) \) is found in Table A-10.  
- \( h_2 = 2337.94 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

The mass flow rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \dot{Q}_K / h_2 = 0.529 \, \text{kg/s}
\]
