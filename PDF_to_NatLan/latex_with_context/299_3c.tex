The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) between states 1 and 2 is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
Q_{12} = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_{\text{ext}}
\]  
Since \( \dot{Q}_{\text{ext}} = 0 \), this simplifies to:  
\[
Q_{12} = -\dot{m} (h_1 - h_2)
\]  
Using specific heat capacity \( c_p \), the expression becomes:  
\[
Q_{12} = c_p (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
The specific heat capacity \( c_p \) is calculated as:  
\[
c_p = \frac{R}{M} + c_V
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
c_p = \frac{8.314}{50} + 0.633 = 0.7992 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  
Finally, the heat transfer is calculated:  
\[
Q_{12} = c_p (T_2 - T_1) = 0.7992 (0.003^\circ\text{C} - 500^\circ\text{C}) = -399.6376 \, \text{W}
\]
