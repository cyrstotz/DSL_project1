The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and process states:  
- State 1 to 2: Compression  
- State 2 to 3: Isobaric heat addition  
- State 3 to 5: Expansion in the turbine  
- State 5 to 6: Mixing and nozzle expansion  
- \( P_0 \): Ambient pressure  
- \( P_3 \): High pressure after compression  
- \( P_5 \): Pressure after turbine expansion  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \).
