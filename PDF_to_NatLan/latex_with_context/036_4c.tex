The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
where \( h_1 \) is the specific enthalpy at state 1, \( h_f \) is the enthalpy of saturated liquid, and \( h_g \) is the enthalpy of saturated vapor.  

Additional equations provided:  
\[
\phi = \phi_f + x (\phi_g - \phi_f) \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{\phi - \phi_f}{\phi_g - \phi_f}
\]  

Given values:  
\[
h_2 = h_4 = 1342 \, \text{(from Table A-11)} \quad p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]
