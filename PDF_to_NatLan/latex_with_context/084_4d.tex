The coefficient of performance (\(\epsilon\)) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K} = \frac{\lvert \dot{Q}_K \rvert}{\lvert \dot{Q}_{ab} \rvert - \lvert \dot{Q}_K \rvert}
\]  
where \(\dot{Q}_K\) is the heat removed, \(\dot{W}_K\) is the work input, and \(\dot{Q}_{ab}\) is the heat absorbed.
