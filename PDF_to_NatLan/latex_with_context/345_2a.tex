The page contains calculations and a diagram related to Task 2, which involves the jet engine exergy problem.  

### Diagram Description:  
A graph is drawn with axes labeled \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (entropy). The graph qualitatively represents the thermodynamic process of the jet engine. The curve includes labeled points corresponding to states \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The process appears to include isentropic compression, heat addition, and expansion.
