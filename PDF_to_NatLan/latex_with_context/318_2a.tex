A graph is drawn representing a temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), representing temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( S \, \left[\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}\right] \), representing entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.  

The diagram includes the following features:  
- A curve starting at point \( 0 \), rising to point \( 3 \), and labeled as "isobar (geht durch 3)" (isobar passing through point 3).  
- A downward slope from point \( 3 \) to point \( 4 \).  
- A curve rising again from point \( 4 \) to point \( 5 \), labeled "isobar."  
- A vertical line from point \( 5 \) to point \( 6 \), labeled "isobar."
