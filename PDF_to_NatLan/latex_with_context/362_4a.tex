A pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram is drawn to represent the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes the following features:  
- The curve shows the phase boundaries between liquid, vapor, and saturated states.  
- State 1 is labeled as "liquid, \(x = 0\)" and lies on the saturated liquid line.  
- State 2 is labeled as "vapor" and lies on the saturated vapor line.  
- State 3 is located above the saturated vapor line, indicating a superheated vapor region.  
- Arrows indicate the transitions between states (1 → 2 → 3).
