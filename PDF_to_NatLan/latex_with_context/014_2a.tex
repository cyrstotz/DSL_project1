The diagram is a T-s (temperature-entropy) plot illustrating the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. The graph includes labeled points corresponding to different states in the engine cycle:  
- State 0 represents ambient conditions.  
- State 1 shows the pre-compression stage.  
- State 2 is the compressed air state.  
- State 3 represents the combustion chamber.  
- State 4 is the turbine outlet.  
- State 5 is the mixing chamber.  
- State 6 is the nozzle exit.  

The isobars \( p_0 \) and \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) are shown as dashed lines. The process transitions are marked with arrows, indicating compression, combustion, expansion, and mixing.
