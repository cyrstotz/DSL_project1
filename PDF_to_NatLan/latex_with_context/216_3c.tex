A closed system in a cylinder is analyzed with the assumption \( KE = 0 \) and \( PE = 0 \).  

The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \sum_j Q_j - \sum_j W_j = \xi Q_j - \xi W_j
\]  

The heat transfer is given by:  
\[
Q = m \cdot c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

The work done is calculated as:  
\[
W = \int_1^2 p \, dV = \frac{R(T_2 - T_1)}{1 - \kappa} \cdot m
\]  
Substituting values, \( W = 1.09 \, \text{kJ} \).  

The heat transferred to the water is:  
\[
Q_{\text{water}} = -Q_{\text{gas}}
\]  
\[
Q_{\text{water}} = -13.66 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

It is noted that \( T_1 = T_2 \) (from Table 1).
