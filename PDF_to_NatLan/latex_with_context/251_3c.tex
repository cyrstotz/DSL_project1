The energy change \( \Delta E \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} = m_g \cdot (\Delta u) = m_g \cdot c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_1).
\]  

The internal energy change \( \Delta u \) is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta u = c_p \cdot (\Delta T).
\]  

The specific heat capacity \( c_p \) is calculated as:  
\[
c_p = R + c_V = 0.7553 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}.
\]  

The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) is:  
\[
Q_{12} = 2.225 \, \text{kJ}.
\]
