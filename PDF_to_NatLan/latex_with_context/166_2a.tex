A diagram is drawn representing a thermodynamic process in a jet engine on a \( T \)-\( s \) (temperature-entropy) diagram. The diagram includes labeled states: \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). Isobars \( p_0 \) and \( p_5 \) are indicated, with arrows showing the progression of the process. The curve transitions from state \( 1 \) to \( 6 \), with state \( 5 \) marked as the mixing chamber.
