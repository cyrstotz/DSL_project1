The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_i \dot{m}_i \left( h_i + \frac{v_i^2}{2} + g z_i \right) + \sum_j \dot{Q}_j - \sum_n \dot{W}_n
\]  
Simplified further:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m}_i \left( h_e - h_a \right) + \dot{Q}_K - \dot{W}_K
\]  
The change in energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta U + \Delta KE + \Delta PE
\]  

The work and heat transfer relationship is given as:  
\[
\dot{W}_K - \dot{Q}_K = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left( h_e - h_a \right)
\]  
It is noted that \( \dot{W}_K = 26 \, \text{W} \) (from the task).
