A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram (temperature vs. entropy). The curve starts at a low entropy value and increases steeply, then transitions into a more gradual slope. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( s \) (entropy) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \) on the horizontal axis.  
- \( T \) (temperature) in \( \text{K} \) on the vertical axis.
