The ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \).  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined as follows:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]

This is because the water is incompressible, and the melting ice leads to no change in volume. Thus, the EW system is isochoric, and the equation from part (a) remains valid for part (b).  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is calculated using the polytropic process relation:  
\[
\frac{T_{g,2}}{T_{g,1}} = \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{n-1}
\]

Rewriting:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \cdot \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{n-1}
\]

The pressure-volume relationship is given by:  
\[
p_{g,2} V_{g,2} = m_g R T_{g,2}
\]

Rearranging for \( V_{g,2} \):  
\[
V_{g,2} = \frac{m_g R T_{g,2}}{p_{g,2}}
\]

From (1) to (2):  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \cdot \frac{M_g R T_{g,2}}{p_{g,2} V_{g,1}}
\]  

The equations are set up for further calculation.
