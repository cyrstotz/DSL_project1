The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. It shows the following labeled states:  
- \( 0 \): Ambient conditions  
- \( 1 \): Pre-compressor  
- \( 2 \): Post-compressor  
- \( 3 \): Combustion chamber  
- \( 4 \): Post-turbine  
- \( 5 \): Mixing chamber  
- \( 6 \): Nozzle exit  

The diagram includes isobars for \( p_0 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \). The process paths are drawn with arrows indicating the direction of the thermodynamic processes.
