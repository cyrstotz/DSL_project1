The transition from state 5 to state 6 is described as isentropic. The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

An energy balance equation is provided:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_6 - h_5) + \dot{m} \frac{w_6^2 - w_5^2}{2} + Q^{\prime\prime} - W^{\prime\prime}
\]  
Rearranging terms:  
\[
2 (h_6 - h_5) = w_5^2 - w_6^2 \quad \rightarrow \quad w_6^2 - w_5^2 = 2 (h_6 - h_5)
\]  

This equation relates the enthalpy difference between states 5 and 6 to the velocity difference.
