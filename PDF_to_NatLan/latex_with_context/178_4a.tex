The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It shows a closed loop with four states labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- The x-axis represents temperature (\(T\)) in Kelvin.  
- The y-axis represents pressure (\(p\)) in bar.  
- The curve includes phase regions, with the process moving through states 1 to 4 in a cycle.  
- State 1 is in the low-pressure region, while state 3 is at higher pressure.  
- The transitions between states are connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process.
