The diagram represents a qualitative T-s diagram for the jet engine process. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis, and entropy \( S \) (in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)) is plotted on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process points:  
- Point 0: Ambient conditions.  
- Point 2: After the adiabatic compression.  
- Point 3: Isobaric combustion.  
- Point 5: Mixing chamber.  
- Point 6: Nozzle exit.  
The processes are marked as "adiabatic" and "isobaric" where applicable.
