The ice-water mixture remains in thermodynamic equilibrium at the solid-liquid phase boundary until all the ice (solid phase) has melted. Therefore, the ice-water mixture (EW) is still at \( T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \). Consequently, the gas must also be at \( T_{\text{g},2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \) to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium.  

\[
T_{\text{g},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]

The masses that exert pressure on the gas remain constant. Thus, the gas pressure is calculated as:  
\[
p_{\text{g},2} = \frac{m_K}{V_{\text{g},2}}
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
p_{\text{g},2} = 1.46 \, \text{bar}
\]
