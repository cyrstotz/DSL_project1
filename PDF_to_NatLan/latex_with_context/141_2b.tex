To determine the outlet velocity \( w_6 \) and temperature \( T_6 \):  

Given data:  
- Ambient pressure \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  

The student mentions "balance in the boundary" and writes a crossed-out equation involving mass flow rates.  

Assumptions:  
- \( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} = \dot{m}_{\text{out}} \) (mass conservation).  
- \( p \cdot V^n = \text{constant} \) (likely referring to a polytropic process).  

No further calculations or results are visible.

Description of crossed-out content:  
The student attempted to write an equation involving \( \dot{m} \) and \( h_{\text{in}} \), but it was crossed out and not completed.
