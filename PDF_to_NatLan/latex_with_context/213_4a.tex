The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph showing the freeze-drying process. It includes labeled phase regions: "Solid I" and "Fluid". The curve represents the phase boundary between solid and fluid. The process steps are marked as follows:  
- Point 1: Isobaric evaporation.  
- Point 2: Reversible adiabatic compression.  
- Point 3: Isobaric condensation.  

The temperature axis (\( T \)) is labeled in Kelvin, and the pressure axis (\( p \)) is labeled in unspecified units. A horizontal scale indicates a temperature difference of 10 K.
