The pressure of the gas in state 2 is equal to the pressure in state 1:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]  
Since solid and liquid water are incompressible, a change in the ice mass fraction \( x_{\text{ice}} \) has no influence on the pressure \( p_g \). Therefore, the same approach as in part (a) can be used.  

The temperature of the gas in state 2 is equal to the temperature in state 1:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{g,1}
\]  
This is because, for ideal gases, temperature and pressure are coupled.
