The condition \(T_1 < T_i\) is stated.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] + \dot{W}_K
\]

The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = \frac{-\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_5 - h_2}
\]

The entropy condition is given as:  
\[
s_3 = s_2 \quad (\text{reversible adiabatic + isentropic})
\]
