Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) plot with shaded regions. The axes are labeled \(p\) (pressure) and \(T\) (temperature). The shaded region represents the phase change area.  
2. The second diagram is also a \(p\)-\(T\) plot, showing the phase regions labeled "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), "Gas" (gas), and "Nass-Dampf" (wet steam). Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked on the diagram, representing different states in the cycle.
