The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process in a temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(S\)) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature (\(T\)) in Kelvin (\([K]\)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy (\(S\)) in \([kJ/kgÂ·K]\).  

The diagram includes the following features:  
- Several isobaric lines are drawn, labeled as "isobar" and corresponding to different pressures.  
- An adiabatic line labeled "adiabat" is shown.  
- The states of the jet engine process are marked as points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The pressure values \(p_2 = p_3\), \(p_0 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}\), and \(p_0 = 6.193 \, \text{bar}\) are indicated near the isobaric lines.
