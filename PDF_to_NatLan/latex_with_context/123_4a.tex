The diagram shows the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The phase regions are labeled as "Fl√ºssig-Dampfgebiet" (liquid-vapor region). The process steps are marked as follows:  
- State 1 to State 2: Isobaric evaporation.  
- State 2 to State 3: Adiabatic compression.  
- State 3 to State 4: Isobaric condensation.  
- State 4 to State 1: Adiabatic expansion.  

The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis and \( p \) (pressure) on the vertical axis.
