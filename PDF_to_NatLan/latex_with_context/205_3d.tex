The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is determined using the solid-liquid equilibrium table.  

Additional notes:  
- \( Q_{12} \) is proportional to \( \ln \left( \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_{\text{avg}}} \right) \).  
- The temperature \( T_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
T_2 = T_1 + Q_{12} / m \cdot c_V  
\]

From the equilibrium table, the final temperature \( T_2 \) is \( T_2 = T_{\text{ice}} = 0.003 \, ^\circ\text{C} = 273.153 \, \text{K} \).  

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
\Delta E = W_{12}
\]  

The heat transfer equation is:  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) + W_{12}
\]  

Using the equilibrium table for ice-water mixture:  
\[
Q_{12} = 15003 \, \text{J}
\]  

The final ice fraction is calculated as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.045
\]
