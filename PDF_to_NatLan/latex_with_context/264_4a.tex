A graph is drawn with pressure \( P \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The graph represents a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram for the freeze-drying process. Key points and processes are labeled:  
- Point 4: "mass dampf" (mass vapor)  
- Point 3: "isobar Kondensort" (isobaric condensation)  
- Point 2: "adiabatic und reversibel (isentrop) Verdichtung" (adiabatic and reversible (isentropic) compression)  
- Point 1: "isobar vollst√§ndige Verdampfung" (isobaric complete evaporation)  
- The process transitions are described as "adiabatic expansion" and "ND Gebiet" (ND region).
