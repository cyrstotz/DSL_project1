The initial temperature \( T_i \) is given as \( -10^\circ\text{C} \), and the evaporator temperature \( T_{\text{evaporator}} \) is \( -16^\circ\text{C} \).  
The pressure \( p_{\text{evaporator}} \) is 5 bar, and the vapor quality \( x_1 \) is 0.  

Using enthalpy values:  
- \( h_1 = 53.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) (from saturated liquid at state 1).  
- \( h_2 = 269.45 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) (from Table A-11).  
- \( h_3 = 837.237.4 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) (from Table A-10).  

The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is calculated using the first law of thermodynamics:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) + \dot{W}_K  
\]
Rearranging:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_3 - h_2} = 0.000406 \, \text{kg/s}  
\]
