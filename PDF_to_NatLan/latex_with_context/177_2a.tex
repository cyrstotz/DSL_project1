The graph depicts a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_2/p_3 \), and \( p_5 \). The process is shown with six states:  
- State 0: Ambient conditions.  
- State 1: Pre-compression.  
- State 2: Compression.  
- State 3: Combustion.  
- State 4: Turbine expansion.  
- State 5: Mixing chamber.  
- State 6: Nozzle exit.  

The isobars are curved, and the transitions between states are represented by arrows indicating the thermodynamic processes. The axes are labeled \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (specific entropy) with units \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \).
