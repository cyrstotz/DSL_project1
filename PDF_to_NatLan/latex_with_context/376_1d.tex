The specific internal energy at \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \) is given as:  
\[
u_2 = u_f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.95 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The specific internal energy at \( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \) is calculated using the steam quality \( x_D \):  
\[
u_1 = u_f(100^\circ\text{C}) + x_D \left( u_g(100^\circ\text{C}) - u_f(100^\circ\text{C}) \right) = 303.833 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The specific enthalpy of the added saturated liquid water at \( T = 20^\circ\text{C} \) is:  
\[
h_{\text{in}} = h_f(20^\circ\text{C}) = 83.96 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The mass of water added to the reactor is determined as:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} = 132.275 \, \text{kg}
\]

The heat released during cooling is given as:  
\[
Q_{R,12} = 35 \, \text{MJ} = 35,000 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The system is described as an open system.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_{\text{ein}} + Q_{\text{aus}}
\]  

The internal energy values are specified:  
\[
u_1 = u_{\text{water}}(70^\circ\text{C}) \quad \text{saturated liquid, } x_D = 0
\]  
\[
u_2 = u_{\text{water}}(100^\circ\text{C}) \quad \text{saturated liquid, } x_D = 0.005
\]  

The enthalpy of the incoming mass is given as:  
\[
h_{\text{ein}} = h(20^\circ\text{C}) \quad \text{saturated liquid}
\]  

The relationship between \( u_2 \), \( u_1 \), and \( h_{\text{ein}} \) is expressed as:  
\[
u_2 = u_1 + s_{\text{m,12}} \quad \text{where } Q < 0
\]  

The detailed energy balance equation is expanded:  
\[
(m_2 + s_{\text{m,12}}) u_2 - m_1 u_1 = s_{\text{m,12}} h_{\text{ein}} + Q
\]  
\[
m_1 (u_2 - u_1) + s_{\text{m,12}} (u_2 - h_{\text{ein}}) = Q
\]  

Finally, solving for \( s_{\text{m,12}} \):  
\[
s_{\text{m,12}} = \frac{Q - m_1 (u_2 - u_1)}{(u_2 - h_{\text{ein}})}
\]
