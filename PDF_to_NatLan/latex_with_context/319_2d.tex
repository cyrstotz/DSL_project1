The equation for the rate of change of exergy is written as:  
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \Delta ex = \sum \Delta ex_{\text{in}} - \sum \Delta ex_{\text{out}} - \sum \left( \dot{m} \cdot w \cdot \frac{p_0}{\rho} \cdot c_p \right) - ex_{\text{real}}
\]  

It is stated that the exergy flow to the outside is zero (\( \Delta ex_{\text{out}} = 0 \)), and the activity to the outside is also zero.  

The exergy destruction is expressed as:  
\[
ex_{\text{real}} = \Delta ex_{\text{in}} - \Delta ex_{\text{out}}
\]  

By substituting the mass flow rate (\( \dot{m} \)), the exergy destruction is calculated as:  
\[
ex_{\text{real}} = \Delta ex_{\text{in}} - \Delta ex_{\text{out}}
\]  

The final result for \( ex_{\text{real}} \) is:  
\[
ex_{\text{real}} = 16.254 \, \text{kJ}
\]
