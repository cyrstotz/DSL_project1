The entropy production rate is calculated using the entropy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \, (s_{\text{in}} - s_{\text{out}}) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}.
\]  

Rearranging to solve for entropy generation:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = -\frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}} + \dot{m} \, (s_{\text{out}} - s_{\text{in}}).
\]  

This equation is expressed symbolically, with terms for heat flow and entropy differences clearly defined.
