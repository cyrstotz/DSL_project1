The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i (h_e - h_k) - \sum \dot{Q}_i - \sum \dot{W}_i
\]  
The equation for \( Q \) is given as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_i (h_3 - h_2) + \dot{W}_K
\]  
The mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} = -\frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_3 - h_2}
\]  
It is noted that \( h_3 \) corresponds to a pressure of 8 bar.
