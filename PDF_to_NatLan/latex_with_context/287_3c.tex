The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = \Delta u_{12} \cdot m = -1076.9 \cdot 0.3611 = -1076.36 \, \text{J}
\]

---

The transferred heat \( Q_{12} \) is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12} - W
\]  
The internal energy change is given by:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = m_g c_V (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) = 3.9 \cdot 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \cdot (0 - 500^\circ\text{C}) = -1076 \, \text{J}
\]  

The work \( W \) is calculated using:  
\[
W = \int p \, dV
\]  
Approximating for constant pressure:  
\[
W = p_g (V_2 - V_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m_g R T_2}{p}, \quad V_1 = \frac{m_g R T_1}{p}
\]  
\[
W = m_g R \left( \frac{T_2 - T_1}{p} \right) = 3.9 \cdot 0.166 \cdot \frac{(500 - 0)}{1.4 \, \text{bar}} = -0.00131 \, \text{m}^3
\]  

Finally, the heat transfer is:  
\[
Q_{12} = U_2 - U_1 + W = -1076 + (-0.00131) = -0.961078 \, \text{J}
\]
