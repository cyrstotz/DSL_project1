The first law of thermodynamics applied to the gas container is:  
\[
\Delta E = Q - W = \Delta U
\]

The heat transfer \( Q \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q = W + U_2 - U_1 = W + m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]

The work done is:  
\[
W = p_1 (V_2 - V_1)
\]

Thus, the heat transfer becomes:  
\[
Q = p_1 (V_2 - V_1) + m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]
