The evolution of \( T_i \) in Step ii is briefly discussed. If the cooling cycle from Step i continues with constant \( \dot{Q}_K \), the temperature \( T_i \) would decrease further due to continued heat removal.

\( T_i = 10^\circ\text{C} \)  
The temperature would decrease during the process and would no longer remain isothermal.
