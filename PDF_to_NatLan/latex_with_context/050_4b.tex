The process from state 2 to state 3 is described as "adiabatic and reversible."  

An energy balance equation is provided:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = 0 = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{Q}^{\text{ad}} - \dot{W}
\]  

Additional details:  
- \( h_2 \) corresponds to state 2 with \( x = 1 \) (likely indicating saturated vapor).  
- \( h_3 \) corresponds to state 3 at 8 bar.  

The work done (\( W_K \)) is calculated as:  
\[
W_K = -28 \, \text{W}
\]
