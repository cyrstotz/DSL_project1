The equation for exergy balance is given as:  

\[
0 = D_{ex,\text{STR}} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_j} \right) \dot{q}_j - \dot{u}_m - \dot{e}_{\text{REV}}
\]

The mass-specific exergy destruction (\( ex_{\text{dest}} \)) is equal to:  

\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = D_{ex,\text{STR}} = 125.47 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
