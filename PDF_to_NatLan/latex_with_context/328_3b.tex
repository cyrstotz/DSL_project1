The pressure \( p \) remains constant, meaning the conditions are the same as in state 1.  

Using the gas law, since the volume decreases, the temperature \( T_2 \) must also decrease. The relationship is given by:  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
Where \( n = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = 1.2627 \).  

Substituting the values:  
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
\[
T_2 = 273.15312 \, \text{K}
\]
