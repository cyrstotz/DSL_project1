A graph is drawn with pressure \( P \, [\text{Pa}] \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \, [\text{K}] \) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes the following features:  
- A curve labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point), separating the "Feucht-Fl√ºssig" (wet-liquid) region from the "Gas" (gas) region.  
- The curve extends into a "supercritical" region beyond the critical point.
