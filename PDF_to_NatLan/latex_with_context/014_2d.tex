The calculation uses \( 100 \, \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{kg}} \).  

An energy balance is applied to the entire system:  
\[
ex_{\text{fuel}} = \Delta ex_{\text{dest}} + \dots - \dot{W}_t
\]  

The turbine work is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{W}_t = w_{\text{workable mass}}
\]  

The reversible work is calculated using:  
\[
w_{\text{rev}} = R \frac{(T_6 - T_5)}{1 - n}
\]  

Substituting values, the result is:  
\[
w_{\text{rev}} = 65.935 \, \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{kg}}
\]
