The final temperature of the gas is \( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \), and the final pressure is \( p_{g,2} = p_{\text{amb}} = 1.966 \, \text{bar} \).  

**Explanation:**  
Since \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), the ice-water mixture remains in equilibrium, and all the heat added is used for melting ice rather than increasing the temperature. The system reaches thermal equilibrium, meaning the temperature of the gas and the ice-water mixture is the same.  

Regarding pressure: Since the external pressure and the mass remain constant, the pressure \( p \) automatically remains constant as well.
