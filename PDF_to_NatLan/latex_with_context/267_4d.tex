The process between states 1 and 2 is described as isothermal and isolated.  

The heat transfer \( \dot{Q}_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \cdot (h_2 - h_1) = 720.36 \, \text{W}
\]  

The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is determined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = 4.299
\]
