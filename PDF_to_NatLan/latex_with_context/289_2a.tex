The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(S\)) diagram. The graph includes labeled isobars and isentropic processes. Key points are marked as states \(0\), \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(5\), and \(6\). The isobaric and isentropic processes are clearly indicated, with arrows showing the direction of the process. The axes are labeled as \(T \, [^\circ\text{C}]\) for temperature and \(S \, [\text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K}]\) for entropy.
