A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows phase regions labeled as "gas," "fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "mixed." The curve separates the gas and liquid regions, and points labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), and \( 3 \) are marked along the curve.
