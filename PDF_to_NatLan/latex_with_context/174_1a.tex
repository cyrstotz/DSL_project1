The problem involves a stationary flow process with mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \).  

The energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \left[ h_a - h_e \right] + \dot{Q}^0 - \dot{W}^0
\]  

The heat transfer rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \left[ h_a - h_e \right]
\]  

The term \( \dot{Q}_{\text{gas}} \) is crossed out and not considered further.  

The overall energy balance is written as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_R + \dot{Q}_{\text{gas}} + \dot{Q}_{\text{in}} = 0
\]  

The heat input is described as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{in}} = \dot{m} \left[ h_a - h_e \right] - \dot{m} \left[ \text{in} \right]
\]  

The temperature difference is specified as:  
\[
\Delta T = 10 \, \text{K}
\]  

Finally, the heat transfer rate is simplified to:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \left[ h_a - h_e \right] = \dot{m} \cdot c \cdot \Delta T
\]
