The diagram is a T-s diagram (temperature vs. entropy) illustrating the thermodynamic processes in the jet engine. The axes are labeled as \( T \, [K] \) for temperature and \( s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}}] \) for specific entropy.  
- The process begins at point \( 1 \), moves to point \( 2 \) along an isentropic compression line.  
- From point \( 2 \) to point \( 3 \), the process follows an isobaric heat addition path.  
- The process then moves to point \( 4 \) along an isentropic expansion line.  
- Points \( 5 \) and \( 6 \) are connected by an isobaric mixing process.  
Arrows indicate the direction of the processes, and the labels "isobaric" and "isentropic" are written to describe the respective paths.
