The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is calculated using:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{T_{\text{in}} + T_{\text{out}}}{2}
\]  

Substituting the inlet and outlet temperatures:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{288.15 + 298.15}{2} = 293.65 \, \text{K}
\]  

This is valid because the heat capacity is assumed constant.
