A graph is drawn representing the thermodynamic process in a jet engine on a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), and the horizontal axis is labeled \( s \, \left[\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}\right] \). The process includes the following states:  
- State 1 to 2: A curved line indicating compression.  
- State 2 to 3: A vertical line labeled \( P_{23} \), representing isobaric heat addition.  
- State 3 to 4: A curved line indicating expansion.  
- State 4 to 5: A vertical line representing mixing.  
- State 5 to 6: A horizontal line indicating the nozzle process.
