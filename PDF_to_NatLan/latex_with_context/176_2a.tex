The first diagram represents a qualitative process in a T-s diagram. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis (in Kelvin), and entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis (in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)). The process begins at state \( O \) (ambient conditions) and proceeds through the following states:  
- \( O \) to \( 2 \): Isobaric compression  
- \( 2 \) to \( 3 \): Isentropic compression  
- \( 3 \) to \( 4 \): Adiabatic combustion  
- \( 4 \) to \( 5 \): Mixing process  
- \( 5 \) to \( 6 \): Isentropic expansion through the nozzle  

The diagram includes labeled isobars \( p_0/p_6 \) and \( p_5/p_2 \), as well as annotations for adiabatic and isentropic processes.
