A graph is drawn representing the process in a temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(S\)) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled \(T\) (K), representing temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \(S\) (\(kJ/\text{kgÂ·K}\)), representing entropy.  

The diagram shows a cycle with numbered states: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- State 1 transitions to state 2 with an upward curve.  
- State 2 transitions to state 3 with a steep upward line.  
- State 3 transitions to state 4 with a downward curve.  
- State 4 transitions to state 5 with a zigzag pattern, indicating mixing or turbulence.  
- State 5 transitions to state 6 with a downward curve.
