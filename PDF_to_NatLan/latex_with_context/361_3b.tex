The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}\), as the external forces remain the same.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to \( T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C}\), as the water remains in the ice-water phase equilibrium and is in the liquid-solid region. No heat transfer occurs, and \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}} \).
