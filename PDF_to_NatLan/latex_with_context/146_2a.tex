The process is described qualitatively in a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. The diagram includes the following labeled states and processes:  
- State 0: Ambient conditions.  
- State 1: Adiabatic compression.  
- State 2: Isobaric heating.  
- State 3: Adiabatic expansion.  
- State 4: Isobaric cooling.  
- State 5: Mixing chamber.  
- State 6: Nozzle exit.  

The diagram shows the temperature (\( T \)) on the vertical axis and entropy (\( s \)) on the horizontal axis. Isobars are drawn as horizontal lines, and the processes are labeled as adiabatic or isobaric transitions. Key points include:  
- \( p_1 = p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).
