The vapor quality \( x_1 \) at state 1 is determined using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{s_4 - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]  
Where:  
- \( s_4 \) is the entropy at state 4, calculated as the average of \( s_f \) values at 2.8 bar and 3.2 bar:  
\[
s_4 = \frac{s_f(2.8 \, \text{bar}) + s_f(3.2 \, \text{bar})}{2} = 0.2
\]  
- \( s_f \) and \( s_g \) are the saturated liquid and vapor entropies at state 1:  
\[
s_f = 0.08959, \quad s_g = 1.9350
\]  

The pressure \( p_1 = p_2 \), and \( p_2 = p_{\text{sat}}(T = 272 \, \text{K}) = 1.2432 \, \text{bar} \).  
Using the entropy values:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{0.2 - 0.08959}{1.9350 - 0.08959} = 0.131
\]
