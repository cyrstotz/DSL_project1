Entropy is generated at the wall during heat transfer.  

The system is steady-state, meaning \( \frac{dS}{dt} = 0 \).  

The entropy balance equation is:  
\[
\dot{S} = \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
Rearranging for entropy generation:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = -\frac{\dot{Q}}{T_{\text{KF}}}
\]  

Given:  
\[
\dot{Q} = -\dot{Q}_R + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = -100 + 62.182 = 37.818 \, \text{kW}
\]  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{37.818}{293.12} = 0.129 \, \text{kW/K}
\]  

A diagram is included showing heat flows \( \dot{Q}_R \) and \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) through the reactor wall to the coolant, labeled with arrows. The coolant temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} = 293.12 \, \text{K} \) is noted.
