The energy balance for the cooling process is expressed as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_2 - h_1) + \dot{Q}_K
\]
Rearranging:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} (h_2 - h_1)
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = 0.053 \, (238.08 - 33.42) = 12 \, \text{kW}
\]

Additionally, it is noted that:  
Water immediately transitions into the gas phase.
