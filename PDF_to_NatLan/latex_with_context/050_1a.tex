The heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) removed by the coolant is calculated using the energy balance equation:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = 0 = \dot{m} (h_{\text{zw}} - h_{\text{aw}}) + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  
where \( h_{\text{aw}} \) corresponds to the enthalpy at \( 70^\circ\text{C} \) (saturated liquid, \( x = 1 \)) and \( h_{\text{zw}} \) corresponds to the enthalpy at \( 100^\circ\text{C} \) (saturated liquid, \( x = 1 \)).  

The heat flow is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} (h_{\text{zw}} - h_{\text{aw}})
\]  

Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. A schematic of the reactor showing inlet and outlet streams labeled \( h_{\text{aw}} \), \( h_{\text{zw}} \), and the heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \) removed by the coolant.  
2. A simplified representation of the reactor with arrows indicating the flow directions and heat transfer.
