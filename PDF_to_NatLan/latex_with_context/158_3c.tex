The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q - W
\]  
Since there is no work done, this simplifies to:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta U
\]  

The change in internal energy is given by:  
\[
\Delta U = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1
\]  
or equivalently:  
\[
\Delta U = m (u_2 - u_1)
\]  

The relevant temperatures are:  
\[
T_1 = 273.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_2 = 273.183 \, \text{K}
\]  

The specific internal energy at state 2 is:  
\[
u_2 = -333.401 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
