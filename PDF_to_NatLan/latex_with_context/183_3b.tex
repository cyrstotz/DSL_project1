The temperature of the gas in state 2 will remain constant because the temperature of the ice-water mixture is fixed at phase equilibrium. The temperature of the gas will be:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 273.15 \, \text{K} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]

The final temperature is the same as \( T_{\text{EW}} \), because the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium.

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is \( 1.4 \, \text{bar} \), as the mass pressing on the ice remains constant.
