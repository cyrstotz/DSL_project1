The diagram is a temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(s\)) plot illustrating the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine. The following features are labeled:  
- Isobars \(p_2/p_3\), \(p_5=p_4\), and \(p_0=p_6\).  
- Points 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the process path.  
- The graph shows the progression of states, including compression, combustion, and expansion.  
- Axes are labeled as \(T \, [\text{K}]\) for temperature and \(s \, [\text{L}/\text{kg}] \, [\text{J}/\text{kgÂ·K}]\) for entropy.  

Additional equations are written:  
\[
\dot{p} = \frac{nRT}{V}, \quad T = \frac{\rho V^{\gamma}}{nR}
\]
