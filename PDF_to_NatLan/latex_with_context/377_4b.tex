The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{-\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
where \( \dot{W}_K \) is the work done by the compressor, and \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are the specific enthalpies at states 2 and 3, respectively. The enthalpy values \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are to be obtained from the relevant tables.
