The mass flow rate is given as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{in}} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s}
\]

The heat flow equation is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_j = \dot{m}(h_a - h_e) = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_1)
\]

The enthalpy at the inlet (\( h_a \)) is calculated based on the following conditions:  
- Temperature \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Steam quality \( x = 1 \)  
From Table A2, the enthalpy value is:  
\[
h_1 = 2626.8 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The enthalpy at the outlet (\( h_2 \)) is determined under the following conditions:  
- Temperature \( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \)  
From Table A2, the enthalpy value is:  
\[
h_2 = 2676.1 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The heat flow is calculated using the corrected equation:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_1)
\]  
The result is:  
\[
Q = 14.79 \, \text{kW}
\]

Initial conditions:  
\[
u_1 = 100^\circ\text{C}, \quad x_0 = 0.005, \quad u_{\text{in}} = 429.39 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad u_2 = 2469.6 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The heat transfer equation is:  
\[
Q = (m + m_{\text{in}}) u
\]  
Substituting:  
\[
Q = m + m_{\text{in}} u = 2538.4 \, \text{kJ}
\]
