The process is depicted qualitatively in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram shows six states labeled 1 through 6, connected by various processes. The isobars are labeled as \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), and \( p = p_2 \). The ambient temperature is given as \( T_0 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \), calculated from \( T_0 = 273.15 - 30 \). The entropy axis is labeled \( s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}] \), and the temperature axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \).
