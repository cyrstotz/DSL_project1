The pressure remains the same as in state 1 because the forces acting on the piston have not changed. Thus:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The temperature has changed because energy was transferred to melt the ice.  

The specific heat capacities are given as:  
\[
c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg路K}
\]  
\[
c_p = R + c_V = 166.28 \, \text{J/kg路K} + 633 \, \text{J/kg路K} = 799.28 \, \text{J/kg路K}
\]
