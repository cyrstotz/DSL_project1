The temperature of the ice-water mixture \( T_{\text{EW},2} \) is \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

Since the ice remains present, the temperature remains constant at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The pressure \( p_{\text{EW},2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} = 135565.5 \, \text{Pa} \).  

The external force acting on the system, the cylinder area, and the volume of the ice-water mixture remain constant, so the pressure also remains unchanged.
