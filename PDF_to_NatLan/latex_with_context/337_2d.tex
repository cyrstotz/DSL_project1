The exergy destruction is calculated as follows:  
\[
ex_{\text{verl}} = ?
\]  
The system is adiabatic, and the equation for exergy destruction is:  
\[
\frac{d ex_{\text{str}}}{dt} = \Delta ex_{\text{str}} - ex_{\text{verl}}
\]  
From the calculations:  
\[
ex_{\text{verl}} = \Delta ex_{\text{str}} = 116.487 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
