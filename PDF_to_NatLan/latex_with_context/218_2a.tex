The problem involves an ideal gas and air under the following conditions:  
- Ambient pressure \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
- Ambient temperature \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} \)  

The process diagram includes states labeled from 0 to 6:  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \)  
- \( p_5 = p_2 \)  
- \( s_1 = s_2 \)  
- \( s_2 = s_5 \)  

A temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram is drawn, showing the thermodynamic process qualitatively:  
- The diagram includes isobars for \( p_0 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_5 \).  
- States 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked.  
- The curve transitions from state 0 to state 2, then to state 3, 4, 5, and finally 6.  
- The temperature at state 5 is \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \), and the pressure at state 5 is \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The pressure at state 6 is \( p_6 = p_0 \).
