The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant is calculated using the equation:  
\[
C_{\text{it}} \dot{m} = -\frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{\Delta T} = 6.2182 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{sÂ·K}}
\]  
where \( \Delta T \) is the temperature difference of the coolant.  
The entropy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = \dot{m}(s_e - s_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
The thermodynamic mean temperature \( \bar{T}_h \) is calculated as:  
\[
\bar{T}_h = 293.72 \, \text{K}
\]
