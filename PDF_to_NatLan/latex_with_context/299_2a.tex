The problem setup begins with the following parameters:  
- Ambient pressure \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
- Ambient temperature \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Airspeed \( w_{\text{air}} = 200 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- The ratio of bypass to core mass flow rates is \( \frac{\dot{m}_M}{\dot{m}_K} = 5.293 \).  
- Specific heat capacity of air \( c_{p,\text{air}} = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).  
- Adiabatic index \( \kappa = 1.4 \).  

The jet engine operates through several thermodynamic states:  
1. \( p_1 = p_3 \)  
2. \( p_2 = p_3 \)  
3. \( p_3 = p_4 \)  
4. \( T_5 = 437.9 \, \text{K} \), \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s} \).  
5. \( p_6 = p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).
