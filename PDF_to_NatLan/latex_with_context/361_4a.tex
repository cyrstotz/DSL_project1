The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It shows three distinct regions labeled "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). Two steps are marked:  
- Step \( i \): Transition from the solid phase to the liquid phase.  
- Step \( ii \): Transition from the liquid phase to the gas phase.  
The axes are labeled \( p \) (pressure) and \( T \) (temperature), with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
