For a perfect gas under isobaric conditions:  
\[
m(h_2 - h_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
Given \( T_2 = 500 \, \text{K} \), the equation becomes:  
\[
m(c_V + R) \Delta (T_2 - T_1) = Q_{12}
\]  
The heat transfer is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1.367 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

A simple diagram is drawn to represent the system. It shows two chambers labeled "EW" (ice-water mixture) and "Gas," separated by a membrane. Heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) flows from the gas chamber to the EW chamber.
