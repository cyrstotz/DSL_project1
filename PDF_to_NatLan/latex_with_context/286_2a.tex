A graph is drawn showing a qualitative temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) diagram for the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled points corresponding to different states (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). The process transitions are marked as "isobar" for constant pressure processes. The graph starts at state 1, moves to state 2, then state 3, followed by state 4, state 5, and finally state 6. The axes are labeled with \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( S \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis.
