The process is represented qualitatively in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram shows the thermodynamic process of the jet engine with labeled states: \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The isobars \( p_0 = p_6 \), \( p_2 = p_3 \), and \( p_5 \) are indicated. The curve transitions between states, illustrating compression, combustion, expansion, and mixing processes. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin) and \( s \) (specific entropy in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)).
