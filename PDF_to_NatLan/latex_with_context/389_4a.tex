Two pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagrams are drawn.  

1. The first diagram shows phase regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "gas" (gas). The triple point (TP) is marked, and the phase boundaries are clearly indicated. The diagram includes points labeled "1" and "2" within the gas region.  
2. The second diagram is similar, with the same phase regions and triple point labeled. The phase boundaries are drawn, and points "1" and "2" are marked in the gas region.
