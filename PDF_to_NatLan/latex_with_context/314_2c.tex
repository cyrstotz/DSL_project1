The mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = \dot{m}_K \left( h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} \right)
\]

Intermediate values for \( h_6 \), \( h_0 \), \( s_6 \), and \( s_0 \) are substituted into the equation.
