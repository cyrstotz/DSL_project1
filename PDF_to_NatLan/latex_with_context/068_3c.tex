Description of Diagram:  
The diagram illustrates the cylinder setup with the piston, ice-water mixture (EW), and atmospheric pressure. Forces and pressures are labeled clearly, showing the contributions of \( p_K \), \( p_{\text{EW}} \), and \( p_{\text{amb}} \) to the total pressure \( p_1 \).

\( x_2 = \)
