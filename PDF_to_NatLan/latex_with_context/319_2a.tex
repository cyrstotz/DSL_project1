A graph is drawn representing a T-s diagram for the jet engine process. The axes are labeled:  
- The x-axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  
- The y-axis represents temperature \( T \) in \( \text{K} \).  

Three isobars are shown:  
- \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) (ambient pressure).  
- \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- \( p = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  

The process is depicted with numbered states (1 through 6) connected by curves:  
- State 1 to 2 shows compression.  
- State 2 to 3 represents heating.  
- State 3 to 5 shows expansion.  
- State 5 to 6 represents mixing and nozzle exit.
