The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) diagram.  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), representing temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( S \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}] \), representing entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.  
- The process includes labeled isobars:  
  - \( P_2 = P_3 \)  
  - \( P_4 = P_5 = P_1 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - \( P_0 = P_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  

The diagram shows six states (1 through 6) connected by process lines:  
- State 1 to State 2 is vertical, indicating an adiabatic compression.  
- State 3 to State 4 is horizontal, indicating isobaric heat addition.  
- State 5 to State 6 is vertical, indicating adiabatic expansion.  
- \( S_1 = S_2 \) and \( S_5 = S_6 \) are marked, showing constant entropy during adiabatic processes.
