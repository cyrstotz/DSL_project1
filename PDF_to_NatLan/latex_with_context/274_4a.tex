A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn to represent the freeze-drying process (Steps i and ii). The diagram includes labeled points corresponding to states 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- The \( y \)-axis is labeled as \( p \) (pressure in bar).  
- The \( x \)-axis is labeled as \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The curve shows phase regions, with transitions between states marked.  
- State 3 is at the highest pressure, and state 4 is at a lower pressure.  
- State 2 is indicated near the sublimation temperature.
