The exergy balance equation is extended to include all relevant terms for steady-state operation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_c - h_a - T_0 (s_c - s_a) \right) + \dot{Q}_{\text{KF}} \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_{\text{KF}}} \right) + \dot{W}_{\text{in}} - \sum_{u} \dot{E}_{\text{in}} - \dot{E}_{\text{out}}.
\]  
Here, \( h_c \) and \( h_a \) represent enthalpy at different states, \( s_c \) and \( s_a \) represent entropy at different states, and \( \dot{E}_{\text{out}} \) is the exergy output.  

Additional terms such as kinetic energy changes (\( \frac{1}{2} (w_6^2 - w_0^2) \)) are included where applicable.
