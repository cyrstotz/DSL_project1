The equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture is given as \( T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} \). The ice mass fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{m_{\text{ice}}}{m_{\text{EW}}}
\]  
Where:  
\[
m_{\text{ice}} = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 \, \text{kg} = 0.06 \, \text{kg}
\]  

General system energy balance is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q - W_{\text{vu}}
\]  
The energy balance includes contributions from the ice and water masses:  
\[
m_{\text{ice}}(u_2) + m_{\text{EW}}(u_2) + M
\]  
The final volume of the ice-water mixture is expressed as:  
\[
V_{\text{EW}} = V_2 \cdot m_{\text{EW}}
\]  

A small sketch is present, showing equilibrium conditions at \( p_{g,2} = p_{\text{amb}} = 1 \, \text{bar} \). Below the sketch, the text states:  
"Equilibrium reached due to internal energy exchange."  

No further calculations or explanations are visible.

For the gas system, the energy balance is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = Q_{zu} - W
\]  
The heat transfer is expressed as:  
\[
c_V(T_2 - T_1) = m_g c_p(T_2 - T_1) - W
\]  
The relationship between \( c_p \) and \( c_V \) is given as:  
\[
c_p = R + c_V
\]
