A diagram is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The diagram includes phase regions labeled as "sublimation," "triple point," and "cooling cycle." Several arrows and lines are drawn to indicate transitions between states, including states labeled as "1," "2," and "3." However, the diagram is heavily crossed out and unclear.

The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) phase diagram. It shows the phase regions for a substance: solid ("Fest"), liquid ("fl√ºssig"), and gas ("Gas").  

- The curve labeled "Tripel" represents the triple point where solid, liquid, and gas phases coexist in equilibrium.  
- A horizontal line is drawn in the liquid region, indicating isobaric processes.  
- Two points are marked along this line, connected by a vertical line, which suggests a transition between phases (possibly evaporation or condensation).  
- The axes are labeled: the vertical axis is pressure (\( p \)) and the horizontal axis is temperature (\( T \)).
