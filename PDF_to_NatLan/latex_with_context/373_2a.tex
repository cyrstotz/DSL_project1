The diagram provided is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram.  

- The vertical axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  

The process is illustrated with labeled states:  
1. State 1 is the initial condition.  
2. State 2 shows an increase in entropy and temperature due to compression.  
3. State 3 represents the combustion process, where temperature rises significantly at constant entropy.  
4. State 4 shows a decrease in temperature and entropy due to expansion in the turbine.  
5. State 5 represents the mixing chamber, where entropy increases slightly.  
6. State \( T_0 \) indicates ambient conditions, and \( T_B \) represents the temperature during combustion.  

The graph includes isobars (curved lines) for different pressures, with the process transitions clearly marked between states.
