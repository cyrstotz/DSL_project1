The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\sum \dot{m}_i (h_i + \frac{v_i^2}{2} + g z_i) + \dot{Q} + \dot{W}
\]  
This equation is simplified to:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q} + \dot{W}
\]  
The mass flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W} - \dot{Q}}{h_e - h_a}
\]  

A table is provided with the following values:  
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{State} & p (\text{bar}) & T (\text{K}) & x \\
\hline
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
2 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
3 & 8 \, \text{bar} & 1 & 0 \\
4 & 8 \, \text{bar} & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]  

Additional notes:  
- The heat transfer equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a)
\]  
- Questions are posed regarding specific values:  
  - \( \dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{W} \)  
  - \( Q_i = ? \)  
  - \( Q_{\text{ab}} = ? \)  

Final equation for heat transfer between states 1 and 2:  
\[
\dot{m} (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q} = \dot{Q} \implies \dot{Q} = \dot{m} (h_a - h_e)
\]
