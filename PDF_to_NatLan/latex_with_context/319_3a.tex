The force balance equation is used to determine the pressure \( p_{g,1} \). Since the ice-water mixture (EW) is incompressible, the area \( A \) is calculated as:  
\[
A = \frac{D^2 \pi}{4}
\]  
The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is expressed as:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{A \cdot m_K \cdot g}{A}
\]  
Substituting values, \( p_{g,1} = 1.3897 \, \text{bar} \).  

The mass of the gas \( m_g \) is determined using the ideal gas law:  
\[
pV = mRT
\]  
Rearranging for \( m \):  
\[
m = \frac{pV}{RT}
\]  
The specific gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\[
R = \frac{R_u}{M} = \frac{8.314}{50} = 0.16628 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  
Finally, substituting values:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} = 3.478 \, \text{g}
\]
