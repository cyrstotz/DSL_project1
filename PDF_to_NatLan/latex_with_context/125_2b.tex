The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
T_6 = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} \cdot T_5
\]  
Here, \( \kappa = 1.4 \), \( p_6 \) is the pressure at state \( 6 \), \( p_5 \) is the pressure at state \( 5 \), and \( T_5 \) is the temperature at state \( 5 \).  

The result is \( T_6 = 520.45 \, \text{K} \).
