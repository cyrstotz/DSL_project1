This is an isobaric process, meaning \( p = \text{const} \).  

From the first law of thermodynamics:  
\[
\Delta U = Q - W \implies Q = \Delta U + W = m_g c_V \Delta T + p \Delta V
\]  

The heat transferred is:  
\[
Q = 1772.275 \, \text{J}
\]  

The change in volume is negligible:  
\[
\Delta V = \left| V_2 - V_1 \right| = \frac{R T}{p} \approx 0.002
\]
