The mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_0 \) is calculated using the equation:  
\[
\dot{m}_0 = \rho_6 A_6 w_6 \left( \frac{T_b}{T_5} \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
where \( T_b = 32.8 \, \text{K} \).  

Additionally, the following relationships are derived:  
\[
p = \frac{1}{v_0}, \quad p_6 v_6 = m_6 R T_6, \quad R = \frac{c_p - c_v}{n} = 0.287 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]
