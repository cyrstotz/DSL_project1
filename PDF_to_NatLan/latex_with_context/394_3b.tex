The problem involves determining \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \).  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \) because the system reaches equilibrium with no external force changes. This is due to the equal density of water and ice and the constant volume.  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The equilibrium temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is the same as the final temperature of the ice-water mixture, which is \( T_{EW,2} \).  

Additional crossed-out equations and text are ignored as per instructions.  

The explanation concludes with:  
Since the ice-water mixture in the cylinder has not completely melted, the temperature must remain at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) until all ice is melted, as this is the phase equilibrium temperature.
