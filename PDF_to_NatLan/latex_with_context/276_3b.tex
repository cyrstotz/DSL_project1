Since the density of ice and melted ice remains constant (melting does not change volume), the volume of the ice-water mixture in state 1 is equal to the volume in state 2:  
\[
V_{\text{EW,1}} = V_{\text{EW,2}}
\]  

Thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved, so:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}}
\]  

The gas pressure \( p_{g,2} \) can be calculated using the ideal gas law.
