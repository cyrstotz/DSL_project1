The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) and temperature \( T_{g,2} \) are determined:  

1. The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \) because the piston maintains the same force balance:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.401 \, \text{bar}
\]  

2. Since \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), the temperature of the ice-water mixture (EW) must remain at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) due to phase equilibrium. Thus:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]
