The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( P \)-\( T \)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process.  
- The graph includes labeled regions for solid ("Fest"), liquid ("flüssig"), and gaseous ("gasförmig") phases.  
- The triple point ("Tripel") is marked where all three phases coexist.  
- An isobaric process ("isobar, i") and an isothermal process ("isotherm, ii") are indicated with arrows.  
- The axes are labeled \( P \) (pressure) and \( T \) (temperature).
