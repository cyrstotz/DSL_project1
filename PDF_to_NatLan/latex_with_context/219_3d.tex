The first law of thermodynamics for the ice-water mixture (EW) is expressed as:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  

The internal energy at state 1 is calculated using:  
\[
u_1 = u_f + x_1 (u_s - u_f)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_1 = -200.03 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(from Table 1)}
\]  

The internal energy at state 2 is calculated using:  
\[
u_2 = Q_{12} + u_1 = u_f + x_2 (u_s - u_f)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
u_2 = -183.94 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(from Table 2)}
\]  

The ice fraction at state 2 is determined as:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_s - u_f}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_2 = 0.5638
\]
