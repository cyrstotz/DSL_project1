The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) graph showing the freeze-drying process.  
- The graph includes labeled phase regions: "Gas", "Absorption", and "Desorption".  
- The temperature axis (\( T \)) ranges from \(-50^\circ\text{C}\) to \( 0^\circ\text{C}\), with increments of \( 10^\circ\text{C} \).  
- A point labeled "1" is marked at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), and another point labeled "2" is marked at \(-10^\circ\text{C}\).  
- The graph indicates a temperature difference of \( 10 \, \text{K} \) and a pressure reduction of \( 5 \, \text{mbar} \) below the triple point of water.
