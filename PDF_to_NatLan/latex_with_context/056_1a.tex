The mass flow rate at the inlet is given as:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{in}} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s}
\]  
This is a steady-state flow process.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}}) + \Sigma \dot{Q}
\]  
where:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}}) + \dot{Q}_R
\]  

The enthalpy values are determined from the water tables:  
\[
h_{\text{in}} = h_f(70^\circ\text{C}) = 2676.8 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
h_{\text{out}} = h_f(100^\circ\text{C}) = 419.0 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \quad \text{(from Table A-2)}
\]  

Substituting these values:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 85.24 \, \text{kW}
\]  

It is noted that \(\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}\) is defined as negative.
