A graph is drawn showing the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram.  
- The diagram includes phase regions labeled as "gas," "liquid," and "solid."  
- The sublimation curve is marked, along with the triple point.  
- Axes are labeled: \( p \) (pressure in bar) on the vertical axis and \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis.
