The diagram shows a qualitative representation of the jet engine process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) [K] on the vertical axis (temperature).  
- \( s \) [kJ/kgÂ·K] on the horizontal axis (specific entropy).  

The diagram includes the following features:  
- Isobar \( p_0 \) (ambient pressure) and isobar \( p_5 \) (pressure after mixing chamber).  
- The process path is marked with numbered states: \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \).  
- The transitions between states are shown with arrows, indicating compression, combustion, and expansion processes.  
- The entropy increases during the combustion process, while the compression and expansion processes are nearly vertical, representing adiabatic changes.
