The energy balance for the cooling process is written as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a \right]
\]  
where \( h_e \) and \( h_a \) are enthalpies at specific states.  

Another equation is provided:  
\[
Q_{\text{in}} = \left[ h_4 - h_2 \right] + Q_K
\]  

The enthalpy difference is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_1 \right]
\]  

For the transition from state 2 to state 3:  
- \( s \) is constant (\( s_2 = s_3 \)).  
- \( s_3 \) corresponds to 8 bar.  

The work done by the compressor is given as:  
\[
W_K = 28 \, \text{W}
\]  

The mass flow rate equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] = 28 \, \text{W}
\]
