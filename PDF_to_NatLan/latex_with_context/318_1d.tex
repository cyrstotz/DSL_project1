The heat released during cooling is given as \( Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \, \text{MJ} \).  

The mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) of saturated liquid water added is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
m_2 h_2 = m_1 h_1 + \Delta m_{12} h_{12}
\]  
The energy of water in saturated state 1 is expressed as:  
\[
x \cdot m_{g0} h_g + (1-x) \cdot m_{g0} h_f
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
h_g = 2676.1 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}, \quad h_f = 419.0 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
2406.88 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} = H_{\text{gas}}
\]  

No further numerical solution is provided for \( \Delta m_{12} \).
