A diagram is drawn showing heat transfer through a wall labeled "Wand." The heat flow \( \dot{Q} \) is given as \( 65 \, \text{kW} \), with temperatures \( T_{\text{KF}} = 285 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_R = 373.15 \, \text{K} \). The entropy balance around the wall is expressed as:  
\[
0 + \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{373.15 \, \text{K}} - \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{285 \, \text{K}} + \dot{S}_{\text{erz}} = 0
\]  
The entropy generation rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{erz}} = 0.04675 \, \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}} = 416.15 \, \frac{\text{W}}{\text{K}}
\]
