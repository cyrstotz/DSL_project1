To determine \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \):  

The ice-water mixture (EW) consists of ice and water at phase equilibrium. The temperature of the EW is:  
\[
T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K}
\]  

No further heat exchange occurs, so the gas temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to the EW temperature:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K}
\]  

The gas pressure \( p_{g,2} \) remains constant because the ambient pressure \( p_{\text{amb}} \), the piston mass, and the EW mass remain unchanged:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 7.407 \, \text{bar}
\]
