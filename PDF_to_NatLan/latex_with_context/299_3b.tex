The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated as \( 1.5 \, \text{bar} \). The mass \( m_g \) is determined as \( 3.6 \, \text{g} \). The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is related to \( T_{g,1} \) by the following expression:  
\[
T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is also calculated.
