The diagram represents a qualitative \( T-s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The graph shows six states labeled \( 1 \) through \( 6 \), with the temperature \( T \) increasing along the vertical axis and entropy \( s \) increasing along the horizontal axis. The pressure \( p \) is indicated as constant at \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) for certain states. The process includes compression (state \( 1 \) to \( 3 \)), combustion (state \( 3 \) to \( 4 \)), turbine expansion (state \( 4 \) to \( 5 \)), and mixing/nozzle exit (state \( 5 \) to \( 6 \)).
