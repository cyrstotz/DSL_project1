A graph is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The axes are labeled as pressure (\( p \)) and temperature (\( T \)), with a curve showing phase transitions. Three states are marked: state 1, state 2, and state 3, connected by arrows indicating the process flow.
