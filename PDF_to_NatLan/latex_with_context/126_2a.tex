The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and process states:  
- State 0 represents ambient conditions.  
- State 1 shows the inlet air.  
- State 2 corresponds to the compressed air.  
- State 3 is the combustion chamber outlet.  
- State 4 represents the turbine outlet.  
- State 5 is the mixing chamber outlet.  
- State 6 is the nozzle exit.  

The diagram shows increasing entropy (\( s \)) along the horizontal axis and temperature (\( T \)) along the vertical axis. The isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_{4,5} \), and \( p_{2,3} \) are clearly marked. The processes include compression, combustion, expansion, and mixing.
