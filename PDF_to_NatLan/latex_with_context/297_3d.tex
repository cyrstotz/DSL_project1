The energy balance for the system on the ice-water side is:  
\[
\Delta E = E_2 - m_{\text{EW}} \cdot E_1 = Q_{12}
\]  
The heat transfer is:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (u_2 - u_1)
\]  
The pressure on the ice-water side is:  
\[
p_{\text{EW}} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{F_{p,K}}{A} = 1.6 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The internal energy change is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = u_1 + \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}} = -1855.1 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
The temperature in state 2 is:  
\[
T_{2,\text{EW}} = 0.003^\circ \text{C}
\]  

The final ice fraction is calculated using the solid-liquid equilibrium table:  
\[
x_{2,\text{ice}} = \frac{u_2 - u_{2,\text{fluid}}}{u_{\text{fluid},2} - u_{\text{ice},2}} = 0.555
\]
