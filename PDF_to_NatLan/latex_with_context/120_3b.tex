Since no additional forces are acting on the system, the process in the cylinder is isobaric, and the density of water remains constant. Therefore, \( p_{Eis} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).  

In state 2, the ice-water mixture is in equilibrium, and the temperature \( T_{2w} = T_{2g} = 0^\circ\text{C} \). The system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium. Hence:  
\[
T_{2w} = T_{2g} = 0^\circ\text{C}.
\]
