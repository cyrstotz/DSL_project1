A graph is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a \( T \)-\( \text{in} \) diagram. The graph shows four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The curve starts at state 1, rises to state 2, then peaks at state 3, and finally descends to state 4. The axes are labeled \( T \) (temperature) and \( T_{\text{in}} \) (input temperature).
