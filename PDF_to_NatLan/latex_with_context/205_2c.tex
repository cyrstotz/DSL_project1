The equation for the mass-specific increase in flow exergy is written as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_6 - h_0 - T_0 \cdot (s_6 - s_0)) + \Delta KE
\]  
where \(h_6\) and \(h_0\) are specific enthalpies, \(T_0\) is the ambient temperature, \(s_6\) and \(s_0\) are specific entropies, and \(\Delta KE\) represents the change in kinetic energy.
