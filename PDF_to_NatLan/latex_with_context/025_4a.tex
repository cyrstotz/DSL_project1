A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled as \( T \, [\text{K}] \) (temperature in Kelvin) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( P \, [\text{bar}] \) (pressure in bar). The graph shows a horizontal line indicating constant pressure, followed by a vertical line indicating a change in temperature.
