The process is illustrated in a T-s diagram. The diagram shows a thermodynamic cycle with labeled points:  
- Point \( O \) represents the ambient state.  
- Point \( 1 \) is the inlet to the compressor.  
- Point \( 2 \) is the outlet of the compressor.  
- Point \( 3 \) is the inlet to the combustion chamber.  
- Point \( 4 \) is the outlet of the combustion chamber.  
- Point \( 5 \) is the outlet of the turbine.  
- Point \( 6 \) is the nozzle exit.  

The diagram includes isobars \( p_0 \) and \( p_2 \), which curve upwards. The cycle follows the sequence \( O \to 1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 4 \to 5 \to 6 \), with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
