A pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram is drawn, showing the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes labeled points corresponding to states \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), and \(4\).  
- The curve represents the phase boundaries, with the region labeled "Nassdampfgebiet" (wet steam region).  
- Isobaric processes are indicated between states \(1\) and \(2\), and between states \(3\) and \(4\).  
- The transition from state \(2\) to \(3\) is depicted as a steep line, likely representing compression.  
- The \(T\)-axis is horizontal, and the \(p\)-axis is vertical.
