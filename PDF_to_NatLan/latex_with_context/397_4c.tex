The vapor quality \( x_1 \) at state 1 is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{u_1 - u_f}{u_g - u_f}
\]  
where \( u_1 \) is the specific internal energy at state 1, \( u_f \) is the specific internal energy of the saturated liquid, and \( u_g \) is the specific internal energy of the saturated vapor.  
It is noted that \( u_1 = u_f \).
