The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is given as:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

Explanation: Not all the ice has melted, and yet both chambers are in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means the EW has a temperature of \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), and the gas does as well.  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is calculated as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Further explanation: The atmospheric pressure and the weight force of the piston and EW act on the same area. The EW remains constant in density, so the pressure also remains constant.
