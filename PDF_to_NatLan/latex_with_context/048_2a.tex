The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and process paths:  
- State 0 represents ambient conditions at \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} \).  
- State 1 shows the adiabatic reversible compression.  
- State 3 represents the isobaric combustion process.  
- State 5 shows the adiabatic reversible mixing.  
- State 6 represents the nozzle exit.  
The isobars are labeled as \( 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) and \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \). The paths are marked as adiabatic reversible and isobaric processes.
