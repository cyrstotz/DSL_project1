The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is calculated using the energy balance for the heat exchanger process:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a \right) = \dot{m} \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) + \dot{W}_{\text{trim}}
\]  
Rearranging for \( \dot{m} \):  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{Q}}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
The equation assumes steady-state operation and neglects kinetic and potential energy changes.  

A note indicates \( \dot{Q} = 1 \, \text{kW} \).
