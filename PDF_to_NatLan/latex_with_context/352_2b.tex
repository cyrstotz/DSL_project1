The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{E} = \sum \dot{h} + \sum \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}
\]  
This equation accounts for enthalpy \( h \), heat transfer \( Q \), and work \( W \).  

Additionally, the equation for mass flow rate is provided:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}})
\]  
This represents the steady-state energy balance for the system.
