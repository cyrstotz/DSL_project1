The refrigerant mass flow rate is calculated using the following parameters:  
- \( x_4 = 0 \)  
- \( h_4 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)

The enthalpy \( h_3 \) is interpolated using the formula:  
\[
h_3 = h_{\text{sat}} + \frac{h(40) - h_{\text{sat}}}{s(r0) - s_{\text{sat}}} \cdot (s_{82} - s_{\text{sat}})
\]  
The interpolated value for \( h_3 \) is calculated as \( h_3 = 272.95 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

The work \( -W_{12} \) is calculated using:  
\[
-W_{12} = m(h_2 - h_3)
\]  
Rearranging for \( m \):  
\[
m = \frac{-W_{12}}{h_2 - h_3} = 1.52 \, \text{kg}
\]
