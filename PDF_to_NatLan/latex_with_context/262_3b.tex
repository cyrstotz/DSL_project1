Since state 2 represents equilibrium and ice is still present, the temperature \( T_{g,2} \) must be the same as \( T_{\text{EW},2} \), which is \( T = 0^\circ\text{C} \).  
Given that the piston is specified as frictionless, it does not affect the temperature or hinder equilibrium.  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]
