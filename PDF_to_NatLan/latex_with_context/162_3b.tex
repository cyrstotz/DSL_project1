The volume \( V_1 \) is equal to \( V_2 \):  
\[
V_1 = V_2 = V_m = 0.0314 \, \text{m}^3
\]  
The temperature ratio \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \) is used to calculate the vapor quality \( X \):  
\[
X = \frac{V_{g,2} - V_{f} C_{T_2}}{V_{g,1} T_{f} C_{T_2}}
\]  
The equation for energy balance is:  
\[
A + U = Q \implies m (u_2 - u_1) = m_{\text{phase}} (T_2 - T_1)
\]
