A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) (in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in \( ^\circ \text{C} \)) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows three distinct regions labeled "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). The curve separating the solid and liquid regions is marked with a point labeled "1," while the curve separating the liquid and gas regions is marked with a point labeled "2." The intersection of all three regions is labeled "Tripel" (triple point).
