The problem involves determining the mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) of saturated liquid water added to the reactor to reduce its temperature from \( T_1 = 100^\circ\text{C} \) to \( T_2 = 70^\circ\text{C} \). The following values and equations are used:

Initial conditions:  
- \( T_1 = 100^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Steam quality \( x_D = 0.005 \)  
- Total reactor mass \( m_{\text{gas}} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \)  

Final conditions:  
- \( T_2 = 70^\circ\text{C} \)  

Additional information:  
- Added mass temperature \( T_{\text{in}} = 20^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Heat released during cooling \( Q_{R,12} = Q_{\text{out},12} = 35,000 \, \text{kJ} \)  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
m_2 U_2 - m_1 U_1 = \Delta m_{\text{in}} h_{\text{in}} + Q_{R,12}
\]  

Rearranging for \( \Delta m_{\text{in}} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{\text{in}} = \frac{m_2 U_2 - m_1 U_1 - Q_{R,12}}{h_{\text{in}}}
\]  

Values used:  
- \( h_{\text{in}} = 53.96 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  
- \( m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{\text{in}} \)  
- \( m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg} \)  
- \( U_1 = 421.377 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  
- \( U_2 = 292.955 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  
- \( Q_{R,12} = 35,000 \, \text{kJ} \)  

Substituting these values into the equation:  
\[
\Delta m_{\text{in}} = \frac{-m_1 U_2 + m_1 U_1 + Q_{R,12}}{U_2 - h_{\text{in}}}
\]  

Final calculation yields:  
\[
\Delta m_{\text{in}} = 3924.29 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) of saturated liquid water added is approximately \( 3924.29 \, \text{kg} \).
