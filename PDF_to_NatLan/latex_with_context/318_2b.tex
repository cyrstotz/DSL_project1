The problem involves calculating the outlet velocity \( w_6 \) and temperature \( T_6 \).  

The entropy values are given as \( S_5 = S_6 \). The pressure at state 6 is provided:  
\[
p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}.
\]  

The temperature ratio is calculated using the isentropic relation:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left(\frac{p_6}{p_5}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \implies T_6 = \left(\frac{p_6}{p_5}\right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} \cdot T_5.
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = \left(\frac{p_6}{p_5}\right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} \cdot T_5 = 32.07 \, \text{K}.
\]  

The outlet velocity is given as:  
\[
w_6 = 220 \, \text{m/s}.
\]  

Additional note: "Durchschnitt Dose" (average value) is written near the temperature calculation.
