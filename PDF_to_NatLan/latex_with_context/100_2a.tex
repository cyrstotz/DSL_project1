A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn. The diagram shows the thermodynamic process of the jet engine with labeled states (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The curve includes isentropic compression (1 to 2), isobaric heat addition (2 to 3), adiabatic expansion (3 to 4), and mixing (4 to 5).  

No additional explanation is provided for the diagram.
