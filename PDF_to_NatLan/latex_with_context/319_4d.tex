The coefficient of performance (\(\epsilon_K\)) is defined as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
This is further expressed as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{m} (h_2 - h_1)}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  

A small diagram is drawn showing a curve in the \(p\)-\(T\) space, with annotations indicating the phase transitions and a marked point labeled as "state 1."  

Descriptions of diagrams are provided in detail above.
