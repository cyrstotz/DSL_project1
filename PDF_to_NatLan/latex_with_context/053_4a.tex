A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn. The diagram shows the freeze-drying process with labeled states:  
- State \( 1i \) is at low pressure and temperature.  
- State \( 2i \) shows an increase in temperature while maintaining low pressure.  
- State \( 3i \) represents high pressure and temperature.  
- State \( 4i \) returns to low pressure and temperature.  

The diagram includes arrows indicating the transitions between states and labels for the axes:  
- \( p \) [bar] on the vertical axis.  
- \( T \) [K] on the horizontal axis.
