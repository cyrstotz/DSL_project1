The mass flow rate of the refrigerant (\( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \)) is calculated using the energy balance in the compressor:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_e - h_a) - \dot{W}_K
\]  
Rearranging for \( \dot{m} \):  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_e - h_a}
\]  
Given:  
\[
\dot{W}_K = 28 \, \text{W}
\]  

Additional notes:  
- \( \dot{W}_K = 25 \, \text{W} \) is mentioned separately.  
- \( h_e \) and \( h_a \) are to be obtained from Table A-11.  
- \( h_e \) is left undefined in the transcription.
