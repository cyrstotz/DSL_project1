A graph is drawn showing the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The axes are labeled as \( p \, [\text{mbar}] \) for pressure and \( T \, [\text{K}] \) for temperature. The graph includes four distinct states labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4, connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
- State 1 starts at low pressure and low temperature.  
- State 2 shows an increase in temperature while maintaining low pressure.  
- State 3 indicates a significant increase in pressure and temperature.  
- State 4 returns to lower pressure while maintaining high temperature.
