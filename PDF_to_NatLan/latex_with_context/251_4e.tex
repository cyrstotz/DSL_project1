No content related to the evolution of \(T_i\) in Step ii is visible on the page.  

Descriptions of diagrams and partial calculations are provided, but some values are incomplete or crossed out.

The temperature \( T_i \) would decrease slightly and then remain constant as dissipation occurs until equilibrium is reached.  

No diagrams or additional figures are present on the page.
