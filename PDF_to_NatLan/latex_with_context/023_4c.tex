The enthalpy at state 1 is given as:  
\[
h_1 = h_f
\]  
The enthalpy at state 4 is calculated as:  
\[
h_4 = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x \) is determined using the formula:  
\[
x = \frac{h_g - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
Arrows indicate the calculation steps for \( h_f \) and \( h_g \).
