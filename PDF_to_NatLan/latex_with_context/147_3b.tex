The pressure \(p_{g,2}\) equals \(p_{g,1}\) because the piston mass and ambient pressure remain unchanged.  

Since ice is still present in state 2 (\(x_{\text{ice},2} > 0\)), thermodynamic equilibrium ensures the temperature of the gas matches that of the ice-water mixture, which is \(0^\circ\text{C}\) or \(273.15 \, \text{K}\).
