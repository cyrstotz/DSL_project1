If \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), this means that \( T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

Since the EW (ice-water mixture) and the gas are in thermodynamic equilibrium, the gas temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is also \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) can also be found using the ideal gas law:  
\[
pV = mRT
\]  
However, it is not needed for this calculation.
