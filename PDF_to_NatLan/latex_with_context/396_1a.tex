The problem setup involves a reactor operating in steady-state conditions. The given parameters are:  
- Inlet mass flow rate: \( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \)  
- Inlet temperature: \( T_{\text{in}} = 70^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Inlet steam quality: \( x_{\text{in}} = 0.005 \)  
- Outlet temperature: \( T_{\text{out}} = 100^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Outlet steam quality: \( x_{\text{out}} = 0.005 \)  
- Reactor mass: \( m_{\text{total}} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \)  
- Steam quality in the reactor: \( x_D = 0.005 \)  
- Reactor temperature: \( T_{R,1} = 100^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Heat released by the chemical reaction: \( \dot{Q}_R = 100 \, \text{kW} \)  

The energy balance equation for the reactor is written as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (h_e - h_a) - \dot{m}_{\text{out}}
\]  
This equation is modified to include the heat released by the reaction:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_R + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  

The heat flow removed by the coolant, \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \), is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (h_a - h_e) - \dot{Q}_R  
\]  
Substituting values, \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 62.297 \, \text{kW} \).  

The enthalpy values are determined using steam tables:  
\[
h_e = x_{\text{in}} h_g + (1 - x_{\text{in}}) h_f = 304.649 \, \text{kJ/kg}  
\]  
\[
h_a = x_{\text{out}} h_g + (1 - x_{\text{out}}) h_f = 430.325 \, \text{kJ/kg}  
\]  

A small diagram is included, showing the reactor with labeled inlet (\( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \)), outlet (\( \dot{m}_{\text{out}} \)), and heat flow (\( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \)).
