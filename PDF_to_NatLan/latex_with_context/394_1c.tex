The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is calculated based on the heat transfer between the reactor and the cooling jacket.  

A diagram is drawn showing \( T_{\text{KF}} \) increasing \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \), with arrows indicating heat flow from the reactor to the coolant.  

The entropy production is given by:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{Reactor}}}
\]  

From the calculation:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 46.15 \, \text{W/K}
\]
