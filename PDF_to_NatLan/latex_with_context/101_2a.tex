A table is presented with columns labeled \( p \), \( T \), and \( S \). The rows correspond to states 0 through 6, with the following observations:  
- State 1: \( p < p_c \).  
- State 2: \( S_2 = S_1 \).  
- State 3: \( T > T_2 \).  
- State 5: \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  
- State 6: \( S_5 = S_6 \).  

Below the table, a graph is drawn with temperature \( T \, [\text{K}] \) on the vertical axis and entropy \( S \, [\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}] \) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts the thermodynamic process of a jet engine with labeled states (1 through 6) and transitions:  
- State 1 to 2: Isentropic compression.  
- State 2 to 3: Isobaric heating.  
- State 3 to 4: Isothermal process.  
- State 4 to 5: Isobaric cooling.  
- State 5 to 6: Isentropic expansion.  

The graph also includes annotations such as "steeper than isobar" and "adiabatic."
