A graph is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents pressure (\(p\)) in bar, ranging from 1 bar to 8 bar.  
- The horizontal axis represents temperature (\(T\)) in Kelvin (\(K\)).  

The graph depicts a cycle with four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- State 1 is at low pressure and low temperature.  
- State 2 is at low pressure and higher temperature.  
- State 3 is at high pressure and high temperature.  
- State 4 is at high pressure and lower temperature.  

The cycle forms a closed loop, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
