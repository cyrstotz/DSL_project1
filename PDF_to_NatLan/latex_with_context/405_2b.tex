A \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn to represent the thermodynamic process of the jet engine.  

- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \) (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}] \) (specific entropy).  
- The process starts at state 0 and follows a curved line to state 2.  
- From state 2, the process moves upward to state \( p_2 \), then downward to state G.  
- The process continues to state S, then to state 5, and finally to state 6, which is connected back to \( p_0 \).  
- The diagram includes arrows to indicate the direction of the process.  

This diagram qualitatively represents the thermodynamic cycle of the jet engine, including compression, heat addition, expansion, and exhaust.

The temperature \( T_6 \) for an ideal gas is calculated using the equation:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
Substituting values, \( T_6 = 328.075 \, \text{K} \).

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is determined using the energy balance:  
\[
h_e + \frac{w_e^2}{2} = h_a + \frac{w_a^2}{2}
\]  
\[
h_5 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} = h_6 + \frac{w_6^2}{2}
\]  
Rearranging for \( w_6 \):  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2(h_5 - h_6) + w_5^2}
\]  
Substituting values, \( w_6 = 507.94 \, \text{m/s} \).

The enthalpy difference \( h_5 - h_6 \) is calculated as:  
\[
h_5 - h_6 = \int_{T_5}^{T_6} c_p \, dT
\]  
Approximated as:  
\[
h_5 - h_6 = c_p (T_5 - T_6) = 104667.95 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}
\]
