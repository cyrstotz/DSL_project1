Initial state:  
\[
T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C}, \quad V_{g,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L}, \quad p_{g,1} = 1.38397 \, \text{bar}.
\]  
Final state:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C}.
\]  

The system is closed, and work \( W = 0 \). The gas mass remains constant:  
\[
m_2 = m_1.
\]  

The heat transferred \( Q \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1).
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
Q = 3.92 \, \text{g} \cdot 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \cdot (0^\circ\text{C} - 500^\circ\text{C}) = -1082.63 \, \text{J}.
\]  

This heat is absorbed by the ice-water mixture, melting some ice.
