The enthalpy at state 2 is defined as \( h_2(x_2 = 1, s_3) \).  
The enthalpy at state 3 is given as:  
\[
h_3 = 264.15 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The enthalpy at state 4 is calculated using:  
\[
h_4 = h_1 = (u_4 \, \text{at 8 bar}) = 83.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is determined using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f(p_1)}{u_g - u_f}
\]
