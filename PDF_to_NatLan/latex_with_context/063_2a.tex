The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) plot representing the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis (in Kelvin), and the entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis (in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)). The process includes labeled states:  
- State 0 (ambient conditions)  
- State 1 (after compression)  
- State 2 (bypass/core split)  
- State 3 (combustion)  
- State 4 (turbine exit)  
- State 5 (mixer exit)  
- State 6 (nozzle exit).  

The diagram shows isobaric and adiabatic processes, with arrows indicating the flow direction. The combustion process is highlighted as a significant increase in temperature.
