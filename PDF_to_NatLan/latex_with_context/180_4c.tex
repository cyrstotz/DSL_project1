The following relationships are written:  
\[
s_4 = s_1
\]  
\[
p_4 = p_1
\]  

At \(s_4\) and 8 bar, \(x = 0\), the entropy is:  
\[
s_4 = 0.3455 \, \text{kJ/kg路K}
\]  

The vapor quality \(x_1\) is calculated using:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{s_1 - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]  
Where:  
- \(T_1 = 263.15 \, \text{K}\)  
- \(s_f = 0.1583 \, \text{kJ/kg路K}\)  
- \(s_g = 0.5235 \, \text{kJ/kg路K}\)  

Intermediate calculations are shown:  
\[
s_1 = 0.3253 \, \text{kJ/kg路K}
\]  
\[
x_1 = \frac{0.3253 - 0.1583}{0.5235 - 0.1583} = 0.4773
\]  

The final vapor quality is:  
\[
x = 0.4773
\]
