The ice fraction in state 2, \( x_{\text{ice},2} \), is calculated as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{m_{\text{ice},2}}{m_{\text{EW},2}}
\]  
where:  
\[
m_{\text{EW},2} = m_{\text{EW},1}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{m_{\text{ice},2}}{0.1 \, \text{kg}}
\]  

The mass of ice in state 2, \( m_{\text{ice},2} \), remains undefined in the visible content.  

No further calculations or explanations are provided for \( m_{\text{ice},2} \).
