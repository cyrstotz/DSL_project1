The explanation states that less heat \( Q \) is transferred to the ice-water mixture as the temperature approaches \( 0^\circ\text{C} \). This is because the exergy of the system decreases as the temperature gradient diminishes.  

The final pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.160015 \, \text{bar}
\]  

No diagrams or figures are present on the page.

The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is determined using the following equation:  
\[
- m_{\text{EW}} \cdot 0.6 \cdot U_{\text{fresh}}(T_2) + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot x_{\text{ice},2} \cdot U_{\text{fresh}}(T_2) + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (1 - x_{\text{ice},2}) \cdot U_{\text{fossils}}(T_2) - Q_{12} = 0
\]  

This equation balances the energy contributions from the ice fraction, the water fraction, and the heat transfer \( Q_{12} \).
