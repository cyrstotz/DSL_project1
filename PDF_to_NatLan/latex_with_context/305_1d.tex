The energy balance during cooling is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \Delta m_{12} h_{12} + Q_{\text{out},12} = \Delta U
\]  

Expanding further:  
\[
(m_{\text{total}} + \Delta m_{12}) u_2 - m_{\text{total}} u_1 = -\Delta m_{12} u_{12} = Q_{\text{out},12}
\]  

The specific internal energy \( u_1 \) is defined as:  
\[
u_1 = u_f(T)
\]  

(Note: The calculation is incomplete and stops here.)
