A graph is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram. The diagram includes labeled phase regions and process steps.  
- The curve labeled "Mass dampfgebiet" (wet steam region) separates the saturated liquid and vapor phases.  
- Four states are marked:  
  - State 1 is at the lower left, near the saturated liquid line.  
  - State 2 is slightly above State 1, along the same pressure line.  
  - State 3 is higher on the diagram, indicating increased pressure.  
  - State 4 is horizontally aligned with State 3, showing isobaric condensation.  
- Heat transfer (\(Q = q\)) is indicated along the process paths.
