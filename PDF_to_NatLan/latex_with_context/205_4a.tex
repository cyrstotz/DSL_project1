The diagram is a qualitative representation of the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. It includes labeled phase regions and key states.  
- The vertical axis represents pressure \( p \) in bar.  
- The horizontal axis represents temperature \( T \) in degrees Celsius.  
- The diagram shows a curve separating phase regions, with labeled points:  
  - State 1 is in the vapor region.  
  - State 2 is at the saturated vapor line.  
  - State 3 is in the liquid region.  
  - State 4 is also in the liquid region.  
Arrows indicate transitions between states, with processes such as compression and expansion marked.
