The entropy change of the reactor contents is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S = \int T \, dS
\]

The task involves calculating the mass-specific exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) in the engine.  

The student begins with the exergy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \sum \dot{m} \cdot ex_{\text{flow}} - \dot{Q} \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) - \dot{W} - ex_{\text{dest}}
\]  

From this, the exergy destruction is isolated:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = \sum \dot{m} \cdot ex_{\text{flow}} - \dot{Q} \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) - \dot{W}
\]  

The student calculates the exergy destruction using the given data:  
- \( T_0 = 223.15 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( T = 1289 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( \dot{m}_K = 4 \, \text{kg/s} \)  
- \( q_B = 1195 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

The calculation proceeds as follows:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = 4 \cdot 1195 - 4 \cdot 1195 \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{223.15}{1289} \right)
\]  

The result is:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = 496.58 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Additional notes:  
- The student emphasizes that the calculation aligns with the exergy destruction equation and uses the provided parameters consistently.  
- Some intermediate steps and crossed-out calculations are ignored as per instructions.
