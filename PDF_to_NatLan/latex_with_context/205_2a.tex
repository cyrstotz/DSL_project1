A temperature-entropy (\(T\)-\(s\)) diagram is drawn. The diagram shows a qualitative representation of the jet engine process. The following points are labeled:  
- Point 1: Initial state.  
- Point 2: Compression process.  
- Point 3: Combustion process.  
- Point 4: Expansion process in the turbine.  
- Point 5: Mixing chamber state.  
- Point 6: Nozzle exit state.  

The diagram includes curved lines representing isobars, with labels such as \(0.5 \, \text{bar}\) and \(0.191 \, \text{bar}\). The arrows indicate the direction of the thermodynamic processes. The axes are labeled as \(T \, [\text{K}]\) for temperature and \(s \, [\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}]\) for entropy.
