A graph is drawn representing a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars \( p_0 \) and \( p_5 \), with states 1, 5, and 6 marked. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis in Kelvin (K).  
- \( s \) (specific entropy) on the horizontal axis in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \).
