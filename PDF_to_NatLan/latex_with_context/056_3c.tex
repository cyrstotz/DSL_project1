The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is calculated using the heat transfer equation:  
\[
\Delta U = Q
\]  

The heat transfer \( Q \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q = m_{\text{EW}} c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
where \( T_2 \) and \( T_1 \) are the final and initial temperatures, respectively.  

The heat transferred to the ice-water mixture is given as:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1.469 \, \text{MJ}
\]

Given \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \):  
The temperature of the gas decreases as heat flows into the ice-water mixture (EW). However, the pressure remains constant because equilibrium depends on the external pressure.  

The equilibrium point shifts to a new state.
