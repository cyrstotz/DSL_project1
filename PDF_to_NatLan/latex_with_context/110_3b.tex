The problem now addresses the equilibrium state where \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), and the gas and ice-water mixture reach thermal equilibrium.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to \( T_{\text{EW},2} \), and the gas pressure \( p_{g,2} \) remains the same as \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.2885 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The ideal gas law is applied again:  
\[
p V = R T
\]  
Rearranging for \( V_a \):  
\[
V_a = \frac{R T}{p}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
V_a = \frac{0.16628 \, \text{J/g·K} \cdot (500 + 273.15) \, \text{K}}{1.2885 \, \text{bar}}
\]  
Converting units and simplifying:  
\[
V_a = \frac{0.16628 \, \text{J/g·K} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K}}{128850 \, \text{Pa}}
\]  
\[
V_a = 0.997745 \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg}
\]  

Additional equations and derivations related to the pressure-volume relationship are written but not fully resolved.
