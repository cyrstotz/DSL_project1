The expression for the specific flow exergy (\(ex_{\text{str}}\)) is given as:  
\[
ex_{\text{str}} = (h - h_0 - T_0(s - s_0) + \text{ke} + \text{pe})
\]  
where \(h\) is enthalpy, \(s\) is entropy, \(T_0\) is the reference temperature, \(ke\) is kinetic energy, and \(pe\) is potential energy.  

Another form of the specific flow exergy is written as:  
\[
ex_{\text{str}} = (h_0 - h - T_0(s_0 - s)) + \frac{w^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2}
\]  
where \(w\) and \(w_0\) represent velocities at different states.
