The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated using the given energy balance and thermodynamic properties.  

The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) is given as:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (u_1 - u_2) = 0.85 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The difference in specific internal energy is:  
\[
u_1 - u_2 = 8.5 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The specific internal energy at state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
u_1 = u_{\text{ice}}(0^\circ\text{C}) + 0.6 \cdot (u_{\text{liq}}(0^\circ\text{C}) - u_{\text{ice}}(0^\circ\text{C})) = -333.458 + 0.6 \cdot (-0.045 + 333.458) = -133.4102 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The specific internal energy at state 2 is:  
\[
u_2 = -191.97 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = \frac{-191.97 + 333.442}{-0.053 + 333.442} = 0.574
\]  

The final ice fraction is \( x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.574 \).
