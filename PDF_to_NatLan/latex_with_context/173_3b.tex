Determine \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \).

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) because the system is still in equilibrium and the gas has reached thermal equilibrium with the ice-water mixture.  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \), as the force exerted by the piston remains unchanged. Therefore:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 140094 \, \text{Pa}
\]  

This is because the atmospheric pressure \( p_{\text{atm}} \), the piston mass \( m_K \), and the ice-water mass \( m_{\text{EW}} \) remain constant.
