The gas pressure in state 2 is given as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 140.1 \, \text{kPa}
\]  
The mass of the EW, piston, and form do not change.  

Thermodynamic equilibrium is established:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  
The pressure of the EW in state 2 is calculated:  
\[
p_{\text{EW},2} = p_0 + \frac{m_K g}{A} = 139.97 \, \text{kPa} = 1.3997 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Interpolating using Table 1:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ \text{C}
\]
