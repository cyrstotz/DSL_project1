The graph is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram. The vertical axis represents pressure (\(p\)), and the horizontal axis represents temperature (\(T\)). The graph includes a curve that starts at low pressure and temperature, increasing steadily. Around \(T = 10\), there is a sharp vertical line indicating a phase change or transition. The axes are labeled, with pressure ranging from 1 to 10 and temperature ranging from -10 to 10.
