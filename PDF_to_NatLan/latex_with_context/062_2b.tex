The outlet temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the isentropic relation:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) is derived from the energy balance:  
\[
w_6^2 = 2 \left( h_5 - h_6 \right) + w_5^2
\]  
where \( h_5 \) and \( h_6 \) are specific enthalpies at states 5 and 6, respectively, and \( w_5 \) is the velocity at state 5.  

Further derivations and calculations are partially crossed out and unclear.
