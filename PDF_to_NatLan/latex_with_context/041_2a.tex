The process is drawn qualitatively in a \( T \)-\( S \) diagram. The diagram shows the thermodynamic process of the jet engine with labeled isobars and states. Key features include:  
- State 0: Ambient conditions (\( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)).  
- State 1: Isentropic compression.  
- State 2: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 3: Reversible adiabatic expansion.  
- State 5: Mixing chamber (\( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)).  
- State 6: Nozzle exit (\( p_6 = p_0 \)).  

The diagram includes arrows indicating the direction of processes, labeled states (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6), and regions for bypass (\( \dot{m}_M \)) and core (\( \dot{m}_K \)) streams. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin) and \( S \) (entropy in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)).
