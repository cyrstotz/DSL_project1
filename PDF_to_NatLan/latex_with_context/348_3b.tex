Given \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \):  
The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) must remain constant at equilibrium with the ice-water mixture.  

Thermal equilibrium in state 2 implies:  
The temperatures are equal:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  
This is because the system is at the melting point of ice and water in equilibrium.
