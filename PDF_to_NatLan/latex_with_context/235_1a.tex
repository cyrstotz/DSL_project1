Energy balance for the cooling jacket:  

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_i \dot{m}_i \left( h_i + \text{KE}_i + \text{PE}_i \right) + \sum_j \dot{Q}_j - \sum_n \dot{W}_n
\]

The terms for kinetic energy (\( \text{KE}_i \)) and potential energy (\( \text{PE}_i \)) are crossed out, indicating they are negligible. Additionally, the process is labeled as "isobar," meaning it occurs at constant pressure.  

Simplified energy balance:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} \left( h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{aus}} \right) + \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}}
\]  

Here, \( \dot{m} \) represents the mass flow rate, \( h_{\text{in}} \) and \( h_{\text{aus}} \) are the specific enthalpies at the inlet and outlet, respectively, and \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \) is the heat flow removed.
