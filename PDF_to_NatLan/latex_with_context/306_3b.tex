Since we assume that solid/liquid water is incompressible and the density difference is negligible, the pressure in state 2 is equal to the pressure in state 1:  
\[
p_{\text{g,2}} = p_{\text{g,1}} = 1.5 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The temperature of the gas in state 2 is equal to the temperature in state 1:  
\[
T_{\text{g,2}} = T_{\text{g,1}} = 500^\circ \text{C}
\]
