The energy balance between the ice-water mixture (EW) and the gas is expressed as:  
\[
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12}.
\]

Expanding the energy balance:  
\[
m_g \cdot U_2 - m_g \cdot U_1 = Q_{12}.
\]

The heat transferred is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = 80.0036 \, \text{kg} \cdot \left[ u(0.0034 \, \text{m}^3, 1.15 \, \text{bar}) - u(500^\circ\text{C}, 1 \, \text{bar}) \right].
\]
