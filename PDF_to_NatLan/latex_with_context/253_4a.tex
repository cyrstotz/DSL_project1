A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a phase diagram with labeled points corresponding to states in the refrigeration cycle:  
- Point 1 is in the liquid region.  
- Point 2 and Point 4 are on the saturation curve.  
- Point 3 is in the superheated vapor region.  
Arrows indicate the transitions between states, showing the process flow:  
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1.
