The exergy balance equation is provided as:  
\[
0 = \sum \dot{E}_{x,\text{str}}(t) + \sum \dot{E}_{x,Q}(t) - \sum \dot{W}_n(t) - \dot{E}_{x,\text{verl}}(t)
\]  
where \(\dot{E}_{x,\text{str}}\) is the exergy flow rate, \(\dot{E}_{x,Q}\) is the exergy associated with heat transfer, \(\dot{W}_n\) is the work rate, and \(\dot{E}_{x,\text{verl}}\) is the exergy destruction rate.  

The exergy destruction rate is further expressed as:  
\[
\dot{E}_{x,\text{verl}} = \dot{E}_{x,\text{str}} + \dot{E}_{x,Q}(t) - \sum \dot{W}_n(t)
\]
