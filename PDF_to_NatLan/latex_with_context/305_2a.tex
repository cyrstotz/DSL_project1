Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. **T-s Diagram**:  
   - The diagram shows temperature (\( T \)) on the vertical axis and entropy (\( s \)) on the horizontal axis.  
   - Several isobaric lines are labeled, including \( 0.13 \, \text{bar} \).  
   - The process path is marked with points \( 0 \), \( 1 \), and \( 2 \).  
   - The path from \( 0 \) to \( 1 \) is labeled as "isentropic," and the path from \( 1 \) to \( 2 \) is labeled as "isobaric."  

2. **T-s Diagram with Additional States**:  
   - This diagram also shows temperature (\( T \)) on the vertical axis and entropy (\( s \)) on the horizontal axis.  
   - Several isobaric lines are labeled, including \( 0.019 \, \text{bar} \).  
   - The process path includes points \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2k \), \( 3k \), \( 4k \), and \( 5 \).  
   - The path from \( 0 \) to \( 1 \) is labeled as "isentropic," and the path from \( 1 \) to \( 2k \) is labeled as "isobaric."  
   - Additional paths are labeled "isentropic" and "isobaric" between other points.
