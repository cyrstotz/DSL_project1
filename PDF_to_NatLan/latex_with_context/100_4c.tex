The triple point temperature difference is given as \( 10 \, \text{K} \) in the sublimation range.  

Equations:  
- \( T_1 = T_{\text{triple}} + 10 \, \text{K} = 283.15 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( T_2 = T_{\text{triple}} + 10 \, \text{K} - 6 \, \text{K} \)  
  \[
  T_2 = 277.15 \, \text{K}
  \]  

The temperature \( T_2 \) is selected as \( T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C} \).  

Using Table A10:  
- \( s_2 = 0.9351 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \), \( h_2 = 251.8 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  
- \( s_3 = 0.5351 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \)

The pressure \( p \) is given as \( p_1 = 1.219 \, \text{bar} \) (from Table A10).  

The enthalpy \( h_1 \) is equal to \( h_{\text{ev}} \).  

The vapor quality \( x \) is calculated using:  
\[
x = \frac{h_4 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x = 0.39
\]
