To determine \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \):  

The pressure between the gas and the ice-water mixture remains balanced because the piston ensures equilibrium.  

Thus:  
\[
p_1 = p_2
\]  
This means the pressure does not change between states 1 and 2.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is determined by the thermal equilibrium with the ice-water mixture.  

The ratio of specific heats is given as:  
\[
\kappa = \frac{c_p}{c_v}
\]  

No further calculations are provided for \( \kappa \).
