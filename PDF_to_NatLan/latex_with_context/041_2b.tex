The energy balance for the process from state 5 to state 6 is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m}_{\text{mix}} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right] + \sum_i \dot{Q}_i - \sum_n \dot{W}_{\text{turbine},n}.
\]  

For steady-state operation, the equation simplifies to:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{mix}} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right] - \dot{W}_v.
\]  

The enthalpy difference \( h_6 - h_5 \) is expressed as:  
\[
h_6 - h_5 = \int_{T_5}^{T_6} c_p \, dT = c_p (T_6 - T_5).
\]  

Additional considerations include:  
- \( T_6 \) is unknown and needs to be determined.  
- The process is modeled as an ideal gas.  

Entropy balance is also noted:  
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = \sum_i \dot{m}_i s_i + \sum_i \frac{\dot{Q}_i}{T_i}.
\]  

For steady-state and adiabatic conditions:  
\[
0 = m (s_5 - s_6) \quad \text{(isentropic process)}.
\]  

Exergy balance is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE_{\text{ex}}}{dt} = \sum_i \dot{E}_{\text{ex,in},i} + \sum_i \dot{E}_{\text{ex,out},i} - \sum_n \dot{W}_{n} - \dot{E}_{\text{ex,rev}}.
\]  

For steady-state operation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{mix}} \left[ h_6 - h_5 - T_0 (s_6 - s_5) + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right] - \dot{W}_v.
