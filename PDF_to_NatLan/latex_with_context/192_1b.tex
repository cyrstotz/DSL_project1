The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is derived for an ideal fluid:  
\[
T = \frac{h_a - h_e}{s_a - s_e}
\]  
It is noted that there is no pressure change (\( p = \text{const} \)).  

The integral form is given:  
\[
T = \frac{\int_{T_1}^{T_2} c \, dT}{\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \frac{c}{T} \, dT}
\]  
where \( c \) is constant.

The heat capacity \( c \) is constant. The thermodynamic mean temperature \( \bar{T} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\bar{T} = \frac{(T_2 - T_1)}{\ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)}
\]  
where:  
\[
T_2 = 298.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_1 = 288.15 \, \text{K}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\bar{T} = 293.12 \, \text{K}
\]
