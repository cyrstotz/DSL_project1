The process is illustrated in a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. The diagram shows the thermodynamic process of a jet engine, with labeled points \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), and \( 5 \). The curve begins at \( 0 \), rises to \( 3 \), and descends through \( 4 \) and \( 5 \). The axes are labeled as \( T [K] \) for temperature and \( s [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}] \) for entropy.
