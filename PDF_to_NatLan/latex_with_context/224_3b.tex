The volume of the EW in state 2 is given as:  
\[
V_{\text{EW},2} = V_{\text{EW},1}
\]  

The pressure in state 2 remains constant:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

It is stated that \( m_{\text{EW}} \), \( m_K \), and \( p_{\text{amb}} \) do not change.  

The temperature in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
T_{g,2} = \frac{p_{g,2} V_{g,2} M_g}{m_g R}
\]
