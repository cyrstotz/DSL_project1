The initial ice fraction is \( x_1 = 0.6 \).  

The energy balance for the ice-water mixture is:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{Q} + \dot{W} = 0
\]  
where \( V_{\text{EW}} = \text{const} \).  

The heat transferred is:  
\[
Q = 1 Q_{12}
\]  

The change in internal energy is:  
\[
\Delta U = Q_{12}
\]  

The mass-specific internal energy is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}} + u_1 = -185.1 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The ice fraction at state 2 is determined using the equilibrium table and the energy balance.
