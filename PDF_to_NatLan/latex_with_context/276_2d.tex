The calculation for exergy destruction begins with the formula:  
\[
ex_{\text{verl}} = \frac{\dot{S}_{\text{erz}} - T_0}{m_{\text{gas}}}
\]  

Entropy balance:  
The entropy generation rate \( \dot{S}_{\text{erz}} \) is derived from:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{erz}} = \dot{m} \left[ s_6 - s_0 \right]
\]  
where \( s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) \).  

After substituting all values and performing the calculations, the final result is:  
\[
ex_{\text{verl}} = 82.01 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
