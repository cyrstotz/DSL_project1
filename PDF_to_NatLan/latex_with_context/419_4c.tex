At \( 8 \, \text{bar} \), interpolation is performed using tabulated values:  
\[
s_2 = 0.9226, \quad s_{\text{sat}} = 0.8066, \quad s_{40} = 0.9376
\]  
Interpolating for \( h_3 \):  
\[
h_3 = 264.75 + \frac{0.9276 - 0.8066}{0.9376 - 0.8066} \cdot (283.15 - 264.75)
\]  
\[
h_3 = 268.82 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is given by:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{s_1 - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]
