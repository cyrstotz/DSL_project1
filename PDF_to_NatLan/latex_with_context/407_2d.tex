The state process is described with the following equation:  
\[
\frac{2}{z_M - z_K} \cdot \left( h_M - h_K \right) \cdot v_d = \frac{2}{z_M - z_K} \cdot \int_{0}^{\infty} v_d \, dp
\]

The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated using:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]

Additional calculations for \( ex_{\text{flow}} \) and \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) are shown using integrals and logarithmic relationships between temperatures.
