The entropy balance for a semi-open system is expressed as:  

\[
\Delta S = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1 = \Delta m s_{\text{out}} + \sum \frac{Q}{T} + S_{\text{gen}}
\]  

Where:  
- \( \Delta S \) represents the change in entropy.  
- \( m_2 s_2 \) and \( m_1 s_1 \) are the entropy terms for states 2 and 1, respectively.  
- \( \Delta m s_{\text{out}} \) accounts for the entropy associated with mass flow leaving the system.  
- \( \sum \frac{Q}{T} \) is the sum of heat transfer terms divided by temperature.  
- \( S_{\text{gen}} \) is the entropy generated within the system.
