The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The graph is labeled with states \( 0 \) through \( 6 \), showing the thermodynamic process steps.  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  
- The process includes isobaric and adiabatic transformations, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
- States \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \) are marked, with isobaric lines labeled accordingly.
