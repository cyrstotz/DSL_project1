The mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated.  

The following equations are provided:  
1. Flow exergy difference:  
   \[
   \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_{\text{flow},6} - ex_{\text{flow},0}
   \]  

2. Substituting the expression for flow exergy:  
   \[
   \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + k_{e6} - k_{e0}
   \]  

3. Kinetic energy at state 6:  
   \[
   k_{e6} = \frac{1}{2} w_6^2
   \]
