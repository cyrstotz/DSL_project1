The reactor operates under steady-state conditions. The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}}) + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  
where \( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} = \dot{m}_{\text{out}} \).  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}}) + \dot{Q}_R
\]
