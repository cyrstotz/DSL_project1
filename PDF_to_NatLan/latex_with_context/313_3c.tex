The system is stationary, so the energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ s_2 - s_1 \right] + 2 \dot{Q} + \dot{m} s_{\text{oz}}
\]  
The entropy flow rate of the gas is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{s}_{\text{oz}} = \frac{65000 \, \text{W}}{255 \, \text{K}} = 220.3 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{KÂ·s}}
\]

For a closed system, the energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = 0
\]
