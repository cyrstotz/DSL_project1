The diagram shows a pressure-temperature (\( p(T) \)) graph with phase regions labeled. The graph includes the following features:  
- A curve representing the phase boundary between liquid and vapor.  
- The region labeled "unterk체hlte Fl체ssigkeit" (subcooled liquid) is below the curve.  
- The region labeled "Massedampf" (wet vapor) is along the curve.  
- The region labeled "체bers채ttigter Dampf" (superheated vapor) is above the curve.
