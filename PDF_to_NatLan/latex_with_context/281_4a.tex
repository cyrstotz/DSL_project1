A graph is drawn with pressure (\( p \)) on the vertical axis and temperature (\( T \)) in degrees Celsius on the horizontal axis. The graph represents a refrigeration cycle with four labeled states: 1, 2, 3, and 4. The cycle forms a closed loop, with state 1 and state 2 connected by a curve, state 2 and state 3 connected by a straight line, state 3 and state 4 connected by another curve, and state 4 and state 1 connected by a straight line.
