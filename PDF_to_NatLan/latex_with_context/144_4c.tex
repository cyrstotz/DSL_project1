The first law of thermodynamics is applied to different components of the refrigeration cycle:  
1. For the evaporator:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_1 - h_2 \right) + \dot{Q}_K  
\]  
2. For the condenser:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_3 - h_4 \right) + \dot{Q}_{\text{cond}}  
\]  
3. For the compressor:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) - \dot{W}_K  
\]

The mass flow rate is given as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{4 \, \text{kg}}{\text{h}}
\]  
The temperature at state 2 is:  
\[
T_2 = -22^\circ \text{C}
\]  
The pressures are:  
\[
p_1 = p_2 = p_4 = 1.2 \, \text{bar}, \quad p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar}
\]  
(Refer to Table A-10 for data.)  

Using the energy balance for the throttling process:  
\[
h_4 = h_n
\]  
\[
h_n = h_4 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(from Table A-11)}
\]  

The enthalpy at state \( n \) is calculated as:  
\[
h_n = h_f + x_n (h_g - h_f)
\]  
Solving for the vapor quality \( x_n \):  
\[
x_n = \frac{h_n - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = 0.3375
\]
