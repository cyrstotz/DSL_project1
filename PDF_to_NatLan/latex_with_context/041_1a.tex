The energy balance equation for the reactor is written as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} \left[ h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}} \right] + \dot{Q}_R
\]  
where \( h_{\text{in}} \) and \( h_{\text{out}} \) are the specific enthalpies at the inlet and outlet, respectively, and \( \dot{Q}_R \) is the heat released by the chemical reaction.  

The specific enthalpy at the inlet is calculated using water table data (Table A-2):  
\[
h_{\text{in}} = h_f(70^\circ\text{C}) + x \left[ h_g(70^\circ\text{C}) - h_f(70^\circ\text{C}) \right] = 301.65 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The specific enthalpy at the outlet is similarly calculated:  
\[
h_{\text{out}} = h_f(100^\circ\text{C}) + x \left[ h_g(100^\circ\text{C}) - h_f(100^\circ\text{C}) \right] = 430.33 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is determined as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 62.296 \, \text{kW}
\]
