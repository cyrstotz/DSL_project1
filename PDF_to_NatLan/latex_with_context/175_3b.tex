The mass of the gas is recalculated using a different pressure value:  
\[
m = \frac{p_{\text{avg}} \cdot V_1}{R T_1} = \frac{1.15 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \cdot 3.114 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3}{0.16628 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K}} = 3.635 \, \text{g}
\]

The change in energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \sum Q - \sum W
\]  
The work term (\( \dot{W} \)) is zero because the system is incompressible (\( \omega = 0 \)).
