A graph is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (\(p-T\)) diagram. The diagram includes a dome-shaped curve representing the phase boundary between liquid and vapor regions. Two horizontal lines are drawn across the dome, indicating isobaric processes. The x-axis is labeled as \(T\) (temperature), and the y-axis is labeled as \(p\) (pressure).
