The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) in state 2 are determined as follows:  
The external pressure acting on the piston does not change, so:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) in the gas is equal to the temperature in the ice-water mixture (EW) at equilibrium:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  
Thus:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]
