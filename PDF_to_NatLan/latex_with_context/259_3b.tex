The initial gas pressure and mass are given as:  
\[
p_{g,1} = 7.35 \, \text{bar}, \quad m_g = 3.6 \, \text{kg}
\]  
The temperature of the gas is stated as:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  
The relationship between the temperatures and pressures is given by:  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]  
where \( n \) is calculated as:  
\[
n = \frac{c_p}{c_v}
\]  
Using \( c_p = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/(kg·K)} \) and \( c_v = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/(kg·K)} \):  
\[
n = \frac{1.006}{0.633} = 1.00025
\]  
The equation for \( p_2 \) is derived as:  
\[
p_2 = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \cdot p_1
\]  

The explanation states: "The temperature is equal to that of the ice because the ice temperature cannot change when \( x_2 > 0 \)."
