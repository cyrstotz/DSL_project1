A T-s diagram is drawn, showing the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. The diagram includes labeled isobars and states:  
- State 0 is at the bottom left, representing ambient conditions.  
- State 2 is higher on the diagram, connected to state 3 via an isentropic line.  
- State 3 transitions to state 4 via an isobaric line.  
- State 5 is connected to state 6 via an isentropic line.  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The x-axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \).  
- The y-axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin.
