A schematic diagram is drawn, representing the refrigeration cycle.  
- The diagram includes two intersecting triangles, symbolizing the cycle components.  
- Labels indicate the following:  
  - \( m \): mass flow rate  
  - \( \dot{Q}_K \): heat removed  
  - \( \Pi_4 \): pressure at state 4, given as \( 8 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - \( T_4(8 \, \text{bar}) = 31.33^\circ\text{C} \)  
  - \( x = 0 \): vapor quality at state 4  
  - \( p = 8 \, \text{bar} \): pressure
