A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn. The diagram shows the thermodynamic process of a jet engine with labeled states:  
- State 0 represents the ambient condition.  
- State 2 is the compressed air after the compressor.  
- State 3 is the high-temperature state after combustion.  
- State 4 is the turbine outlet.  
- State 5 is the mixed flow after the mixing chamber.  
- State 6 is the nozzle exit.  

The diagram includes isobars labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), and \( p_2 \), with \( p_2 > p_1 > p_0 \). The process lines indicate compression, isobaric combustion, expansion, and mixing.
