A pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) diagram is drawn to represent the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes phase regions and key states labeled as 1, 2, and 3.  
- The curve labeled "Triple" represents the triple point of the substance.  
- State 1 is marked on the curve at a lower temperature and pressure.  
- State 2 is shown at a higher temperature (\(T_z\)) and pressure (\(p_z\)).  
- State 3 is connected to State 2 via a dashed line, indicating an isentropic process.  
The axes are labeled as \(p\) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \(T\) (temperature) on the horizontal axis.

The equation for entropy at state 4 is given as:  
\[
S_4 = S_{1,a} + S_{f4}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x = \frac{S_4 - S_{f4}}{S_{g} - S_{f4}}
\]
