The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) process for a jet engine cycle. The graph is labeled with key states:  
- State 1: Inlet (irreversible process).  
- State 2: Compression (irreversible process).  
- State 3: Combustion (isobaric process).  
- State 4: Expansion (reversible adiabatic process).  
- State 5: Mixing chamber (isobaric process).  
- State 6: Nozzle exit (irreversible process).  

The x-axis is entropy \( s \) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \), and the y-axis is temperature \( T \) in Kelvin. The fluid is labeled as "ideal fluid." The pressure conditions are noted as \( p_4 = p_5 \) and \( p_0 = p_6 \).
