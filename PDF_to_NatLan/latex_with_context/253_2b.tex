The first law of thermodynamics applied to the entire system is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_0 \left( h_0 + \frac{w_{\text{Luft}}^2}{2} \right) - h_6 - \frac{w_6^2}{2}
\]  
Rearranging this equation gives:  
\[
2 \left( h_0 - h_6 + \frac{w_{\text{Luft}}^2}{2} \right) = w_6^2
\]  

The enthalpy difference \( h_0 - h_6 \) is expressed as:  
\[
h_0 - h_6 = c_{p,\text{Luft}} \left( T_0 - T_6 \right)
\]  

The first law of thermodynamics applied to the mixing chamber is noted, but the equation is partially crossed out. The equation suggests:  
\[
T_5 = T_6
\]  

No further explanation or derivation is provided for the mixing chamber.
