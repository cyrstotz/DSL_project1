The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
OE = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_{12} + Q_{\text{out},12}
\]  
The mass change is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} (u_2 - u_1) = \Delta m_{12} h_{12} + Q_{\text{out},12}
\]  

The internal energy values are specified:  
\[
u_2 (x = 0, T = 70^\circ\text{C})
\]  
\[
u_1 (x = x_D)
\]  

From the water tables (Table A2), the following values are provided:  
\[
u_f (100^\circ\text{C}) = 419.294 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \quad \text{(Table A2)}
\]  
\[
u_g (100^\circ\text{C}) = 2506.5 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \quad \text{(Table A2)}
\]  

The internal energy at state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
u_1 = u_f + x_D (u_g - u_f) = 429.3378 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The internal energy at state 2 is specified as:  
\[
u_2 (T = 70^\circ\text{C})
\]  

It is noted that the process is isochoric, meaning:  
\[
V_1 = V_2
\]
