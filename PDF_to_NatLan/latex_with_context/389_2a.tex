A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn, showing the thermodynamic process of the jet engine. The diagram includes labeled isobars at \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) and \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \). The temperature axis ranges from \( -30^\circ\text{C} \) to higher values, and the entropy axis is labeled in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \). States 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the process path.
