The page contains a T-s diagram illustrating the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine. The diagram is labeled with states \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\). The processes are described as follows:  
- Between states \(1\) and \(2\), the process is labeled "reversible adiabatic."  
- Between states \(2\) and \(3\), the process is labeled "isobaric."  
- Between states \(5\) and \(6\), the pressure is noted as \(p_6 = p_0\).  

The x-axis is labeled as entropy (\(s\)), and the y-axis is labeled as temperature (\(T\)). The diagram includes curves and lines representing the thermodynamic paths, with annotations indicating the nature of each process.
