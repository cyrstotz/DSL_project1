The diagram is a T-s diagram (temperature vs. entropy) illustrating the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine. The following processes are labeled:  
- **Isentropic compression**: The curve from state 1 to state 2.  
- **Non-isentropic compression**: A nearby curve also labeled for compression.  
- **Isobaric combustion**: The horizontal line from state 2 to state 3.  
- **Non-isentropic turbine**: The curve from state 3 to state 4.  
- **Isentropic turbine**: A nearby curve also labeled for turbine expansion.  
- **Isobaric mixing**: The horizontal line from state 4 to state 5.  
- **Isentropic nozzle expansion**: The curve from state 5 to state 6.  

The axes are labeled:  
- Vertical axis: \( T \) [K] (temperature).  
- Horizontal axis: \( s \) [\frac{u}{kgK}] (specific entropy).
