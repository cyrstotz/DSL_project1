The page begins with a labeled diagram representing the jet engine process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram includes the following states and transitions:  
- State 0: Ambient conditions (\( p_0 \), \( T_0 \)).  
- State 1: Pre-compressor.  
- State 2: Post-compressor.  
- State 3: Combustion chamber.  
- State 4: Post-turbine.  
- State 5: Mixer.  
- State 6: Nozzle exit.  

The diagram shows isobars and curves for the compression, combustion, and turbine processes. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis.
