The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) plot illustrating the freeze-drying process.  
- The x-axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin, and the y-axis represents pressure (\( p \)) in bar.  
- The curve shows the phase boundaries between different states of the refrigerant.  
- The left side of the curve is labeled "saturated liquid," while the right side is labeled "saturated vapor."  
- The region under the curve is labeled "wet steam" (Nassdampf).  
- The process includes the following steps:  
  - Adiabatic compression (state 1 to state 2).  
  - Isobaric heat transfer (state 2 to state 3).  
  - Adiabatic expansion (state 3 to state 4).
