The equation for the steady-state process in the compressor is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}(h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_t
\]  
For the reversible process:  
\[
s_2 = s_3
\]  
The temperature at state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_2 = T_i + 6 \, \text{K} = 297.15 \, \text{K} = 26^\circ\text{C}
\]  
The pressure at state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
p_2 = 1.0199 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The entropy at state 3 is expressed as:  
\[
s_3 = s_f(8 \, \text{bar}) + x(s_g - s_f)
\]  
Using values from Table A-11:  
\[
x = \frac{s_3 - s_f(8 \, \text{bar})}{s_g(8 \, \text{bar}) - s_f(8 \, \text{bar})}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x = \frac{0.983 - 0.3485}{0.9066 - 0.3485} = 0.337
\]
