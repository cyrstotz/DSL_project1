The thermodynamic equilibrium condition is described:  
\[
\dot{Q} = 0, \quad T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  

For isentropic state changes, the following relationships are used:  
\[
R = c_p - c_v
\]  
\[
n = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = 1.262
\]  

The specific heat capacity \( c_p \) is calculated as:  
\[
c_p = R + c_v = 0.79928 \, \text{kJ/(kgÂ·K)}
\]  

The temperature \( T_2 \) is calculated using the isentropic relation:  
\[
T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]
