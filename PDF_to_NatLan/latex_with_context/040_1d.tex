The energy balance for cooling the reactor from state 1 to state 2 is given by:  
\[
\Delta U = \Delta m \, h_{\text{in,12}} + 35 \, \text{MJ}
\]  

Where:  
- \( \Delta U = m_{\text{total}} \left( u_2 - u_1 \right) \)  
- \( u_2 \) and \( u_1 \) are the specific internal energy values at states 2 and 1, respectively.  
- \( h_{\text{in,12}} \) is the specific enthalpy of the added water.  

From the water tables:  
\[
u_2 = 203.82 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}, \quad u_1 = 929.88 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Substituting these values:  
\[
-693.8 \, \text{MJ} = \Delta m \, h_{\text{in,12}} + 35 \, \text{MJ}
\]  

The enthalpy of the added water is:  
\[
h_{\text{in,12}} = 29.59 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Rearranging to solve for \( \Delta m \):  
\[
\Delta m = \frac{-728.8 \, \text{MJ}}{29.59 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}} = 296.99 \, \text{kg}
\]  

Thus, the mass of saturated liquid water added is:  
\[
\Delta m = 296.99 \, \text{kg}
\]
