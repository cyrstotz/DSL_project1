The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes the following labeled features:  
- A curve labeled "gas" representing the gaseous phase.  
- A point labeled "Triple point," indicating the intersection of phase boundaries.  
- A horizontal line labeled "isobar" and "Filling," representing an isobaric process.  
- A vertical line labeled "isochor," representing an isochoric process.  
- The axes are labeled \(p\) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \(T\) (temperature) on the horizontal axis.
