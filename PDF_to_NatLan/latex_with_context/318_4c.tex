The temperature \( T_2 \) is given as \( -22^\circ\text{C} \).  

The entropy \( s \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
s = s_f + x \cdot (s_g - s_f)
\]  
Rearranging for \( x \):  
\[
x = \frac{s - s_f}{s_g - s_f}
\]  

The entropy at state 3 (\( s_3 \)) is equal to \( s_2 \) because the compression is isentropic.
