The reactor process is isothermal because the mass and steam quality remain constant.  

Energy balance for the reactor:  
\[
Q_{\text{out}} + Q_R = \dot{m} \cdot (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}})
\]  
where \( W = 0 \), as there is no mechanical work or pressure change.  

The inlet temperature is \( T_{\text{in}} = 70^\circ\text{C} \), corresponding to saturated liquid. Using Table A-2:  
\[
h_f(T_{\text{in}} = 70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.98 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The outlet temperature is \( T_{\text{out}} = 100^\circ\text{C} \), also corresponding to saturated liquid. Using Table A-2:  
\[
h_f(T_{\text{out}} = 100^\circ\text{C}) = 419.07 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is:  
\[
Q_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}}) - Q_R = -62.182 \, \text{kW}
\]
