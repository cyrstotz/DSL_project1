The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_{\text{flow},6} - ex_{\text{flow},0}
\]  
The flow exergy at state 6 and state 0 is expressed as:  
\[
ex_{\text{flow},0} = h_6 - h_0 - T_0(s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2}
\]  
Expanding the terms:  
\[
\Delta ex = c_p(T_6 - T_0) - T_0 \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2}
\]  
The temperature \( T_0 \) is given as \( 340 \, \text{K} \), and the velocity \( w_6 \) is \( 150 \, \text{m/s} \).  
The calculated value for \( \Delta ex \) is approximately \( 1100.65 \, \text{J/kg} \), which simplifies to \( 110 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).
