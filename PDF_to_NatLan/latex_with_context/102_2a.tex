The page contains a graph and an equation related to thermodynamic processes.  

**Graph Description:**  
The graph is a \( T \) vs. \( s \) diagram, where \( T \) represents temperature in Kelvin and \( s \) represents specific entropy in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \). The diagram includes labeled isobars and process points:  
- Point 1 is the starting state.  
- Point 2 represents an isentropic compression.  
- Point 3 shows an isobaric heat addition.  
- Point 4 represents an isentropic expansion.  
The isobars are curved lines, and the processes are connected by straight lines between the points.
