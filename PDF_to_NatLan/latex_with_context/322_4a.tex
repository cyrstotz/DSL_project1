Two diagrams are drawn to represent the freeze-drying process.  

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The graph is labeled as \( p(T)_{\text{sur}} \) on the y-axis and \( T \, [K] \) on the x-axis.  
   - It shows phase regions for the refrigerant, including "Gas" and "Fl√ºssig" (liquid).  
   - The curves intersect, indicating phase transitions.  

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - The graph is labeled with \( p \) on the y-axis and \( T \) on the x-axis.  
   - It depicts a typical phase diagram with a dome-shaped curve representing the saturation region.  
   - Points labeled "1" and "2" are marked on the curve, with arrows indicating transitions between states.  
   - The labels "Tripelpunkt" (triple point) and "Gas" are included.
