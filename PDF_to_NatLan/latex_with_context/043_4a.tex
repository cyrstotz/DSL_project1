A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn to represent the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes the following labeled processes:  
- **Isobaric** processes at states 1 and 4.  
- **Isentropic** processes at states 2 and 3.  
- **Adiabatic** processes connecting states 1 to 2 and 3 to 4.  

The diagram shows transitions between states 1, 2, 3, and 4, with arrows indicating the direction of the processes.
