The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is determined using an energy balance.  

The energy balance equation is:  
\[
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
Since \( W_{12} = 0 \), the equation simplifies to:  
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12}
\]  

The internal energy change is expressed as:  
\[
m_g (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
0.0036 \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = Q_{12}
\]  

Using \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \), \( T_2 = 3 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_1 = 500 \, \text{K} \):  
\[
0.0036 \cdot 0.633 \cdot (0.003 - 500) = Q_{12}
\]  

The calculated heat transfer is:  
\[
Q_{12} = -1.13933 \, \text{kJ}
\]
