The energy balance for a closed system is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \sum Q - \sum W
\]  
Expanding the equation:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_{\text{EW}} \left( x U_E + (1 - x) U_W - 0.6 U_E + 0.4 U_W \right)
\]  
Rewriting to solve for \( x \):  
\[
x = \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}} + 0.6 U_E - 0.4 U_W - U_W
\]  
Substituting numerical values:  
\[
x = \frac{1500}{3.6} + 0.6 \cdot (-333) - 0.4 \cdot (0.0045) - (0.0033)
\]  
Intermediate calculations:  
\[
x = -833.442 - 0.033
\]  
Final result:  
\[
x = 0.64965
\]  
Rounded:  
\[
x = 0.650
\]
