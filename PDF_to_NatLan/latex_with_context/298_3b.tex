The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined under the assumption that \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), meaning ice is still present in the system.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is exactly equal to the equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture, which is \( T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} \). Thermal equilibrium is achieved, and no further heat transfer occurs.  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) remains constant because the piston weight and atmospheric pressure remain unchanged, and the system is isolated.
