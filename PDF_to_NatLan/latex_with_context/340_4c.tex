The process is described as adiabatic and reversible, with \( h_3 = h_4 \).  
The enthalpy at state 4 is calculated:  
\[
h_4 = h_{\text{R134a, A10}} - h_3 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) at state 1 is determined using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{93.42 - 29.74}{279.7 - 29.74} = 0.367
\]
