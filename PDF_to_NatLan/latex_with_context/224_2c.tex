The mass-specific increase in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = m_{\text{gas}} \left[ h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} \right]
\]  

Additional assumptions:  
- The process is adiabatic, reversible, and isentropic.  
- \( w_5 = 0 \), \( Q = 0 \).  

No further numerical values are provided for \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \).
