The outlet velocity \( w_c \) is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
w_c = \sqrt{2 \, c_p \, (T_5 - T_0) + \frac{w_5^2}{2}}
\]

The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m}_K + \dot{m}_M = \dot{m}_K (1 + 5.293)
\]

The energy balance for the combustion chamber is given as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_K (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{m}_K \cdot q_B
\]

The heat transfer \( q_B \) is described as:  
\[
-q_B = c_p (T_2 - T_3)
\]

The temperature \( T_2 \) is labeled as "some value."

For the turbine, the energy balance is:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_K \, c_p (T_1 - T_2) + Q_{\text{ext}} \, \frac{W_{\text{ext}}}{\dot{m}_K}
\]
