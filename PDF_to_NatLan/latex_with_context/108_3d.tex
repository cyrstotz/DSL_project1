The ice mass fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is determined.  

The equilibrium temperature for the ice-water mixture is:  
\[
T_{2,\text{EW}} = T_{\text{eq}} = 0.003^\circ \text{C}, \quad p_{\text{EW}} = 1.46 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Using the energy balance for the ice-water mixture:  
\[
\Delta U_{12}^{\text{EW}} = Q_{12}
\]  
The change in internal energy is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta U_{12}^{\text{EW}} = m_{\text{EW}} (U_2 - U_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
U_2 = U_1 + \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{\text{EW}}} = -708.65 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

The ice mass fraction is calculated using:  
\[
x_2 = \frac{U_2 - U_{f,2}}{U_{ice,2} - U_{f,2}}
\]  
Where:  
\[
U_{f,2} = -0.333 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad U_{ice,2} = -333.62 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
x_2 = 0.568
\]  
It is verified that \( x_2 < x_{\text{ice},1} \), which is correct.
