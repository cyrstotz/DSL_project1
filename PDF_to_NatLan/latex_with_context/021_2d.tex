The system boundary is extended over the entire aircraft propulsion system. The exergy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{E}_{\text{in,ver}} = \dot{E}_{\text{ex,str}}
\]

The exergy input is given by:  
\[
\dot{E}_{\text{in,ver}} = T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{ex,2}}
\]

The exergy output is:  
\[
\dot{E}_{\text{ex,ver}} = T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{ex,2}}
\]

The entropy flow rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{ex,2}} = s_6 - s_0
\]

The entropy values (\( s_6 \) and \( s_0 \)) are obtained through interpolation from Table A-22.
