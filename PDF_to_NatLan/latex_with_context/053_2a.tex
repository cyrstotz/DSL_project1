The process is illustrated qualitatively in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram shows the thermodynamic states of the jet engine process, including labeled isobars and entropy changes.  

- The diagram includes states 1 through 6, with arrows indicating the transitions between states.  
- State 1 starts at \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) and \( T_0 = -30^\circ\text{C} \).  
- States 2 and 3 are labeled as \( p_2 \), indicating compression.  
- State 4 is labeled as isobaric combustion.  
- States 5 and 6 are labeled with pressures \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), respectively.  
- The entropy axis is labeled as \( S \, [\frac{u}{T}] \), and the temperature axis is labeled as \( T \, [K] \).
