A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as temperature \( T \) and the y-axis labeled as pressure \( p \). The graph shows phase regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous). There are lines separating the regions, indicating phase boundaries. The graph includes annotations for states 1, 2, 3, and 4, with arrows showing transitions between these states.
