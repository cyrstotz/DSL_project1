The energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta U + \text{KE} + \text{PE} = Q_{12} - W_{12}.
\]  
Neglecting kinetic and potential energy changes, the heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
Q_{12} = c_V (T_2 - T_1) + p \Delta V.
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = -316.5 \, \text{kJ}.
\]
