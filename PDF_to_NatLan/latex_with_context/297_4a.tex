A diagram is drawn representing the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled phase regions and states:  
- State 1: MD (moisture-laden air) inlet.  
- State 3: Compressor outlet.  
- State 4: Condenser outlet.  
- Sublimation line is marked.  
- The diagram shows transitions between states with arrows, indicating the process flow.
