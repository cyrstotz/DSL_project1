The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int_{S_{\text{in}}}^{S_{\text{out}}} T \, ds}{S_{\text{out}} - S_{\text{in}}} = \frac{\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \frac{T}{T} \, ds}{\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \frac{c_p}{T} \, dt}
\]  

This equation represents the mean temperature based on entropy integration.
