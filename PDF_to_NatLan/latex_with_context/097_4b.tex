The mass flow rate of the refrigerant \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is calculated using the energy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  
Rearranging for \( \dot{m} \):  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]  
Here, \( h_2 \) corresponds to the enthalpy at state 2, and \( h_3 \) corresponds to the enthalpy at state 3.  

Additional notes suggest:  
- \( h_2 \) is evaluated at \( x_2 = 1 \) and \( T_2 \).  
- \( h_3 \) is evaluated at \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \) and \( T_3 \).
