The solution uses \( \Delta m_{12} = 3600 \, \text{kg} \) based on a proposed solution.  

The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 \cdot s_2 - m_1 \cdot s_1
\]  
Where:  
\[
m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg}, \quad m_2 = 9355 \, \text{kg}
\]  
\[
s_1 = 0.2966 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}, \quad s_2 = 0.5940 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = 7226.16 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]  

This value is underlined in the solution.
