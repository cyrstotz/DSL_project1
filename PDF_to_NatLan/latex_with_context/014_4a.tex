Two pressure-temperature (\(p-T\)) diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram shows phase regions with pressure (\(p\)) on the vertical axis and temperature (\(T\)) on the horizontal axis. The curve represents phase transitions, including solid, liquid, and gas regions. The transitions between phases are labeled.  

2. The second diagram zooms into the sublimation point. It shows the solid, liquid, and gas regions, with the sublimation curve labeled. Points 1 and 2 are marked, indicating the process path during sublimation.
