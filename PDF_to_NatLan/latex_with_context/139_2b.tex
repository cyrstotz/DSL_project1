Energy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a - \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} + g(z_e - z_a) \right) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  
Assumptions:  
- \( g(z_e - z_a) = 0 \), as the change in elevation is negligible.  
- \( \dot{W} = 0 \), as the volume work is not considered.  

The heat transfer per unit mass flow rate is given as:  
\[
q_B = \frac{\dot{Q}_B}{\dot{m}_K}
\]  
From the problem setup:  
\[
q_B = \dot{Q}_B = 1195 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The mass flow rate ratio between the bypass and core streams is:  
\[
\frac{\dot{m}_M}{\dot{m}_K} = 5.293
\]  
Thus, the total mass flow rate is:  
\[
\dot{m}_{\text{total}} = \dot{m}_K + \dot{m}_M = \dot{m}_K \left( 1 + 5.293 \right) = 6.293 \dot{m}_K
\]

The equation of state for an ideal gas is given as \( p v = R T \), which implies that \( \frac{p}{R} = \text{const} = \frac{T}{v} \).  

The temperature \( T_6 \) is equal to \( T_5 \), as the process is adiabatic.  

The ratio of temperatures is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_1} = \frac{T_5}{T_1}
\]
