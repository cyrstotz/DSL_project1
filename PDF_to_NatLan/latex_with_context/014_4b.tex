The energy balance around the compressor is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (u_2 - u_3) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}_K
\]  
The work done by the compressor (\(W_K\)) is expressed as:  
\[
W_K = \dot{m} \cdot (u_2 - u_3)
\]  

The internal energy at state 2 (\(u_2\)) is calculated using the refrigerant properties:  
\[
u_2 = u_g(40^\circ\text{C}) = 226.27 \, \text{kJ/kg} \quad \text{(from Table A-10)}
\]  

The temperature range is given as \(T_i = 0^\circ\text{C} + 10^\circ\text{C} = 10^\circ\text{C}\).  

For state 3, assuming isentropic compression:  
\[
s_2 = s_3
\]  
From Table A-12, interpolating for \(s_g(40^\circ\text{C}) = 0.9169 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}\) at 8 bar:  
\[
x_3 = \frac{s_3 - s_f}{s_g - s_f} = 0.334 \quad \text{(from Table A-12)}
\]  

The internal energy at state 3 (\(u_3\)) is calculated using:  
\[
u_3 = u_f(40^\circ\text{C}) + x \cdot (u_g(40^\circ\text{C}) - u_f(40^\circ\text{C}))
\]  

The mass flow rate (\(\dot{m}\)) is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{V}_K}{u_2 - u_3}
\]
