The ice mass fraction (\( x_{\text{ice},2} \)) is determined using thermodynamic equilibrium with the gas.  

The equation for the change in specific internal energy (\( u_2 - u_1 \)) is:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta u_2 = -200.091 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The specific internal energy at state 2 (\( u_2 \)) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = x \cdot u_{\text{ice},0^\circ} + (1 - x) \cdot u_{\text{water},0^\circ} = -200.093 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Substituting the values:  
\[
u_2 = x \cdot u_{\text{ice},0.032} + (1 - x) \cdot u_{\text{water},0.032}
\]  

The final ice mass fraction is:  
\[
x = 0.600
\]
