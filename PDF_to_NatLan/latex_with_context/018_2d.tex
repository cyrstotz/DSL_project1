The task involves calculating the exergy destruction (\( ex_{\text{dest}} \)) in the engine.

The exergy destruction is expressed as:  
\[
ex_{\text{val}} = T_0 \dot{S}_{\text{ex}}
\]  

The entropy production rate is given as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{ex}} = \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} (s_6 - s_0) = \frac{\dot{Q}}{T}
\]  

This equation accounts for the heat transfer and entropy generation in the system.
