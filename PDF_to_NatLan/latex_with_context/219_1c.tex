The second law of thermodynamics for the reactor is expressed as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} (s_e - s_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{aus}}}{T_{\text{KF}}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_R}{T_{\text{Reactor,1}}} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
The entropy production term \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is included in the equation.
