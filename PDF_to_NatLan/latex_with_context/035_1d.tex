The energy balance equation for the system is written as:  
\[
\Delta m \left[ h \right] + Q - W + \sum \dot{m} \left( h \right) = \Delta U + \frac{1}{2} \Delta KE + \Delta PE
\]  
Here, kinetic energy (\( \Delta KE \)) and potential energy (\( \Delta PE \)) are considered negligible, simplifying the equation.
