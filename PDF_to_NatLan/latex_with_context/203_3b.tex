Since the mass above the membrane remains constant, the pressure below must also remain constant:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{g,2} = 1.401 \, \text{bar}
\]

The first law of thermodynamics applied to the cylinder is:  
\[
\Delta E = Q - W = \Delta U
\]

The work done is expressed as:  
\[
W_{12} = \int p \, dv = p_1 (V_2 - V_1)
\]

The change in internal energy is:  
\[
U_1 - U_2 = c_V (T_1 - T_2)
\]
