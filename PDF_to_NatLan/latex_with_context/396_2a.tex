The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The vertical axis is labeled as temperature \( T \) in Kelvin, and the horizontal axis is labeled as entropy \( s \) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \). The diagram includes two isobaric lines: one at \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and another at \( 0.1916 \, \text{bar} \). The process starts at point \( 0 \), moves vertically upward along an isentropic path, and transitions to point \( 5 \) along an isobaric line.
