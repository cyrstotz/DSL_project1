The energy balance equation is repeated with some crossed-out text:  
\[
\dot{m} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W} = 0
\]  
This equation is used to calculate the heat transfer or work done in the system.

Descriptions of diagrams:  
- The diagrams illustrate thermodynamic processes in \(p\)-\(V\) and \(T\)-\(S\) spaces, with labeled points and arrows indicating the direction of the processes.  
- The diagrams are consistent with the freeze-drying process described in Task 4.

The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated as:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{Q_K}{Q_{\text{ab}} - Q_Z} = \frac{Q_K}{W_K} = \frac{Q_K}{Q_{\text{ab}} - Q_Z} = \frac{Q_K}{28 \, \text{W}}
\]  
The heat transfer \( Q_K \) is given by:  
\[
Q_K = \dot{m} \cdot (-h_1 + h_2)
\]  
Further calculations or explanations are incomplete.
