A graph is drawn showing the freeze-drying process on a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents pressure (\( p \)) in bar.  
- The horizontal axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in degrees Celsius.  

The graph includes the following features:  
- A curve labeled "Triple" indicating the triple point of water.  
- Several processes are marked:  
  - State 1 is labeled as "isobar."  
  - State 2 is labeled as "isobar."  
  - A transition between states 1 and 2 is shown.  
  - State 5 is marked near the triple point.
