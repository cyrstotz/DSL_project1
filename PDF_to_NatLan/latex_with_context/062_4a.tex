A graph is drawn with pressure (\( p \)) on the vertical axis and specific volume (\( v \)) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a curve resembling a phase diagram, with a peak indicating the critical point. The curve divides the regions of liquid, vapor, and mixed-phase states. The critical point is labeled as "Crit." The axes are marked as follows:  
- \( p \) (pressure) on the vertical axis.  
- \( v \, \left[\frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{kg}}\right] \) (specific volume) on the horizontal axis.
