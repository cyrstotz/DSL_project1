The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot \left(h_e - h_a\right) + \dot{Q}_K
\]  
The heat transfer rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = \dot{m} \cdot \left(h_a - h_e\right)
\]  
Specific enthalpy relationships are given:  
\[
h_a = h_2, \quad h_e = h_1, \quad h_g = h_4
\]  
The vapor quality (\(x_0\)) is defined at \(T = -6^\circ\text{C}\), and the pressure is calculated as:  
\[
p_1 = 3.376 \, \text{bar}
\]  
It is noted that \(p_2 = p_1\).
