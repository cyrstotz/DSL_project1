The exergy balance for the turbine is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \Delta ex_{1 \to 6} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_6} \right) \dot{Q}_0 - ex_{\text{vert}}
\]  
Expanding the exergy destruction term:  
\[
ex_{\text{vert}} = \Delta ex_{1 \to 6} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_6} \right) \dot{Q}_0
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
ex_{\text{vert}} = 100 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + \left( 1 - \frac{243.15}{1289} \right) \cdot 1195 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
ex_{\text{vert}} = 1089.38 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Additional notes are written indicating that the calculation proceeds using the given values, as the result is unclear.  

No work is performed, and the term \( -ex_{\text{vert}} \) is crossed out.
