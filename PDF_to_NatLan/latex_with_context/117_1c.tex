Entropy balance between the coolant and the reactor:  

The entropy rate equation is given as:  
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{Reactor}}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  

It is noted that both terms are not closed systems.  

Rearranging the equation:  
\[
0 = \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  

Solving for entropy generation:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = -\frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}} = \frac{-37.838 \, \text{kW}}{295 \, \text{K}} = 0.7283 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]
