The diagram is a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) graph with labeled points corresponding to states in a thermodynamic process. The vertical axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin, and the horizontal axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \). The graph shows a sequence of states labeled \( 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \), connected by lines indicating transitions between these states.
