The throttling process is adiabatic and isenthalpic, meaning \( h_4 = h_3 \).  
For the isobaric process at \( p_4 = p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \):  
\[
h_4 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
For the isobaric process at \( p_1 = p_2 = 3.3765 \, \text{bar} \):  
\[
h_1 = 3.3765 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Using interpolation at \( T_2 = 46^\circ \text{C} \):  
\[
x = \frac{h_4 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} = 0.156
\]
