The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the equation:  
\[
m \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}.
\]  

The change in specific internal energy \( u_2 - u_1 \) is expressed as:  
\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_V \cdot p_{g} \cdot (T_2 - T_1).
\]  

Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = 0.00314 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \text{kJ/(kgÂ·K)} \cdot (773.15 \, \text{K} - 273.153 \, \text{K}).
\]  

\[
Q_{12} = 1076 \, \text{J}.
\]
