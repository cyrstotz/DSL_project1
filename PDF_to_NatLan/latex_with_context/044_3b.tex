The temperature \( T_{\text{EW},2} \) is stated to be \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) because \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), meaning there is still ice present. No heat exchange occurs anymore, and the system is in thermal equilibrium.  

The pressure in state 2 is calculated as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_1 = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]
