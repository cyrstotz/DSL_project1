The page contains a labeled diagram and accompanying notes related to a thermodynamic process.  

### Diagram Description:  
The diagram is a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) plot with labeled states (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The vertical axis represents temperature in Kelvin (\( T [K] \)), and the horizontal axis represents entropy in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \). Several isobars (\( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \)) are drawn as dashed lines across the plot.  

- State 0 is at the lowest temperature and entropy.  
- The process moves from state 0 to state 1, labeled as \( \eta < 1 \).  
- From state 1 to state 2, the process is labeled "isentrop."  
- From state 2 to state 3, the process is labeled "isobar."  
- From state 3 to state 4, the process is labeled "Adiab non-rev" (adiabatic non-reversible).  
- From state 4 to state 5, the process is labeled "isobar."  
- From state 5 to state 6, the process is labeled "isentrop."  

The diagram also includes a reference temperature \( T_{HS} \) marked with a dashed line near state 0.  

### Notes:  
- \( p_5 = p_1 = p_4 \)  
- Process descriptions:  
  - \( 0 \to 1 \): \( \eta < 1 \)  
  - \( 1 \to 2 \): Isentropic  
  - \( 2 \to 3 \): Isobaric  
  - \( 3 \to 4 \): Adiabatic, non-reversible  
  - \( 4 \to 5 \): Isobaric  
  - \( 5 \to 6 \): Isentropic
