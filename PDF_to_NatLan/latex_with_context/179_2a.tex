The diagram is a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) plot representing the jet engine thermodynamic process. It includes labeled states (1 through 6) and key process paths:  
- **Isobaric processes** are marked between states 2 and 3, and states 5 and 6.  
- **Isentropic processes** are marked between states 1 and 2, and states 4 and 5.  
- The combustion process is labeled between states 3 and 4.  
The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( S \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis.
