The problem involves cooling the reactor contents from state 1 (\( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \)) to state 2 (\( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \)). A mass \( \Delta m_{12} \) of saturated liquid water at \( T_{\text{in,12}} = 20^\circ\text{C} \) is added. The heat released during cooling is \( Q_{\text{out},12} = 35 \, \text{MJ} \).  

A diagram is provided, showing the heat flow \( Q_{\text{out},12} \) and the transition between states 1 and 2.  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta S = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_{\text{in}} + Q_{\text{out},12} - \sum W_{\text{ext}} = 0
\]

It is noted that \( m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12} \).
