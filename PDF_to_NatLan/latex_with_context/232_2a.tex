The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \).  
- The vertical axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin (\( \text{K} \)).  

The process is divided into several states:  
1. State 1 to 2: Adiabatic compression (isentropic).  
2. State 2 to 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
3. State 3 to 4: Adiabatic expansion (isentropic).  
4. State 4 to 5: Mixing process.  
5. State 5 to 6: Expansion through the nozzle.  

The diagram includes labeled isobars and arrows indicating the transitions between states.
