The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) plot labeled with the axes: \( p \) in bar and \( T \) in Kelvin.  

- The curve labeled "Isotherme" represents an isothermal process.  
- Two distinct paths are marked:  
  - Path \( i \): This is described as "sharp" with \( \Delta T < 0 \), indicating a decrease in temperature.  
  - Path \( ii \): This is described as "isothermal," indicating constant temperature.  

Points labeled "1," "2," and "6" are shown along the curve, representing states in the process.  

Description of the graph:  
The graph depicts a process involving changes in pressure and temperature. The isothermal curve suggests that the process transitions between states while maintaining constant temperature in certain regions. Path \( i \) shows a temperature drop, while path \( ii \) maintains isothermal conditions.
