The problem assumes no friction and an isentropic compression or expansion process. The relationship between temperatures and pressures is given by:  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
where \( \kappa = \frac{c_p}{c_v} \). Substituting \( c_p \) and \( c_v \) into \( \kappa \), the expression becomes:  
\[
\kappa = \frac{\frac{R}{M} + c_v}{c_v}
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
\kappa = R/c_v + 1
\]  

It is noted that the pressure does not change:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]
