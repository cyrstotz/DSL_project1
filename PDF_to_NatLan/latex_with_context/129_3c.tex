The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the specific heat capacity:  
\[
Q_{12} = c_p m_g (T_{2} - T_{1})
\]  
where \( c_p = \frac{R}{M_g} + c_V \).  

Substituting values:  
\[
c_p = \frac{8.314}{50} + 0.633 = 0.799 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  
\[
Q_{12} = 0.799 \cdot 3.42 \cdot (500 - 0)
\]  
\[
Q_{12} = 1366.8 \, \text{J}
\]
