A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and states:  
- State 1: Adiabatic compression.  
- State 2: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 3: Irreversible adiabatic expansion.  
- State 5: Mixing chamber.  
- State 6: Nozzle exit.  

The isobars are labeled as follows:  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \)  
- \( p_1 = p_4 = p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( p_0 = p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  

The axes are labeled:  
- \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin) on the vertical axis.  
- \( s \) (entropy in \( \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \)) on the horizontal axis.  

Dashed lines indicate transitions between states, and the process flow is clearly marked.
