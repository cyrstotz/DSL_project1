The pressure of the gas has not changed because no new components have been added to exert additional pressure. Therefore:  
\[
p_{2,g} = p_{1,g} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

If, in state 2, no heat is transferred between the gas and the ice-water mixture (EW), there can be no temperature difference between the gas and the EW. This implies:  
\[
T_{2,g} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]
