The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is calculated for a closed system undergoing a stationary flow process.  

\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (S_e - S_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]

Rearranging:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \dot{m} \cdot (S_a - S_e) - \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T}
\]

The entropy production is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = 212.77 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{s}}
\]

Additional note: Entropy production occurs due to reactions and heat transfer, not only within the cooling jacket.
