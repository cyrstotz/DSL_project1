The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process in a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars corresponding to different pressure states:  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \)  
- \( p_1 = p_4 = p_5 \)  
- \( p_0 = p_6 \)  

The diagram shows six states connected by arrows indicating the thermodynamic transitions:  
1. State 0 to State 1: Compression.  
2. State 1 to State 2: Further compression.  
3. State 2 to State 3: Combustion.  
4. State 3 to State 4: Expansion in the turbine.  
5. State 4 to State 5: Mixing.  
6. State 5 to State 6: Expansion in the nozzle.  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature) in Kelvin on the vertical axis.  
- \( s \) (entropy) in \( \text{W}/\text{kgÂ·K} \) on the horizontal axis.
