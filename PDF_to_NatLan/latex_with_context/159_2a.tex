The diagram represents a temperature (\(T\)) versus entropy (\(S\)) plot for the jet engine process. It includes labeled states (1 through 6) and isobars (\(p_0\), \(p_5\), \(p_4\), \(p_3\), \(p_2\)). The process transitions between states as follows:  
- State 1 to 2: Compression  
- State 2 to 3: Isobaric heat addition  
- State 3 to 4: Expansion  
- State 4 to 5: Mixing  
- State 5 to 6: Nozzle expansion  

Dashed lines indicate constant pressure levels, and arrows show the direction of the process.
