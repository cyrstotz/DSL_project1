The thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) of the coolant is calculated as:  
\[
T_{\text{KF}} = \frac{\int T \, dQ}{\dot{Q}}
\]  

The entropy difference \( s_2 - s_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
s_2 - s_1 = s_g - s_f = 7.72 - 6.384 = 1.336 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K}
\]  

The entropy integral is expressed as:  
\[
s_2 - s_1 = \int \frac{c_p}{T} \, dT = c_p \cdot \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)
\]
