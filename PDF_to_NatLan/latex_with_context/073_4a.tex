The graph depicts a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The vertical axis represents pressure (\( p \) in bar), and the horizontal axis represents temperature (\( T \) in Kelvin). The curve shows a typical phase boundary, starting with a steep increase, reaching a peak, and then gradually decreasing. This represents the transition between different phases of the refrigerant.
