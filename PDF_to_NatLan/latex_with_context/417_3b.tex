The gas pressure \( p_{g,2} \) and temperature \( T_{g,2} \) are determined as follows:  

\[
p_{g,2} = \frac{m_K \cdot g}{A}
\]

Here, \( p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \), as the mass of the piston remains constant and the density of the ice-water mixture does not change.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is given as \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) or \( 273.15 \, \text{K} \), because the system is still in equilibrium with ice present in the water. The water does not warm further since the ice has not completely melted.
