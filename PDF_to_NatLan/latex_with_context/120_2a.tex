The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in degrees Celsius (\( ^\circ C \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \).  

Key features of the diagram:  
- The process begins at state \( 0 \), marked as "isentrop."  
- State \( 1 \) is connected to state \( 2 \) via an isentropic compression process.  
- State \( 2 \) transitions to state \( 3 \) along an isobaric line.  
- State \( 3 \) transitions to state \( 4 \), also along an isobaric line.  
- State \( 4 \) transitions to state \( 5 \) through an isentropic expansion process.  
- State \( 5 \) transitions to state \( 6 \) along an isobaric line, with \( p_0 \) labeled.
