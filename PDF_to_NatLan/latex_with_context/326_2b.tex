The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
h_0 - h_6 + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} = 0
\]  
Rearranging for \(w_6\):  
\[
w_6^2 = 2(h_0 - h_6) + w_0^2
\]  
Taking the square root:  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2(h_0 - h_6) + w_0^2}
\]  
Substituting \(h_0 - h_6 = c_p(T_0 - T_6)\):  
\[
w_6 = \sqrt{2 c_p (T_0 - T_6) + w_0^2}
\]  

The specific heat capacity is again noted as:  
\[
c_p = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]

The thermodynamic mean temperature \( \bar{T}_6 \) is calculated as:
\[
\bar{T}_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{0.181}{0.5} \right) \left( \frac{0.9}{1.4} \right) = 328 \, \text{K}
\]

The outlet velocity \( w_C \) is determined using the following equation:
\[
w_C = \sqrt{2 c_p \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \left( T_6 - \bar{T}_6 \right) + w_5^2}
\]
