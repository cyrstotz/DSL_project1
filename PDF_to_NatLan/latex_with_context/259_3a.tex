The mass of the gas is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
m = \frac{p \cdot V}{R \cdot T}
\]  
The gas constant \( R \) is derived as:  
\[
R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M}
\]  
where \( \bar{R} = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \) and \( M = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol} \). Substituting values:  
\[
R = \frac{8.314}{50} = 0.166 \, \text{J/(kg·K)}
\]  
The pressure is expressed as:  
\[
p = \frac{R \cdot T}{V}
\]
