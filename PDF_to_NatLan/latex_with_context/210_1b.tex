The entropy production equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i s_i + \sum \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]  
The term \( \frac{dS}{dt} \) is crossed out, indicating steady-state operation (\( \text{stFP} \)). The equation simplifies to:  
\[
\sum \dot{m}_i s_i + \sum \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \dot{S}_{\text{gen}}
\]
