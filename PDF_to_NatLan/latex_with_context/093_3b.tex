The pressure in state 2 is equal to the pressure in state 1:  
\[
p_2 = p_1
\]  

There is no pressure change because the pressure depends only on the weight and piston area.  

The temperature in state 2 is interpolated from the temperature values in the table:  
\[
T(1.4 \, \text{bar}) = T(1.4 \, \text{bar}) - \frac{T(2 \, \text{bar}) - T(1 \, \text{bar})}{2 - 1} \cdot (1.4 - 1)
\]  

This results in:  
\[
T_2 = -0.012^\circ \text{C}
\]  

The temperature must remain constant because the ice is still present in the system.
