The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p-T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It shows the phase regions labeled as "Fl√ºssiggebiet" (liquid region), "Dampfgebiet" (vapor region), and "Mischgebiet" (mixed region). The curve includes a critical point labeled "kritischer Punkt." The process steps are marked with states 1, 2, 3, and 4, connected by yellow lines to represent transitions.  

- State 1 is in the mixed region.  
- State 2 is in the vapor region.  
- State 3 is in the vapor region, near the critical point.  
- State 4 is in the liquid region.
