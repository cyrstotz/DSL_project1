The heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated.  

First, the change in energy \( \Delta E \) is computed using:  
\[
\Delta E = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
\Delta E = 3.422 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 0.633 \cdot 10^3 \cdot (500 - 0) = 1.083 \, \text{kJ}
\]  

Thus, the heat transferred \( Q_{12} \) is \( 1.083 \, \text{kJ} \).
