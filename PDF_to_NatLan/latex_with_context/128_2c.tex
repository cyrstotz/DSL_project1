The following equations and notes are written:  
- \( p_0 = p_c \)  
- A steady-state energy balance at the nozzle is described:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_5 - h_6) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]
- The work term is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{W} = \dot{m} \cdot (h_5 - h_6)
\]
- The enthalpy \( h_5 \) at \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( 431.9 \, \text{K} \) is interpolated using Table A-22 for \( x_1 = 430 \, \text{K} \) and \( x_2 = 440 \, \text{K} \).
