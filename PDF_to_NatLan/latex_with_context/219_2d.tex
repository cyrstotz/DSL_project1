The entropy production is calculated using the formula:  
\[
0 = s_e - s_a + \frac{q}{T} + s_{0z}
\]  
For an adiabatic process (\( q = 0 \)):  
\[
s_{0z} = \Delta s_{06} = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right)
\]  
Substituting numerical values:  
\[
s_{0z} = 0.3014 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  
The velocity-related exergy is:  
\[
e_{v,\text{vel}} = T_0 s_{0z}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
e_{v,\text{vel}} = 73.276 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

Description of the diagram:  
A graph is drawn with temperature \( T \) on the vertical axis and entropy \( s \) on the horizontal axis. The curve represents the thermodynamic process, with labeled points 0, 2, and 6. Point 2 is shown as an intermediate state between points 0 and 6.
