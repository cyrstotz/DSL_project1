The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 S_2 - m_1 S_1
\]  

Here, \( S_1 \) is referenced from exercise c and also depends on \( S_2 \).  

The given values are:  
\[
m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg}, \quad m_2 = \Delta m + m_1 = 9355 \, \text{kg}
\]  

Substituting into the equation:  
\[
\Delta S = 9355 \cdot 1.3069 - 0.1956 \cdot 5755 = 6733.97
\]
