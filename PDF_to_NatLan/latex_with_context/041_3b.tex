The system reaches thermodynamic equilibrium in state 2. The temperature of the gas and the ice-water mixture are equal:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  

Since the temperature remains constant in the solid-liquid equilibrium region:  
\[
T_{\text{EW},2} = T_{\text{EW},1}
\]  
Thus:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},1} = 0^\circ\text{C}
\]  

The pressure in state 2 remains equal to the pressure in state 1:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 0.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  

Because no mass is lost and the area remains constant, the same mass continues to exert pressure on the same surface area.
