The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}
\]  
For work:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta Q - \Delta W
\]  

The detailed energy balance is expressed as:  
\[
m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 + \Delta KE + \Delta PE = \Delta Q
\]  
Where \( u_2 \) and \( u_1 \) are the specific internal energies at states 2 and 1, respectively.  

Given:  
\[
u_1 \, (500^\circ\text{C}, 1.4 \, \text{bar}), \quad u_2 \, (0.003^\circ\text{C})
\]
