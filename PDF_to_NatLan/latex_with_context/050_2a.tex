The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) (temperature-entropy) diagram for the jet engine process. It includes labeled isobars and key states (0 to 6). The following features are visible:  
- State 0: Ambient conditions at \( -30^\circ\text{C} \).  
- State 1: Compression begins, \( p_2 = p_3 \).  
- State 3: Combustion occurs, \( p_4 < p_3 \).  
- State 4: Expansion in the turbine, \( p_5 = p_6 \).  
- State 5: Mixing chamber, \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  
- State 6: Nozzle exit, \( p_6 = p_0 \).  

The diagram shows reversible adiabatic processes (marked "ad.rev"), isobaric combustion, and the nozzle exit conditions. The entropy increases during irreversible processes.
