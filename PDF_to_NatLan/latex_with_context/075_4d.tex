The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  
An alternative form is shown:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{Q_{\text{ob}} - Q_{\text{in}}}
\]  

Additional notes:  
- A table is partially filled with columns labeled \( T \), \( p \), \( h \), and \( S \) for states 1 through 4.  
- Some entries are left blank, while pressures for states 3 and 4 are noted as "8 bar."
