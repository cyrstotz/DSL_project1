A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) (in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a curve labeled "Triple point" at its peak, with phase regions labeled as "Liquid," "Vapor," and "Solid." The curve represents the phase boundaries between these regions.
