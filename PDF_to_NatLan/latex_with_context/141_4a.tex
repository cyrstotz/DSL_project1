A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn, showing the freeze-drying process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and phase regions.  
- Point 3 is marked at 8 bar, representing the high-pressure state after compression.  
- Point 2 is located on the curve, representing the isobaric evaporation process.  
- The diagram includes annotations for "isotrope" and "isobar" to indicate the thermodynamic paths.  
- The x-axis is labeled as temperature (\( T \)), and the y-axis is labeled as pressure (\( p \)).
