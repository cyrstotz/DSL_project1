The table lists various states of the jet engine process with corresponding values for pressure (\( p \)), temperature (\( T \)), and entropy (\( s \)).  

- State 0:  
  \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = -30^\circ\text{C} \), \( s \) is not provided.  

- State 1:  
  \( p \) and \( T \) are the same as state 0, \( s \) is not provided.  

- State 2:  
  \( p \) and \( T \) are the same as state 1, \( s \) is not provided.  

- State 3:  
  \( p \) and \( T \) are not provided, \( s \) is not provided.  

- State 4:  
  \( p \) and \( T \) are not provided, \( s \) is not provided.  

- State 5:  
  \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = 431.9 \, \text{K} \), \( s \) is not provided.  

- State 6:  
  \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( T = 2340 \, \text{K} \), \( s \) is not provided.  

Additional notes:  
- At state 0, the airspeed is \( w_{\text{air}} = 200 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- At state 5, the outlet velocity is \( w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s} \).

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_6 - h_5 + \frac{w_6^2 - w_5^2}{2} \right) + \dot{W}
\]  

The work per unit mass flow rate is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\dot{W} = R \frac{T_6 - T_5}{1 - \kappa} = 74.077 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The specific gas constant \( R \) is determined as:  
\[
R = \frac{8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}}{28.97 \, \text{kg/kmol}} = 0.28868 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  

Additional terms are written, possibly related to velocity or pressure:  
\[
\frac{w_6^2}{2}, \quad \frac{p_5}{2}
\]  

A note is included stating:  
"nach \( w_6 \) umstellen,"  
which translates to "rearrange for \( w_6 \)."
