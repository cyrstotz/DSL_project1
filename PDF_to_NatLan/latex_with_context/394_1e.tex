The entropy change is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 S_2 - m_1 S_1
\]  
The total mass in state 1 is:  
\[
m_1 = m_{\text{total},1} = 5755 \, \text{kg}
\]  
The total mass in state 2 is:  
\[
m_2 = \Delta m_{12} + m_{\text{total},1} = 5855 \, \text{kg}
\]  
The entropy in state 1 is calculated using the steam quality \( x_D \):  
\[
S_1 = S_f(100^\circ\text{C}) + x_D \cdot (S_g(100^\circ\text{C}) - S_f(100^\circ\text{C}))
\]  
From the water tables (Table A2):  
\[
S_f(100^\circ\text{C}) = 1.3069 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}, \quad S_g(100^\circ\text{C}) = 7.354 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
The entropy in state 2 is:  
\[
S_2 = S_g(70^\circ\text{C}) = 7.7553 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}}
\]  
The entropy change is then calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = 64.85 \, \text{MJ/K}
\]
