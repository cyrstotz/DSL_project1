The energy change is expressed as:  
\[
\Delta E = \dot{Q} \implies m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \dot{Q}
\]  
The internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = u_f + X (u_{g} - u_f)
\]  
Substituting into the equation:  
\[
m_2 (u_f + X (u_{g} - u_f)) = m_1 u_1 + \dot{Q}
\]  
Rearranging for \( X \):  
\[
X = \frac{m_1}{m_2} \cdot \frac{1}{(u_{g} - u_f)} \left( m_1 u_1 + \dot{Q} - u_f \right)
\]  

The equation for \( u_g \) is left incomplete.
