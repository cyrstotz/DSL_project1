The process described is a throttling (or expansion) process that is isenthalpic. The enthalpy at state 1 (\( h_1 \)) equals the enthalpy at state 2 (\( h_2 \)), which is equal to the enthalpy of the saturated liquid (\( h_f \)):  
\[
h_1 = h_2 = h_f = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The vapor quality (\( x_1 \)) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]

Substituting the values, the vapor quality is determined to be:  
\[
x_1 = 0
\]
