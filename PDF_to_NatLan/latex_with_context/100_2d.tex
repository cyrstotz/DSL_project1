The exergy destruction \( ex_{\text{dest}} \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
ex_{\text{dest}} = T_0 \cdot S_{\text{gen}}
\]  

The entropy generation \( S_{\text{gen}} \) is derived as:  
\[
S_{\text{gen}} = \dot{m} \cdot (s_2 - s_1) - \frac{Q}{T_J}
\]  

Further derivation includes:  
\[
S_{\text{gen}} = \dot{m} \cdot (s_6 - s_0) - \frac{q}{T_J}
\]  

Another expression for \( S_{\text{gen}} \):  
\[
S_{\text{gen}} = \dot{m} \cdot c_p(T_2 - T_1) - \dots
\]  

Some calculations are crossed out, but the final exergy destruction is noted as:  
\[
\Delta ex = 80.3 \, \text{kW}
\]  

The mass flow rate \( m_6 \) is calculated as:  
\[
m_6 = \dot{m}_K \cdot (1 + 5.293 \cdot m_c)
\]
