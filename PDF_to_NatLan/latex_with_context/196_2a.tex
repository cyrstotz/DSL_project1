A T-s diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled states (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and processes:  
- Between states 0 and 1: Isobaric process.  
- Between states 1 and 2: Adiabatic, reversible, and isentropic compression.  
- Between states 2 and 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
- Between states 3 and 4: Adiabatic, irreversible expansion (entropy increases).  
- Between states 4 and 5: Isobaric mixing.  
- Between states 5 and 6: Isentropic expansion in the nozzle.  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The x-axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kg·K} \).  
- The y-axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (K).

The ambient temperature is given as \( T_0 = 283.15 \, \text{K} \).  

The exergy destruction is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = \left( 85.925 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - 283.15 \, \text{K} \cdot \left( 0.303 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \right) \right) + \frac{\left( 507.294 \, \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2} \right)^2}{2} - \frac{\left( 700 \, \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2} \right)^2}{2}
\]

Breaking down the calculation:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = 85.925 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - 73.2772 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + 123.685 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - 257.2926 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - 70 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

Final result:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = -120.005 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
