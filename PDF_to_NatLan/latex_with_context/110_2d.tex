The exergy flow rate is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{e}_{\text{exergy}} = T_0 \cdot \dot{S}_{\text{exergy}}
\]  

The specific exergy flow is expressed as:  
\[
e_{\text{exergy}} = T_0 \cdot s_{\text{exergy}}
\]  

The heat addition term is given as:  
\[
q_B = \frac{\dot{Q}_B}{\dot{m}_K}
\]  

The bypass-to-core mass ratio is:  
\[
\frac{\dot{m}_M}{\dot{m}_K} = 5.293
\]  

The entropy balance is expanded:  
\[
O = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \cdot (s_e - s_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T_j} \cdot s_{\text{exergy}} + \frac{q_B}{T_B}
\]  

The entropy production term is expressed as:  
\[
O = s_e - s_a + \frac{q_B}{T_j} \cdot s_{\text{exergy}}
\]  

The specific heat capacity term is calculated:  
\[
c_p \cdot \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_3} \right) - R \cdot \ln \left( \frac{p_2}{p_3} \right) + 5.293 \cdot s_{\text{exergy}} + \frac{q_B}{T_B}
\]  

The temperatures \( T_2 \) and \( T_3 \) are queried for further calculations.
