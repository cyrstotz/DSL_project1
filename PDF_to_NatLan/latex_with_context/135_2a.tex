A qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram is drawn to represent the jet engine process. The diagram includes labeled isobars and key states:  
- State 0 is at ambient pressure \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  
- State 2 is labeled with \( p = 13 \, \text{bar} \).  
- States 3, 4, and 5 are connected with curved lines representing the compression and combustion processes.  
- State 5 is labeled with \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- State 6 is labeled with \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  

The diagram shows the thermodynamic process qualitatively, with transitions between states and isobaric lines clearly marked.
