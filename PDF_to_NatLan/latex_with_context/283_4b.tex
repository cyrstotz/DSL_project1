The graph again represents a pressure-temperature (\(P\)-\(T\)) diagram. The pressure axis is labeled in bar (\([ \text{bar} ]\)), and the temperature axis is labeled in Kelvin (\([ \text{K} ]\)). The diagram includes additional annotations:  
- A horizontal line labeled "isobaric condensation" connects points 1 and 2.  
- A vertical line labeled "isothermal pressure reduction" connects points 2 and 3.  
- Two dashed horizontal lines are drawn at pressures of 10 mbar and 5 mbar, indicating specific pressure levels relevant to the sublimation process.  

The curve represents the phase boundary, and the critical point is marked similarly to the previous graph.

Energy balance for the compressor:  

\[
\dot{W}_h = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_3)
\]
