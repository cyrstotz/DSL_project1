Two diagrams are drawn, both labeled with axes \( p \, [\text{mbar}] \) and \( T \, [\text{K}] \).  

1. The first diagram illustrates the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. It shows four states connected by arrows:  
   - State 1 to State 2 is labeled "isobar."  
   - State 2 to State 3 is labeled "adiabat."  
   - State 3 to State 4 is labeled "isobar."  
   - State 4 to State 1 is labeled "adiabat."  

2. The second diagram also represents the process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram, with similar states and transitions:  
   - State 1 to State 2 is labeled "isobar."  
   - State 2 to State 3 is labeled "adiabat."  
   - State 3 to State 4 is labeled "isobar."  
   - State 4 to State 1 is labeled "adiabat."
