The specific exergy destruction is given as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = -100 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

From the summary, it is known that for stationary flow processes, the following applies:  
\[
0 = -\Delta ex_{\text{str}} + \dot{ex}_Q - \dot{N}_{\text{in}} - ex_{\text{verl}}
\]  

The exergy loss is calculated as:  
\[
ex_{\text{verl}} = -\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = -100 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
