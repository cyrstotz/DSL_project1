The transferred heat \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture is calculated using the energy balance:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot u_2 - m_g \cdot u_1 = m_{\text{EW}} \cdot c_V \cdot (T_{2,\text{EW}} - T_{1,\text{EW}})
\]  
Where \( T_{2,\text{EW}} \) and \( T_{1,\text{EW}} \) are the final and initial temperatures of the ice-water mixture, respectively.
