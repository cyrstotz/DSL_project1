The pressure remains constant because the external pressure and the mass of the ice-water mixture remain unchanged:  
\[
p_2 = 1.40094 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The mass of the gas, pressure, and gas constant remain unchanged, but the volume changes. Therefore, the temperature also changes.  

Since \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \), the temperature of the ice-water mixture remains at \( T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ\text{C} \), and the gas temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is also \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).
