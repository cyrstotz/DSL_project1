The diagram is a qualitative T-s diagram representing the jet engine process. It includes labeled isobars and process states:  
- State 0 is the ambient condition.  
- State 1 is the inlet air compression.  
- State 2 is the high-pressure compressed air.  
- State 3 is the combustion process.  
- State 4 is the turbine expansion.  
- State 5 is the mixing chamber.  
- State 6 is the nozzle exit.  

The axes are labeled:  
- The vertical axis represents temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (\( \text{K} \)).  
- The horizontal axis represents entropy \( s \) in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).
