The vapor quality (\(x_1\)) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]  

For \(h_3\):  
\[
s_3 = s_2 = 0.9169 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}
\]  
This indicates the state is superheated (\( \text{überhitzt} \)).  

Interpolation is performed to find \(h_3\):  
\[
h_3 = 264.15 \, \text{kJ/kg} + \frac{1}{\dots} \cdot \frac{273.66 - 264.15}{0.9374 - 0.93066} \cdot (0.9169 - 0.93066)
\]
