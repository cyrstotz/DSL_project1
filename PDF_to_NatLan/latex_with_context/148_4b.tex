The heat transfer rate is calculated using the equation:  
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) = 28 \, \text{W}
\]  
From Table A-14:  
\[
h_2 = h_f(8 \, \text{bar}) = 263.95 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The section labeled "Drossel isenthalp" is crossed out and ignored.  

The enthalpy at state 1 is given as:  
\[
h_1 = h_2
\]
