The diagram represents a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) (temperature-entropy) process diagram for a jet engine. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is \( T \) (temperature) with units \( \frac{u}{\text{kg} \cdot u} \).  
- The horizontal axis is \( s \) (entropy) with units \( \frac{u}{\text{kg} \cdot u} \).  

Key features of the diagram:  
- The process begins at state 1 and follows a vertical line labeled \( s = \text{const} \) (isentropic process).  
- State 2 transitions to state 3 along an isobaric curve labeled "Isobare 2,3".  
- State 3 transitions to state 4 along another isobaric curve labeled "Isobare 4,5".  
- State 4 transitions to state 5 along a vertical line labeled \( s = \text{const} \).
