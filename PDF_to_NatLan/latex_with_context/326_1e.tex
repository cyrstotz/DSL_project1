The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents is calculated using the entropy balance equation:  
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \dot{m} \cdot (s_2 - s_1) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{KF}}}
\]  
Where \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) represents the entropy generation, \( s_2 \) and \( s_1 \) are the specific entropies at states 2 and 1, respectively, and \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is the thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant.
