A graph is drawn representing a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is \( T \) (temperature) in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- The horizontal axis is \( s \) (entropy) in \( \frac{J}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \).  

The diagram includes several labeled processes:  
- A point labeled "1" marks the initial state.  
- A curve labeled "isentropic" connects state 1 to state 2.  
- A zigzag line labeled "combustion" connects state 2 to state 3.  
- A horizontal line labeled "adiabatic, irreversible" connects state 3 to state 4.  
- A curve labeled "turbine" connects state 4 to state 5.  
- A curve labeled "nozzle" connects state 5 to state 6.
