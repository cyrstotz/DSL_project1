The page begins with a graph labeled as a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are marked as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), representing temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled \( s \, \left[\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}\right] \), representing specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.  

The diagram depicts a thermodynamic process with the following states and transitions:  
- State 1 to State 2: Isentropic compression (vertical line).  
- State 2 to State 3: Isobaric heat addition (curved line).  
- State 3 to State 4: Isentropic expansion (vertical line).  
- State 4 to State 5: Isobaric heat rejection (horizontal line).  
- State 5 to State 6: Isentropic compression (curved line).  
- State 6 to State 1: Isobaric heat rejection (horizontal line).
