The internal energy of the ice-water mixture is calculated using the formula:  
\[
U = U_s + x (U_f - U_s),
\]
where \( x \) is the ice fraction. Solving for \( x \):  
\[
x = \frac{U - U_s}{U_f - U_s}.
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
x = \frac{-315.785 + 333.458}{-0.045 + 333.458}.
\]

The internal energy per unit mass of the gas is given by:  
\[
U = -\frac{Q_{12}}{m_g} = -\frac{315.785}{m_g}.
\]

The ice fraction \( x \) is calculated as:  
\[
x = 0.0529.
\]

The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is expressed as a percentage:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 5.29\%.
\]
