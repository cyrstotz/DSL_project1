The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes labeled phase regions for gas, liquid, and solid. The graph shows the following transitions:  
- An isobaric evaporation process at state 2, 6 K below \(T_i\).  
- A reversible adiabatic compression from state 2 to state 3.  
- An isobaric condensation at state 4.  
- An adiabatic expansion from state 4 to state 1.  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The \(y\)-axis represents pressure (\(p\)) in bar, ranging from 0.01 to 10 bar.  
- The \(x\)-axis represents temperature (\(T\)) in degrees Celsius, ranging from approximately \(-50^\circ\text{C}\) to \(10^\circ\text{C}\).  

Key points are marked on the graph:  
- State 2 is labeled as "saturated cooling vapor."  
- State 3 is labeled at \(p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar}\).  
- State 4 is labeled as "fully condensed refrigerant."  
- State 1 is labeled after adiabatic expansion.
