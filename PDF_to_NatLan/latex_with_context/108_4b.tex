The vapor quality at state 1 is given as \( x_1 = 1 \).  
The pressures at state 2 and state 3 are \( p_2 = p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \), and the vapor quality at state 3 is \( x_3 = 0 \).  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) = \dot{W}_K
\]  
where \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate, \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are enthalpies, and \( \dot{W}_K \) is the work input to the compressor.  

Entropy values are noted as \( s_2 = s_3 \).  
The pressure at state 4 is \( p_4 = p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \), and the internal chamber pressure is \( p_{\text{Innenraum}} = 1 \, \text{bar} \).
