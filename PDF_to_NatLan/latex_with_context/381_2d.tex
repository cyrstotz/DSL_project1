The page contains calculations and expressions related to exergy and energy balances in a turbine system.  

The exergy equation is written as:  
\[
O = \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}}
\]  
\[
O = \dot{Q}_{\text{estr}} + \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_j}\right) \dot{Q}_j - \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}} - \text{Ex}_{\text{verlust}}
\]  

Further simplifications are shown:  
\[
\text{Ex}_{\text{verlust}} = \dot{Q}_{\text{estr}} - \dot{W}_{\text{turbine}}
\]  
\[
= 100 \, \frac{\text{MJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

There is a note regarding the turbine:  
"Logically, the adiabatic turbine is considered."  

An energy balance for the turbine is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{\dot{W}_{\text{turbine}}}{\dot{m}} = \frac{(h_3 - h_4)}{c_V (T_3 - T_4)} + \dot{Q}_j
\]  

No diagrams or additional figures are present on this page.

The change in flow exergy \( \Delta ex_{\text{flow}} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{flow}} = ex_6 - ex_0
\]

The detailed expression for \( ex_6 - ex_0 \) is:  
\[
(n_6 - e_0) - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + p_0 \left( V_6 - V_0 \right)
\]

Breaking this down further:  
\[
= c_p (T_6 - T_0) - T_0 \, c_p \left( \frac{T_c}{T_1} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) + p_0 (V_6 - V_0)
\]

Additional relationships are provided:  
\[
V_0 = \frac{R \, T}{p_0}, \quad V_6 = \frac{R \, T}{p_0}
\]

The gas constant \( R \) is expressed as:  
\[
R = c_p \left( 1 - \frac{1}{r_c} \right)
\]

The heat capacity ratio \( c_v \) is given as:  
\[
c_v = \frac{c_p}{r_c}
\]
