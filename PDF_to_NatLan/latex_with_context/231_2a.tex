The diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( s \)) diagram.  
- The x-axis represents entropy (\( s \)) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \), and the y-axis represents temperature (\( T \)) in Kelvin (\( K \)).  
- The process begins with compression in the "Verdichter" (compressor), shown as an upward curve.  
- An isobaric heat addition ("isobare Wärmezufuhr") occurs, represented by a horizontal line.  
- The turbine process is shown as a downward curve.  
- The diagram includes labeled points \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \), indicating pressure states, and a constant temperature line ("T-const").  
- The shaded region represents the turbine's work output.
