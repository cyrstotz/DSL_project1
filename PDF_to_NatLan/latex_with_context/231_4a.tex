A graph is drawn showing pressure \( P \) (in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The graph represents the phase regions of a refrigeration cycle. The curve includes labeled points 1, 2, 3, and 4, corresponding to different states in the cycle.  
- Region I is marked above the curve, indicating the superheated vapor region.  
- Region II is marked below the curve, indicating the subcooled liquid region.  
- The curve itself represents the phase change boundary between liquid and vapor.  
Arrows indicate transitions between states:  
- From state 1 to state 2, the process involves isobaric evaporation.  
- From state 2 to state 3, the process involves compression.  
- From state 3 to state 4, the process involves isobaric condensation.  
- From state 4 back to state 1, the process involves adiabatic expansion.
