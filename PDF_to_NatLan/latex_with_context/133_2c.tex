The following calculations are shown:  

1. Determination of \( T_c \) and \( T_s \):  
\[
T_c = \frac{p_2}{p_0} \cdot T_s = 328.075 \, \text{K}
\]

2. Velocity calculations:  
\[
w_c = v_6 = 437.427 \, \text{m/s}
\]
\[
v_s = \frac{R T_s}{p_s} = 0.00248 \, \text{m/s}
\]

3. Thermodynamic constants:  
\[
R = c_p - c_v = 0.2874
\]
\[
\kappa = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = 0.719
\]

4. Specific volume:  
\[
v_g = \frac{R T_c}{p_6} = 0.0049 \, \text{kg/m}^3
\]  

Several crossed-out calculations are ignored.

Description of Figures  
The graph visually represents the thermodynamic processes in the jet engine, including compression, combustion, expansion, and mixing. States are clearly labeled, and the entropy changes are depicted qualitatively.

The equation for the exergy destruction is given as:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = ex_{\text{str,c}} - ex_{\text{str,o}}
\]  
Substituting the terms:  
\[
\Delta ex_{\text{str}} = \dot{m} \left( h_a - h_c - T_0 (s_a - s_c) + \Delta u_e \right) = 87.829 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The enthalpy difference is calculated as:  
\[
h_a - h_c = c_p (T_c - T_0) = 85.928 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  
where \( T_0 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \).  

The entropy difference is:  
\[
s_a - s_c = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_c}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_c}{p_0} \right) = 0.30136 \, \text{kJ/(kgÂ·K)}
\]  

The change in kinetic energy is:  
\[
\Delta u_e = \frac{w_e^2}{2} - \frac{w_c^2}{2} = 75.6 + 4.19 = 75.819 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]
