The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is related to the energy balance of the gas:  
\[
\Delta E = \Delta E_{12} + Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]  
The work \( W_{12} \) is expressed as:  
\[
W_{12} = \int_{1}^{2} p \, dV = p_{\text{amb}} (V_2 - V_1) = -434.26 \, \text{J}
\]  
The volume \( V_2 \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{R T_2}{p_{\text{amb}}} = 3.04 \, \text{L}
\]  
The energy change is given by:  
\[
\Delta E = m_{g,1} \cdot c_V (T_{2} - T_{g,1}) = Q_{12}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 1199.4 \, \text{J}
\]  
This result matches the expected value.
