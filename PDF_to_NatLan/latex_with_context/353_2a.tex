The process is illustrated in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars and states (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The following details are provided:  
- \( p_z = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( T_0 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( s_1 = s_2 \), \( s_3 = s_4 \), \( p_1 = p_4 = p_5 \), \( p_6 = p_0 \), \( s_5 = s_6 \).  

The diagram shows the thermodynamic process with transitions between states, including compression, combustion, and expansion phases.
