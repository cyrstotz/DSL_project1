The goal is to determine the mass flow rate of the refrigerant (\( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \)).  

From the energy balance equation:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}_k
\]  
Here:  
- \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \) is the refrigerant mass flow rate.  
- \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are enthalpies at states 2 and 3, respectively.  
- \( \dot{Q} \) represents the heat transfer rate.  
- \( \dot{W}_k \) is the work done by the compressor.  

Note: The term \( \dot{Q} \) is crossed out in the equation.
