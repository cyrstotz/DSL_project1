The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  
This is because during the state change, no additional mass is added to counteract \( p_{g} \). The EW (ice-water mixture) has constant mass and volume.  

The temperature \( T \) of the ice is also constant because the phase state does not change under constant \( p \) and \( T \).  

The crossed-out equation:  
\[
T = \frac{DV}{mRT}
\]  
is incorrect because \( V \) decreases with \( T \), while other variables remain constant.
