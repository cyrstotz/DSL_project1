The outlet velocity \( w_6 \) and temperature \( T_6 \) are calculated as follows:  

The temperature ratio is given by:  
\[
\frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]  
\[
T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}}
\]  
\[
T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K}
\]  

The ambient temperature \( T_0 \) is also noted as \( T_0 = 328.07 \, \text{K} \).
