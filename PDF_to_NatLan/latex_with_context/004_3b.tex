The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) and mass \( m_g \) in state 2 are given as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 1.5 \, \text{bar}, \quad m_g = 3.6 \, \text{g}
\]  

It is stated that \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.5 \, \text{bar} \) because the mass of the ice-water mixture (\( m_{\text{EW}} \)) remains constant.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to \( T_{\text{EW},2} \), which is \( 0^\circ\text{C} \), because \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \).
