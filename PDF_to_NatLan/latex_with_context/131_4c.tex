The following equations and notes are written:  
- The energy balance is expressed as:  
  \[
  \frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
  \]  
- The enthalpy at state 1 is written as:  
  \[
  h_1 = h_f + A - 11 \, (\text{Joule})
  \]  
  where \( h_f = 53.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  
- The enthalpy at state 2 is written as:  
  \[
  h_2(T, p) \quad \text{(to be determined based on temperature and pressure)}  
  \]  
- The vapor quality \( x \) is calculated using:  
  \[
  x = \frac{h - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
  \]
