The mass flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\Delta h_{1/4}}
\]  
The temperature at state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_2 = -22^\circ\text{C}
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the following relation:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{S_1 - S_{f,1}}{S_{g,1} - S_{f,1}}
\]  
where \( S_1 \) is the entropy at state 1, and \( S_{f,1} \) and \( S_{g,1} \) are the saturated liquid and saturated vapor entropies at state 1, respectively.  

The entropy at state 1 is determined as:  
\[
S_1 = S_f(T_1) + 0.3643 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  
Here, \( S_f(T_1) \) corresponds to the saturated liquid entropy at \( T_1 = -22^\circ\text{C} \).  

The saturated liquid entropy \( S_f \) is calculated using the temperature \( T_1 = -22^\circ\text{C} \).  

In state 1, the system transitions to state 2, where the cooling process occurs from state 1 to state 2.
