The table provided lists values for different states in the jet engine process:  

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{State (Z)} & p \, [\text{bar}] & T \, [\text{K}] & h & s \\
\hline
1 & & & & \\
2 & & & & \\
3 & & & & \\
4 & & & & \\
5 & 0.5 & 431.9 & & \\
6 & 0.191 & 328.075 & & \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Below the table, a graph is drawn representing the temperature \( T \) versus entropy \( s \).  

The graph shows the thermodynamic process of the jet engine in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram:  
- The process begins at state 1 and moves to state 2, labeled as "isentropic compression."  
- From state 2 to state 3, there is a heat addition process.  
- State 3 to state 4 is labeled "adiabatic expansion."  
- States 4 to 5 and 5 to 6 are shown as further processes, with state 6 labeled "exit."  
- The axes are labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \) for temperature and \( s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}] \) for entropy.
