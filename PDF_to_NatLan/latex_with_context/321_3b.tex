The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]  
This is because the weight of the piston and the weight of the ice-water mixture, as well as the ambient pressure, do not change.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is calculated using the heat transfer equation:  
\[
T_{g,2} = \frac{0.2 \, \text{kg} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K} + 3.4217 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K}}{0.2 \, \text{kg} + 3.4217 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg}}
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
T_{g,2} = 289.694 \, \text{K} = 16.54^\circ\text{C}
\]
