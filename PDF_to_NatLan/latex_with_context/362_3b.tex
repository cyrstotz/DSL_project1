Since \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \) and the temperature is homogeneous throughout the system, \( T_{g,2} \) must equal \( T_{12} = 0^\circ\text{C} \) at constant \( p = 1.1 \, \text{bar} \).  

In the two-phase region, \( p \) remains constant at \( 1.1 \, \text{bar} \), and the temperature is \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) according to the equilibrium table.  

The pressure also remains constant because \( p_{\text{atm}} \) and \( m_K \) are constant.
