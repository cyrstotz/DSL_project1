The gas pressure in state 2, \( p_{g,2} \), is equal to \( p_{g,1} \):  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  
This is because the same pressure from atmospheric conditions and the piston weight still applies.  

For the polytropic process, the following equation is used:  
\[
k = \frac{R + c_V}{c_V} = 1.263
\]  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is calculated using the polytropic relation:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \cdot \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{k-1}{k}} = 773.75 \, \text{K}
\]
