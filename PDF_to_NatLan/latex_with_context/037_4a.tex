The diagram shows a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph. It includes a phase diagram with a curved boundary separating different phase regions. The boundary line is labeled with a wavy pattern, indicating phase transitions. The axes are labeled as follows:
- \(p\) (pressure) on the vertical axis.
- \(T\) (temperature) on the horizontal axis.
Another smaller graph is drawn to the right, showing a simplified \(p\)-\(T\) relationship with linear axes labeled \(p\) (in \(\text{bar}\)) and \(T\) (in \(\text{K}\)).
