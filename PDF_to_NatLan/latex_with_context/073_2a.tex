A graph is drawn representing the thermodynamic process in a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is \( s \) (specific entropy in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)).  

The graph includes the following features:  
- Points labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4,5 \), and \( 6 \) represent different states in the process.  
- Two dashed curves are drawn, representing isobars: \( p = p_L \) (lower pressure) and \( p = p_A \) (higher pressure).  
- The process transitions between these states, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.

The energy balance equation for the jet engine is written as:  
\[
\dot{E}_{\text{in}} = \dot{E}_{\text{out}} \quad \text{(valid for reversible processes)}
\]  

The equation for the work done by the turbine is expressed as:  
\[
O = \dot{m} \left( h_s - h_c - T_c (s_s - s_c) + \frac{\alpha k e}{2} \right) - \dot{W}_t
\]  

The turbine work is given by:  
\[
\dot{W}_t = \frac{R (T_G - T_S)}{1 - \kappa} \quad \text{(ideal gas and isentropic process)}
\]  

The work done by the turbine can also be expressed as:  
\[
W_t = \dot{m} \cdot c_p \cdot \Delta T
\]  

Substituting into the energy balance equation:  
\[
O = \dot{m} \left( h_s - h_c - T_c (s_s - s_c) + \frac{1}{2} (w_0^2 - w_s^2) \right) - \frac{R (T_G - T_S)}{1 - \kappa} - \dot{m} \cdot c_p \cdot \Delta T
\]  

Rearranging terms:  
\[
\frac{R (T_G - T_S)}{1 - \kappa} = h_s - h_c - T_c (s_s - s_c) + \frac{1}{2} w_s^2 - \frac{1}{2} w_0^2
\]  

The entropy difference is expressed as:  
\[
s_s - s_c = c_p \ln \frac{T_s}{T_G} - R \ln \frac{p_s}{p_G}
\]  

The enthalpy difference is expressed as:  
\[
h_c - h_s = c_p (T_G - T_S)
\]  

Substituting these into the equation:  
\[
\frac{1}{2} w_G^2 = \frac{R (T_G - T_S)}{1 - \kappa} + \frac{1}{2} w_s^2 + T_c \left[ c_p \ln \frac{T_s}{T_G} - R \ln \frac{p_s}{p_G} \right] + c_p (T_G - T_S)
\]  

Finally, solving for \( w_G \):  
\[
w_G = \sqrt{\frac{2 R (T_G - T_S)}{1 - \kappa} - w_s^2 + 2 T_c \left[ c_p \ln \frac{T_s}{T_G} - R \ln \frac{p_s}{p_G} \right] + c_p (T_G - T_S)}
\]
