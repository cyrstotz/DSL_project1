A graph is drawn representing a T-s diagram (temperature-entropy diagram). The diagram includes labeled isobars \( p_2 \), \( p_3 \), \( p_4 \), \( p_5 \), and \( p_6 \). The states are numbered from 1 to 6, with arrows indicating the process flow. The graph shows the qualitative behavior of the thermodynamic process, including compression, heat addition, expansion, and mixing. The axis labels are:  
- \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis.  
- \( s \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis.  

The isobars are curved lines, and the transitions between states are marked with arrows. The process appears to include adiabatic compression, isobaric heat addition, and adiabatic expansion.
