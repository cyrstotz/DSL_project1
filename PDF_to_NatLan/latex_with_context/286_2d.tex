The problem involves calculating the exergy destruction in the engine.  

### Exergy Destruction Equation  
\[
Ex_{\text{dest}} = \dot{m} \cdot ex_{\text{flow}} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) Q - \Delta Ex
\]  

The student outlines the relationship between exergy destruction and changes in flow exergy, heat transfer, and temperature ratios.  

### Final Expression  
\[
\Delta Ex = \Delta Ex_{\text{flow}} + \Delta Ex_{ke}
\]  

No numerical values are calculated for this part.
