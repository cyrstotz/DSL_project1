A graph is drawn showing a pressure (\(p\)) versus temperature (\(T\)) diagram. The curve represents the refrigeration cycle. The labeled points on the graph are:  
- Point \(3\): The start of the adiabatic compression process.  
- Point \(1\): The end of the adiabatic expansion process.  
Arrows indicate the direction of the processes between these points.
