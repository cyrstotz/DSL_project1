The phase diagram is described with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled isobaric and isothermal processes for states 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- State 1: Isobaric and isothermal evaporation.  
- State 2: Isentropic compression.  
- State 3: Isobaric condensation.  
- State 4: Isentropic and isothermal expansion.
