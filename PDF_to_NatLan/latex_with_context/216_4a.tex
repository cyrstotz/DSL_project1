The page contains two diagrams:  

1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph. It shows a curve representing the phase regions of a substance. The curve peaks at a critical point labeled "crit." The x-axis is labeled \(T\) in Kelvin (\(T \, \text{in K}\)), and the y-axis is labeled \(p\) in bar (\(p \, \text{in bar}\)).  

2. The second diagram is a triangular cycle diagram, also plotted on a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) graph. The cycle is labeled with four states: \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), and \(4\). The x-axis is labeled \(T\) in Kelvin (\(T \, \text{in K}\)), and the y-axis is labeled \(p\) in bar (\(p \, \text{in bar}\)).
