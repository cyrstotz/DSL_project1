\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ s_{\text{ein}} - s_{\text{aus}} \right] + \frac{-\dot{Q}_{\text{gas}}}{T} + \frac{\dot{Q}_{R}}{T} - \dot{S}_{\text{EV2}}
\]

The internal energy of the gas is calculated as follows:

\[
\Delta U = m \cdot u_2 - m \cdot u_1
\]

\[
= m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]

\[
= 0.00293 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot \left[ (0.003 \cdot 273.15) - (500 + 273.15) \, \text{K} \right]
\]

\[
= -0.927 \, \text{J}
\]

The work done by the gas is expressed as:

\[
W_{u,12} = m \int p \, dv
\]

The polytropic index \( n \) is determined as:

\[
n = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = \frac{R + c_v}{c_v}
\]

\[
n = 1.263
\]

The work done is then calculated as:

\[
W_{u,12} = m \cdot \frac{R \cdot (T_2 - T_1)}{1 - n}
\]

\[
= 0.926 \, \text{J}
\]

The equation for heat transfer is given as:  
\[
\dot{m} \left( h_u - h_1 \right) = 0
\]  
This implies:  
\[
h_u = h_1
\]  
From the table A-11, the value of \( h_1 \) is determined to be:  
\[
h_1 = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

Additionally, the temperature is noted as:  
\[
T_u = T_1
\]
