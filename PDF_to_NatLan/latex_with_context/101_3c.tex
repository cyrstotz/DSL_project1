The initial temperature is given as \( T_1 = 773.15 \, \text{K} \). The equilibrium temperature of the gas and ice-water mixture is \( T_{g2} = 0.003^\circ\text{C} = 273.153 \, \text{K} \).  

The heat transferred, \( Q_{12} \), is calculated using the formula:  
\[
Q_{12} = C_v \cdot m \cdot \Delta T
\]  
where \( C_v = 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \), \( m = 2.8 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \), and \( \Delta T = T_1 - T_{g2} = 773.147 \, \text{K} \).  

Substituting the values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 0.633 \cdot 2.8 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 773.147 = 1.375 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
Thus, \( Q_{12} = 1.375 \, \text{kJ} \).

The equation shown represents an energy balance or exergy equation:  

\[
0 = \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \left( h_1 - h_0 - T_0 (s_1 - s_0) \right) = 0
\]  

Here, \( \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \) is the total mass flow rate, \( h_1 \) and \( h_0 \) are specific enthalpies at states 1 and 0, \( T_0 \) is the reference temperature, and \( s_1 \) and \( s_0 \) are specific entropies at states 1 and 0.
