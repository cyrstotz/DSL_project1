The second state is described with no work being performed. The mass of the gas remains constant.  

The energy balance is written as:  
\[
m_g \cdot u_2 = m_g \cdot u_1
\]

This simplifies to:  
\[
u_2 = u_1
\]

Further simplification leads to:  
\[
c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1) = 0
\]

Thus, the temperature difference between states 2 and 1 is zero:  
\[
T_2 = T_1
\]  

Some crossed-out text is ignored.
