The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
\Delta E = m_2 u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_{12} + Q_{R,12} - W
\]  
where \( W \) is crossed out and considered negligible.  

The following relationships and values are used:  
\[
m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12}
\]  
\[
u_2 = u_w(70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.95 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
u_1 = u_w(100^\circ\text{C}) = 418.97 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg}
\]  
\[
m_2 = 5755 \, \text{kg} + \Delta m_{12}
\]  
\[
h_{12} = 83.96 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
These values are taken from Table A2.  

Rewriting the energy balance equation:  
\[
m_1 u_2 + \Delta m_{12} u_2 - m_1 u_1 = \Delta m_{12} h_{12} + Q_{R,12}
\]  
Simplifying further:  
\[
\Delta m_{12} (u_2 - h_{12}) = Q_{R,12} + m_1 u_1 - m_1 u_2
\]  
Solving for \( \Delta m_{12} \):  
\[
\Delta m_{12} \approx 3500 \, \text{kg}
\]
