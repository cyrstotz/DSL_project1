The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined as follows:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} \quad \text{(otherwise heat would continue to flow)}
\]  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \quad \text{(since the mass of the gas remains constant)}
\]  

The ideal gas law is used again:  
\[
p \cdot V = n \cdot R \cdot T
\]
