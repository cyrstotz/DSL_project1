A graph is drawn showing the freeze-drying process in a \( p \)-\( T \) diagram. The diagram includes labeled phase regions: "Fest" (solid), "Fest + Gas" (solid + gas), and "Gas" (gas). The curve represents the phase boundary between solid and gas. Points \( 1 \), \( 2 \), and \( 3 \) are marked along the curve, with arrows indicating transitions between states. The pressure axis (\( p \)) is vertical, and the temperature axis (\( T \)) is horizontal.
