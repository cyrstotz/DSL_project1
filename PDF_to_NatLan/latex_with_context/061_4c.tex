The enthalpy at state 4 is given as \( h_4 = 93.42 \). The entropy at state 4 is \( S_4 = 0.3459 \).  

The pressure at state 2 is equal to the pressure at state 4:  
\[
p_2 = p_4 = 7.5788 \, \text{bar}
\]  

The mass flow rate equation is written as:  
\[
\dot{m}(h_1 - h_4) = 0
\]  

It is stated that \( h_1 = h_4 \), therefore:  
\[
h_1 = 93.42
\]  

The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{93.42 - 29.30}{208.45} = 0.3076
\]
