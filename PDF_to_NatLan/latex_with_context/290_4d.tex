The coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{\dot{W}_K}
\]  

- Heat transfer:  
  \[
  \dot{Q}_K = m \left( h_2 - h_4 \right)  
  \]  
- The student notes that \( h_4 \) is uncertain due to missing data.  

No further calculations are provided for \( \epsilon_K \).
