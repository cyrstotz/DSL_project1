The condition \( x_{\text{ice},2} > 0 \) implies that the ice fraction remains nonzero in state 2.  

The energy balance is written as:  
\[
\Delta E_g = \Delta E_{\text{EW}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta E_g - \Delta E_{\text{EW}} = 0
\]  

The change in energy for the gas is:  
\[
\Delta E_g = \Delta U = m_g c_V (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

The change in energy for the ice-water mixture is:  
\[
\Delta E_{\text{EW}} = \Delta U = m_{\text{EW}} (u_2 - u_1)
\]
