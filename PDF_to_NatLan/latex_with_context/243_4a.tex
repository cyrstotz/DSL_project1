Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) plot. It shows phase regions labeled as "liquid," "vapor," and "mixed phase." The curve represents the phase boundary between these regions.  
2. The second diagram is another \(p\)-\(T\) plot. It includes a labeled point for \(T_i\) and arrows indicating the cooling process. The curve represents the refrigerant cycle, with labels for "R134a" and "phase transitions."
