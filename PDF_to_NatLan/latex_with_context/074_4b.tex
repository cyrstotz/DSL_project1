Using Table A11, the enthalpy values for the given states are determined:  

For \( h_1 \) at \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) and \( x = 0 \):  
\[
h_1 = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

For \( h_2 \) at \( -16^\circ\text{C} \) and \( x = 1 \):  
\[
h_2 = 240.15 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

The temperature \( T_1 \) is calculated as:  
\[
T_1 = -20^\circ\text{C} - (-6^\circ\text{C}) = -16^\circ\text{C}
\]  

For stationary flow processes, the energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a \right] + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  

Simplifying for this specific case:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_a - h_2 \right]
\]

A table is provided to describe the cooling cycle. It includes the following states:  
1. Pressure (\(p\)) is \(p_0\).  
2. Pressure (\(p\)) is \(p_0 - 16^\circ\text{C}\), and the vapor quality (\(x_2\)) is equal to 1.  
3. Pressure (\(p\)) is \(8 \, \text{bar}\).  
4. Pressure (\(p\)) is \(8 \, \text{bar}\), and the vapor quality (\(x_4\)) is equal to 0.  

The refrigerant enters at state 1 and undergoes changes in pressure and temperature as it moves through the cycle. The heat transfer (\(h_q\)) and work (\(\dot{Q}_K\)) are indicated in the table.  

The initial temperature (\(T_i\)) is determined from the diagram as \(T_i = -20^\circ\text{C}\).
