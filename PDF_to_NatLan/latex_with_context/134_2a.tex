The page includes a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The diagram is labeled with states \( 1 \) through \( 6 \), showing the following features:  
- The process begins at state \( 1 \) and moves to state \( 2 \) with an increase in entropy.  
- Between states \( 2 \) and \( 3 \), the process is labeled "isentropic," indicating constant entropy.  
- From state \( 3 \) to \( 4 \), the process is labeled "isobaric," showing a significant increase in entropy.  
- States \( 4 \) to \( 5 \) and \( 5 \) to \( 6 \) are also marked, with state \( 6 \) labeled "isobaric \( p_s = p_0 \)."  
- The axes are labeled: \( T \) (temperature in \( ^\circ \text{C} \)) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (entropy in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)) on the horizontal axis.
