The vapor quality \( x_1 \) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_{fg}}
\]  
where \( h_f \) is the enthalpy of the saturated liquid, \( h_{fg} \) is the enthalpy of vaporization, and \( h_1 \) is the enthalpy at state 1.  

It is stated that \( x_4 = 0 \), meaning the refrigerant is fully condensed at state 4.  

The pressure \( p_1 \) and enthalpy \( h_4 \) are also referenced but not further elaborated.
