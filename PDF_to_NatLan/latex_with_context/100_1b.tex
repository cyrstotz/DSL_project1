The thermodynamic mean temperature \( \bar{T}_{\text{KF}} \) of the coolant is calculated using the following formula:  

\[
\bar{T}_{\text{KF}} = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{\ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)} = 293.12
\]

Where \( T_2 \) and \( T_1 \) are the outlet and inlet temperatures of the coolant, respectively.
