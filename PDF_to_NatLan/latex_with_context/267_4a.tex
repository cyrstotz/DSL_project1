Two diagrams are drawn to represent the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (\( p-T \)) diagram.  

- The first diagram shows phase regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous). The triple point is marked, and arrows indicate transitions between states:  
  - State 1 (\( T_1 \)) is in the gaseous region.  
  - State 2 (\( T_2 \)) is in the liquid region.  
  - State 3 (\( T_3 \)) is in the solid region.  

- The second diagram similarly shows the phase regions "fest," "flüssig," and "gasförmig," with the triple point labeled. Arrows indicate transitions between states, but the layout is slightly simplified.
