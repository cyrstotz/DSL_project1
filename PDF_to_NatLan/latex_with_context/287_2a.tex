The diagram is a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) plot representing the thermodynamic process of a jet engine. It includes labeled points for states \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The process transitions are described as follows:  
- From \( 1 \) to \( 2 \): Isentropic compression.  
- From \( 2 \) to \( 3 \): Isobaric heat addition.  
- From \( 3 \) to \( 5 \): Adiabatic expansion.  
- From \( 5 \) to \( 6 \): Isobaric mixing at \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- From \( 6 \): Isobaric nozzle exit at \( 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  

The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (specific entropy), with units indicated.
