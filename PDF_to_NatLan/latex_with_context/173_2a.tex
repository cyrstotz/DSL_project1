The page begins with a graph illustrating the thermodynamic process in a jet engine. The graph is a \( T \)-\( S \) diagram (temperature vs. entropy) with labeled isobars and states. The following features are visible:  
- States 0 through 6 are marked along the process path.  
- Isobars are labeled as \( p_0 = p_6 \), \( p_2 = p_3 \), and \( p_4 = p_5 \).  
- The process includes compression, combustion, and expansion stages, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
