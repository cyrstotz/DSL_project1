A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \, [\text{bar}] \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \, [^\circ\text{C}] \) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows phase regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "gas."  
- The solid-liquid phase boundary is represented by a curve.  
- The liquid-gas phase boundary is marked with an isobar, and the region is labeled "isobar."  
- A point labeled "2" is marked on the isobar within the liquid-gas region.
