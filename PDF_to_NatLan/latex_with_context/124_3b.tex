Since \( x > 0 \), the system is in equilibrium, meaning not all the ice has melted. Therefore, the ice-water mixture remains at the equilibrium temperature of \( 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

The pressure in this case is independent of the gas and depends only on the mass of the water/ice, the weight, and the external pressure, which remains constant without mass exchange.
