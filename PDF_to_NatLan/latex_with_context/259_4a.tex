A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) (in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in degrees Celsius) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts the freeze-drying process.  
- Two regions are labeled: "test" and "fissing gas."  
- Two steps are marked as \( (i) \) and \( (ii) \), with arrows indicating transitions between states.  
- The graph includes phase boundaries and transitions, but specific numerical values are not provided.

The coefficient of performance \( e_K \) is defined as:  
\[
e_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{2a}}{\dot{Q}_{0b} - \dot{Q}_{2a}}
\]
