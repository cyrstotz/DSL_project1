The pressure in state 2 is equal to the pressure in state 1:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}.
\]  
This is because the mass of the ice-water mixture does not change, and thus the weight remains constant.  

The temperature in state 2 is given as:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2}.
\]  
The ice mass fraction remains unchanged:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},2} = 0.6.
\]  

The volume of the gas in state 2 is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{m_g RT}{p}.
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{0.00342 \cdot 166.28 \cdot 273.15}{1.401 \times 10^5}
\]  
\[
V_2 = 0.00116 \, \text{m}^3.
\]
