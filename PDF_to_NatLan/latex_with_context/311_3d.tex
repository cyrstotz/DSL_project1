The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
T_{\text{EW}} = T_{2,\text{EW}}
\]  

The mass of the ice-water mixture (\(m_{\text{EW}}\)) is expressed as:  
\[
m_{\text{EW}} = m_{W,2} + m_{E,2}
\]  

The mass of the ice (\(m_{E,2}\)) is calculated as:  
\[
m_{E,2} = m_{\text{EW}} - m_{W,2}
\]  

The energy balance for the system is given by:  
\[
m_{W,2} U_{2,W} + m_{E,2} U_{2,E} = m_{W,1} U_{W,1} + m_{E,1} U_{E,1} + Q_{12}
\]  

The specific internal energy values are provided:  
\[
U_{W,1} = -0.045 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad U_{E,1} = 333.458 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The mass fractions are calculated as:  
\[
m_{W,1} = 0.4 \, \text{m}_{\text{EW}} = 0.04 \, \text{kg}
\]  
\[
m_{E,1} = 0.6 \, \text{m}_{\text{EW}} = 0.06 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The energy balance is rearranged:  
\[
m_{W,2} U_{2,W} + (m_{\text{EW}} - m_{W,2}) U_{2,E} = m_{W,1} U_{W,1} + m_{E,1} U_{E,1} + Q_{12}
\]  

Solving for \(m_{W,2}\):  
\[
m_{W,2} (U_{2,W} - U_{2,E}) = m_{W,1} U_{W,1} + m_{E,1} U_{E,1} + Q_{12} - m_{\text{EW}} U_{2,E}
\]  

The final mass of water (\(m_{W,2}\)) is calculated as:  
\[
m_{W,2} = 0.044483 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The final mass of ice (\(m_{E,2}\)) is determined:  
\[
m_{E,2} = 0.056 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The final ice fraction (\(x_{E,2}\)) is given by:  
\[
x_{E,2} = 0.555
\]
