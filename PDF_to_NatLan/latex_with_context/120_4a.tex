The diagram shows a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) plot for the freeze-drying process. The graph includes labeled regions for "Dampf" (vapor), "Nassdampf" (wet vapor), and "Sumpf" (liquid). The process steps are marked as points 1, 2, and 3, with arrows indicating transitions between states. The temperature \( T_i \) is given as \( 10^\circ\text{C} \).
