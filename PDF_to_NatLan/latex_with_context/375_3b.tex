The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \) because the same pressure acts on the system:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 140084 \, \text{Pa}
\]  

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is zero because the process is adiabatic:  
\[
\Delta U = 0
\]  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = m_g (\Delta U) + m
\]
