The energy balance for the compressor and the system is described.  

The work per unit mass flow rate is expressed as:  
\[
\frac{\dot{W}_k}{\dot{m}} = w_k = \int v \, dp
\]  
This leads to:  
\[
w_k = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{\dot{m}}
\]  

Temperature relationships are partially written but crossed out. The energy balance equation is given as:  
\[
\Delta U = q - W
\]

The refrigerant mass flow rate (\(m_R\)) is calculated using an energy balance approach.  

A table is provided with the following information:  
- Row 1: "NO reg sat"  
- Row 2: "vap sat" — Reference to Table A-10 at state \(1\), with \(p_2 = p_1\).  
- Row 3: "VSupen." — Reference to Table A-15 at state \(2\), with pressure \(p = 8\).  
- Row 4: "liq sat" — Value \(31.33\).  

No further numerical calculations or explanations are visible.  

Descriptions of the diagrams and table are provided as written.
