The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
-28W - 157.6W + \dot{Q}_K = 0
\]  
Solving for the heat transfer rate:  
\[
\dot{Q}_K = 225.6W
\]  

The general energy balance for the system is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{m}(h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q} = 0
\]  

Rearranging to find \( h_1 \):  
\[
h_1 = -\frac{\dot{Q}}{\dot{m}} + h_2
\]  

No further numerical values or calculations are provided for \( h_2 \).
