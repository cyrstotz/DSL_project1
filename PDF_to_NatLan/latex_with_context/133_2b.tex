A graph is drawn representing a \( T \)-\( s \) diagram (temperature vs. entropy). The process is labeled with states 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  

- State 0: Starting point at low temperature and entropy.  
- State 1: Compression process, entropy remains constant.  
- State 2: Combustion process, temperature increases significantly.  
- State 3: Expansion process, temperature decreases.  
- State 4: Mixing process, entropy increases slightly.  
- State 5: Final state at lower temperature and entropy.  

The axes are labeled:  
- \( T \) (K) for temperature.  
- \( s \, (\text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K}) \) for entropy.
