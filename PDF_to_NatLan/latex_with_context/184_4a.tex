The initial temperature is given as \( T_i = 0^\circ\text{C} \).  

Two graphs are drawn:  
1. The first graph is a pressure-volume (\( p \)-\( v \)) diagram. It shows several curves, including one labeled "nicht beachtet" (not considered). The curves represent different thermodynamic states, with one curve crossing over a peak and others diverging.  
2. The second graph is also a \( p \)-\( v \) diagram. It includes labeled regions for "gasförmig" (gaseous), "flüssig" (liquid), and "fest" (solid). A rectangular cycle is drawn with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, representing transitions between phases. The cycle moves through the regions of "flüssig" (liquid) and "gasförmig" (gaseous).
