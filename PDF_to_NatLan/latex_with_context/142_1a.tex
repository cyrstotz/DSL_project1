The reactor has the following parameters:  
- Total mass: \( m_{\text{total}} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \)  
- Inlet mass flow rate: \( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \)  
- Heat released by the chemical reaction: \( \dot{Q}_R = 100 \, \text{kW} \)  

The inlet and outlet conditions are:  
- Outlet temperature: \( T_{\text{out}} = 100^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Inlet temperature: \( T_{\text{in}} = 70^\circ\text{C} \)  
- Enthalpy at inlet: \( q_{\text{in}} = 292.93 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) (from water tables A-2 to A-3)  
- Pressure: \( p = 10 \, \text{bar} \), density at inlet: \( \rho_{\text{in}} = 0.3713 \, \text{kg/L} \)  
- Steam quality: \( x_D = 0.005 \)  

The reactor temperature is \( T_{\text{Reactor}} = 100^\circ\text{C} \).  
The enthalpy at outlet is calculated as \( q_{\text{out}} = 440.04 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) (from water tables A-2).  

Coolant conditions:  
- Coolant inlet temperature: \( T_{\text{KF,in}} = 288.15 \, \text{K} \)  
- Coolant outlet temperature: \( T_{\text{KF,out}} = 298.15 \, \text{K} \)
