The final ice fraction \( x_{\text{ice},2} \) is determined.  

The heat \( Q \) is expressed as:  
\[
Q = m_{\text{EW}} (u_2 - u_1)
\]  

The internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated as:  
\[
u_2 = u_{\text{ice}} + x \cdot (u_{\text{water}} - u_{\text{ice}})
\]  

Values used:  
\[
u_{\text{ice}} = -444.23 \, \text{kJ/kg}, \quad u_{\text{water}} = -122.59 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]  

The heat transfer equation is:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_{\text{EW}} c_{\text{EW}} (T_{\text{EW},2} - T_{\text{EW},1})
\]  

It is noted that:  
\[
Q + T_{\text{EW},1} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  

The volume relationship is described as:  
\[
V_A = V_2 = \text{constant}
\]  

No further numerical results are provided for \( x_{\text{ice},2} \).
