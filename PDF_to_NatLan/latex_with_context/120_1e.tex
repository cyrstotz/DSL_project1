The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to 2 is calculated using the equation:  
\[
\Delta S = \Delta m \cdot s_i + \frac{Q_{12}}{T}.
\]  

From the water tables:  
\[
s_i = 0.2966 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \quad \text{(at 20°C, \( x = 0 \))}.
\]  

Substituting the values:  
\[
\Delta S = 8205.67 \cdot 0.2966 + \frac{35000}{293}.
\]  

Calculating:  
\[
\Delta S = 945.11 \, \text{kJ/K}.
\]

Description of the diagram:  
The diagram shows a rectangular reactor with labeled states. The initial state is \( T_1 = 100^\circ\text{C} \), \( m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg} \), and \( x = 0.005 \). The final state is \( T_2 = 70^\circ\text{C} \), \( x = 0 \). An arrow indicates the addition of \( \Delta m_{12} \) at \( T = 20^\circ\text{C} \), and the heat released during cooling is labeled as \( Q_{12} = 35 \, \text{MJ} \).
