A graph is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The diagram includes phase regions with labeled boundaries for "Sublimation," "Solid," and "Liquid." The curve transitions between these regions, indicating phase changes. The axes are labeled as \( p \) (pressure) and \( T \) (temperature), but no numerical values are provided on the axes.
