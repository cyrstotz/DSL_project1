The diagram shows a qualitative \( T \)-\( s \) diagram for the jet engine process. The temperature \( T \) is plotted on the vertical axis, and the entropy \( s \) is plotted on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled isobars for pressures \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_1 = p_4 = p_5 \), and \( p_6 = p_0 \). The states are connected by curves representing the thermodynamic processes:  
- State 1 to 2: Compression  
- State 2 to 3: Isobaric combustion  
- State 3 to 4: Expansion in the turbine  
- State 4 to 5: Mixing  
- State 5 to 6: Expansion in the nozzle
