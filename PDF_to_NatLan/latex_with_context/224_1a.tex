The problem begins with the calculation of heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \). The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
Q = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} \cdot \left( h_{\text{out}}^{w} - h_{\text{in}}^{w} \right) + \dot{Q}_R
\]  
where:  
- \( h_{\text{in}}^{w}(70^\circ\text{C}) = 292.04 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) (from water tables A2)  
- \( h_{\text{out}}^{w}(100^\circ\text{C}) = 419.04 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) (from water tables A2)  

The heat flow removed by the coolant is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 62.482 \, \text{kW}
\]
