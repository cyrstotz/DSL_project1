The internal energy \( u_2 \) is equal to \( u_1 \) because the temperature remains constant.  

The ice mass fraction in state 1 is given as:  
\[
x_{\text{ice},1} = \frac{m_{\text{ice}}}{m_{\text{EW}}} = 0.6
\]  

The internal energy \( u_2 \) is calculated using the mixture formula:  
\[
u_2 = u_f + x (u_g - u_f)
\]  

The ice mass in state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
m_{\text{ice},1} = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 \, \text{kg} = 0.06 \, \text{kg}
\]
