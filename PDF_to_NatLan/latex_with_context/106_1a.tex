The problem involves water as the reactor fluid. The reactor operates with the following conditions:  

A table is provided with the following data:  
- **State 1:**  
  - Pressure (\( p \)): Not specified  
  - Temperature (\( T \)): \( 70^\circ\text{C} \)  
  - Steam quality (\( x \)): \( x = 1 \)  

- **State 2:**  
  - Pressure (\( p \)): Not specified  
  - Temperature (\( T \)): \( 100^\circ\text{C} \)  
  - Steam quality (\( x \)): \( x = 1 \)  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}} \right) + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{Q}_{\text{out}}
\]  
Rearranging for the heat flow removed by the coolant:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} \left( h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}} \right) + \dot{Q}_R
\]  

The enthalpy values for the saturated liquid at the given temperatures are:  
\[
h_{\text{in}}(70^\circ\text{C}, x = 1) = 2626.8 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  
\[
h_{\text{out}}(100^\circ\text{C}, x = 1) = 2676.1 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]  

Using water tables (referenced as A-2), the heat flow removed is calculated as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 85.2 \, \text{kW}
\]  

This value is positive according to the chosen convention, indicating heat is removed from the system.
