The first diagram is a qualitative representation of the jet engine process on a temperature-entropy (\( T \)-\( S \)) diagram. It includes labeled isobars and key states:  
- State 1: Initial compression.  
- State 2: Adiabatic compression.  
- State 3: Isobaric heat addition.  
- State 4: Expansion in the turbine.  
- State 5: Mixing chamber.  
- State 6: Nozzle exit.  

The axes are labeled as follows:  
- \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin) on the vertical axis.  
- \( S \) (entropy in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \)) on the horizontal axis.
