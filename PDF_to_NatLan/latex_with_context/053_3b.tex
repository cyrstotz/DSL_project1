The pressure in state 2 remains unchanged:  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.40094 \, \text{bar}
\]  

It is stated that nothing has changed in terms of pressure or mass. The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to \( T_{\text{EW},2} \), indicating equilibrium:  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} \rightarrow \text{Equilibrium}
\]  

The mass \( m_{g,2} \) remains the same as \( m_{g,1} \).
