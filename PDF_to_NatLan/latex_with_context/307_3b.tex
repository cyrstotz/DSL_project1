The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \) because the weight above always remains constant.  
The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is calculated as:  
\[
p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is \( 0^\circ\text{C} \) because it is in equilibrium with the ice-water liquid-solid mixture.
