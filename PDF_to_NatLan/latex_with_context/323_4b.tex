The first law of thermodynamics is applied to the system. The equation is written as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m}_2 \left( h_2 - h_3 \right) + \dot{Q}_K - \dot{W}_K
\]  
where \( S_2 = S_3 \).  

Additional notes:  
- \( h_2 = h_{fg} \) because \( x = 1 \).  
- A temperature range is provided but partially crossed out:  
  \[
  T_1 = 288.15 \, \text{K}, \, T_2 = 271.45 \, \text{K}.
  \]  

No further explanation is provided for the calculations.

Using the first law of thermodynamics for heat transfer:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_e
\]  
Rewritten as:  
\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_e
\]  
The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_e \) is expressed as:  
\[
\dot{Q}_e = \dot{m} \frac{h_2 - h_1}{h_2 + h_1}
\]
