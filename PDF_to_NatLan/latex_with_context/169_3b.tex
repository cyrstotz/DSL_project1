The volume \( V_{g,2} \) is equal to \( V_{g,1} \):  
\[
V_{g,2} = V_{g,1}
\]  
The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p_{g,2} = \frac{V_{g,1} \cdot m \cdot R \cdot T_{g,2}}{V_{g,1}}
\]  
It is noted that:  
\[
p_{\text{amb}} = p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar}
\]
