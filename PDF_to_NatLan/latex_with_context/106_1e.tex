The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) of the reactor contents from state 1 to state 2 is calculated using the following formula:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = 64.7855 \, \frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]  

Additional calculations:  
- The mass at state 1 is \( m_1 = 5755 \, \text{kg} \).  
- The mass at state 2 is \( m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12} = 9355 \, \text{kg} \).  

The specific entropy at state 2 is:  
\[
s_2 [70^\circ\text{C}, x = 1] = 7.7553 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}}
\]  

The specific entropy at state 1 is calculated as:  
\[
s_1 [100^\circ\text{C}, x = 0.005] = s_f + x (s_g - s_f)
\]  
Substituting values:  
\[
s_1 = 1.37 + 14 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}}
\]
