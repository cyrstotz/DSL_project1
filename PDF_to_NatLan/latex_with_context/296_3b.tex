The gas pressure \( p_{g,2} \) in state 2 is equal to \( p_{g,1} \) because the piston remains stationary.  
\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1}
\]  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to \( T_{\text{EW},2} \) because thermal equilibrium is reached.  
\[
T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2}
\]  

Thermodynamic equilibrium is established, and not all ice has melted.
