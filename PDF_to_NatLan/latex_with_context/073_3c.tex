The first law of thermodynamics is applied to the gas system:  
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{m}_i \left( h_i + \frac{pe_i}{\rho} + \frac{ke_i}{\rho} \right) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
\]  

For this case, the energy change is simplified to:  
\[
\Delta U = Q_{12}
\]  
\[
m_{\text{gas}} \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12}
\]  

The heat transferred from the gas is calculated using the equation for a perfect gas:  
\[
Q_{12} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]  

Substituting the given values:  
\[
Q_{12} = 3.6 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \cdot (273.15 \, \text{K} - 773.15 \, \text{K})
\]  
\[
= -1.139 \, \text{kJ} = -1139.4 \, \text{J}
\]  

Thus, \( 1139.4 \, \text{J} \) of heat is transferred.
