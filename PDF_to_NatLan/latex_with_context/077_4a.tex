The diagram is a pressure-temperature (\(p\)-\(T\)) plot illustrating the freeze-drying process. It includes the phase regions for solid, liquid, and gas, with the triple point marked.  
- The pressure axis (\(p\)) is labeled, with a point at 5 mbar, which is below the triple point pressure.  
- The temperature axis (\(T\)) is labeled in degrees Celsius (\(^\circ\text{C}\)).  
- The process steps are indicated:  
  1. Isobaric freezing: Pressure remains constant, temperature decreases, and the state transitions to solid.  
  2. Isothermal sublimation: Pressure decreases, temperature remains constant, and the state transitions to gas.
