The entropy change is calculated as follows:  
\[
\Delta S_{12} = S_2 - S_1
\]  

At state 2, the total mass is:  
\[
m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m = 5755 + 363 = 6118 \, \text{kg}
\]  

The specific entropy at state 2 is determined using \( T = 70^\circ\text{C} \) and \( x = 1 \):  
\[
s_2(T=70^\circ\text{C}, x=1) = 0.954 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}}
\]  

At state 1, the specific entropy is given for \( T = 100^\circ\text{C} \) and \( x = 0.005 \):  
\[
s_1(T=100^\circ\text{C}, x=0.005)
\]  

The entropy change is calculated using these values.
