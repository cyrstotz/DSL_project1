The molar mass of the gas is \( M = 50 \, \text{kg/kmol} \), and the specific heat capacity at constant volume is \( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \). The initial temperature of the gas is \( T_{g,1} = 500^\circ\text{C} \), and the initial volume is \( V_{g,1} = 5.15 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3 \).  

The gas pressure is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\[
p V = n R T
\]  
where \( R = \frac{R_u}{M} = 166.29 \, \text{J/(kg·K)} \).  

The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is given by:  
\[
p_{g,1} = p_{\text{amb}} + \left( m_K + m_{\text{EW}} \right) g \frac{1}{A}
\]  
where \( A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \).  

The mass of the gas is calculated as:  
\[
m_g = \frac{p_{\text{amb}} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} = 0.0056 \, \text{kg} = 5.6 \, \text{g}
\]
