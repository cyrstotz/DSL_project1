\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as \( S \) and the y-axis is labeled as \( T \). The graph consists of six points labeled from 1 to 6, connected by lines to form a closed loop. The points are connected in the following order: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6, and 6 back to 1. 

There are several dashed lines running horizontally across the graph, indicating constant pressure lines. These lines are labeled as \( P_0 \), \( P_3 \), \( P_4 \), \( P_5 \), \( P_1 \), and \( P_2 \) from bottom to top. The point 3 is labeled with the coordinates "22-934-558".

\[
Q = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} \right] - W_{\text{t,rev}}
\]

\[
h_e - h_a = (c_p^0) (T_5 - T_6) = 104.448 \left( \frac{kJ}{kg} \right)
\]

\[
T_c = \left( \frac{P_0}{P_5} \right)^{\frac{k-1}{k}} T_5 = 328.0746969 \, K
\]

\[
k = 1.4
\]

\[
\dot{W}_{\text{t}} + W_{\text{rev}} = \dot{m} R \frac{(T_5 - T_6)}{1 - n} = 74.608 \left( \frac{kJ}{kg} \right)
\]

\[
R = c_p - c_v = 0.297987541
\]

\[
c_v = \frac{c_p}{k} = 0.714879 \left( \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right)
\]

\[
Q = h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2}{2} - \frac{w_a^2}{2} - W_{\text{rev}}
\]

\[
w_a = \sqrt{(h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e}{2} - W_{\text{rev}}) \cdot 2} = 220.13359 \left( \frac{m}{s} \right)
\]
