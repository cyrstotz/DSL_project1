\subsection*{a)}

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph:] The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( p[\text{bar}] \) and the x-axis labeled as \( T[\degree C] \). There are two lines labeled (i) and (ii). Line (i) starts from the origin and goes upwards with a positive slope. Line (ii) starts from the same point as line (i) but has a steeper slope. The region between the two lines is labeled as "test". The area below line (i) is labeled as "fl√ºssig" and the area above line (ii) is labeled as "gas".
\end{description}

\[
T_1 = -10\degree C \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_2 = T_2 = -40\degree C

\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{h_e - h_a}

\[
h_e = h_g (-40\degree C) - 246.9 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}

\subsection*{c)}

\[
S_1 = S_4 = S_f (8 \text{bar}) = 0.3 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}} \quad p_3 = p_4
\]

\[
h_3 = S_4 - S_f (-40\degree C)
\]

\[
\frac{S_4 - S_f (-40\degree C)}{S_g (-40\degree C) - S_f (-40\degree C)} = 0.23
