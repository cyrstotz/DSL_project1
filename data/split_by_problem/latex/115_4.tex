\section*{Problem 1}

\subsection*{a)}

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as $p$ and the horizontal axis labeled as $T$. There is a curve starting from the origin and rising upwards to the right, labeled as "Sättigungsdamp". A vertical line is drawn from a point on the curve upwards, labeled as "isotherm". A horizontal line is drawn from the same point to the right, labeled as "isobar". Another horizontal line is drawn from a point on the curve to the left, labeled as "isotherm". The intersection of the isotherm and isobar lines is marked with a dot.

\subsection*{c)}

\begin{description}
    \item[Equation:] 
    \[
    h_a = h_e - \frac{1}{\dot{m}} \left| \dot{Q_k} \right|
    \]
    \[
    h_e - h_u = \frac{1}{\dot{m}} \left| \dot{Q_k} \right|
    \]
    \[
    x = \frac{h_e - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
    \]
