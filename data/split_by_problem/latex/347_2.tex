\subsection*{a)}

\[
\eta = \frac{P}{P_0}
\]

\[
P_0 = P_4
\]

\[
P_4 = P_1
\]

\[
P_0 = P_1
\]

\subsection*{Graph Description}

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled $\eta$ and the horizontal axis labeled $s \left( \frac{t}{\sqrt{t}} \right)$. 

- The vertical axis $\eta$ has the following points marked:
  - At the bottom, the point is labeled as 0.
  - A point higher up is labeled as 1.
  - Another point higher up is labeled as 2.
  - The topmost point is labeled as 3.

- The horizontal axis $s \left( \frac{t}{\sqrt{t}} \right)$ has the following points marked:
  - The point at the far right is labeled as 80.

There are three curves drawn on the graph:
- The first curve starts at the origin (0,0), passes through a point labeled 6, and ends at a point labeled 1. This curve is labeled $\eta < 1$.
- The second curve starts at the origin (0,0), passes through a point labeled 4, and ends at a point labeled 2.
- The third curve starts at the origin (0,0), passes through a point labeled 2, and ends at a point labeled 3.

There are dashed lines extending from the end points of the curves towards the right.
