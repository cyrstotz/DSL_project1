\subsection*{b)}

\[
T_i = 253.15\,K
\]

\subsection*{c)}

The graph is a pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The $y$-axis is labeled $p$ (bar) and the $x$-axis is labeled $T$ (Â°C). The graph shows three distinct regions labeled "solid", "liquid", and "gas". 

- The "solid" region is on the left side of the graph.
- The "liquid" region is in the middle.
- The "gas" region is on the right side.

There is a curve separating the "solid" and "liquid" regions, and another curve separating the "liquid" and "gas" regions. 

An isobar is drawn horizontally across the "liquid" region, labeled as "isobar". 

\subsection*{d)}

\[
\epsilon_K = \frac{\dot{Q}_{zu}}{\dot{W}_{+}} = \frac{|\dot{Q}_{zu}|}{|\dot{Q}_{ab}| - |\dot{Q}_{zu}|}
\]
