4. a) TPP bei 6 bar \& 0Â°C

\textbf{Graph Description:} 
The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( P \) in units of \([ \text{bar} ]\) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T \) in units of \([ \text{K} ]\). The plot shows a single smooth curve that starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls back down symmetrically.

b)

c) Drossel \(\Rightarrow\) isenthalp

\[
h_2 = h_1, \quad h_1 = h_f = 93.42 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

\[
x_1 = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} \Rightarrow x_1 = 0
\]
