\subsection*{a) PPA}

\subsection*{b) TBA A-10}

\subsubsection*{i)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a graph with the y-axis labeled as $T$ and the x-axis labeled as $P \, [\text{bar}]$.
    \item The y-axis has three points labeled $T_2$, $T_a$, and $T_{KD}$ from bottom to top.
    \item There are three curves on the graph:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The first curve starts from the bottom left and curves upwards to the right, passing through point $a$.
            \item The second curve starts from the bottom left and curves upwards to the right, passing through point $b$.
            \item The third curve starts from the bottom left and curves upwards to the right, passing through point $c$.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Points $a$, $b$, and $c$ are marked on the graph.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{ii)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a graph with the y-axis labeled as $P \, [\text{bar}]$ and the x-axis labeled as $T \, [K]$.
    \item There are two curves on the graph:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The first curve starts from the bottom left and curves upwards to the right, passing through point $1$.
            \item The second curve starts from the bottom left and curves upwards to the right, passing through point $2$.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Points $1$, $2$, $A$, and $B$ are marked on the graph.
    \item There are arrows indicating isobaric processes between points $1$ and $A$, and between points $2$ and $B$.
\end{itemize}

\[
2 (h_2 - h_5) = w_5^2 - w_2^2 \implies w_5^2 = w_2^2 - 2 (h_2 - h_5)

\[
(h_2 - h_5) = c_p (T_5 - T_2) = 1.006 (311.4 - 293.9) = -118.25
