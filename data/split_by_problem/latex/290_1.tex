\section*{Graph Description}

The graph is a T-s diagram with the temperature $T$ on the vertical axis and the entropy $s$ on the horizontal axis. The axes are labeled as follows:
- The vertical axis is labeled $T \quad [K]$.
- The horizontal axis is labeled $s \quad [kJ/kg \cdot K]$.

The graph contains several curves and points:
- There is a black curve starting from the origin (0,0) and rising steeply, then leveling off and fluctuating before rising again.
- Points are marked along the curves with numbers 0 through 6.
- Points 0, 1, and 2 are connected by a black curve.
- Points 2, 3, and 4 are connected by a magenta curve.
- Points 4, 5, and 6 are connected by another magenta curve.
- Points 3 and 5 are connected by a vertical magenta line.
- Points 0, 6, and 4 are connected by a black curve.
- The points are labeled as follows:
  - Point 0 is at the origin.
  - Point 1 is on the initial black curve.
  - Point 2 is on the initial black curve.
  - Point 3 is on the magenta curve.
  - Point 4 is on the magenta curve.
  - Point 5 is on the magenta curve.
  - Point 6 is on the black curve.

There is a note on the right side of the graph that says "blaue Kurve nicht beachten!" which means "ignore the blue curve!"
