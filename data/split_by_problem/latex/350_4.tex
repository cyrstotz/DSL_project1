\subsection*{a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a graph with the vertical axis labeled as $p$ (bar) and the horizontal axis labeled as $T$ (°C).
    \item The graph shows a curve that starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls again.
    \item There is a point labeled "ND" on the rising part of the curve.
    \item An arrow points to the curve with the text "p \& T gehören zusammen".
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{b)}

\[
T_{\text{verdampfen}} = T_1 - 6K

\[
\text{adiabat, reversibel} = \text{isentrop} : S_3 = S_1
\]

\subsection*{c)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a PVT diagram with the vertical axis labeled as $p$, the horizontal axis labeled as $V$, and the depth axis labeled as $T$.
    \item The diagram shows a 3D box-like shape.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{e)}
