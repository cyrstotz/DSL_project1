\section*{Problem 9a}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a pressure-volume diagram with the x-axis labeled \( V [L] \) and the y-axis labeled \( p [\text{bar}] \).
    \item The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    \item Point 1 is at the bottom left, labeled "Flüssig".
    \item Point 2 is at the bottom right, labeled "Nassdampf".
    \item Point 3 is at the top right, labeled "trocken".
    \item Point 4 is at the top left, labeled "überhitzter Dampf".
    \item The curve from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isotherm".
    \item The curve from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isotherm".
    \item The curve from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "isotherm".
    \item The curve from point 4 to point 1 is labeled "isotherm".
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem a b}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A circular diagram with three arrows pointing outward from the center, labeled \( W_i \).
    \item The arrows are labeled 1, 2, and 3.
    \item \( x_2 = 1 \)
    \item \( p_3 = 8 \text{bar} \)
    \item \( \sigma = \frac{m}{n_{34}u} (e_{L2} - e_{L3}) - W_i \)
\end{itemize}

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_i \dot{m}_i (h_i + \frac{c^2}{2} + gz)_{in} - \sum_o \dot{m}_o (h_o + \frac{c^2}{2} + gz)_{out} + \sum Q_i(t) - \sum W_i(t)
\]

\section*{Problem c}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A diagram with a horizontal line and a vertical line intersecting at point 1.
    \item The horizontal line is labeled \( x_{11} = 0 \).
    \item \( p_{q} = 8 \text{bar} \)
    \item \( A_q = \frac{h_f}{h_g - h_f} = 93.42 \frac{1}{kg} \)
    \item \( h_q = 93.42 \frac{1}{kg} \)
\end{itemize}

\[
x_q = \frac{h_q - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
\]

\section*{Problem d1}
\[
E_1 = \frac{1}{\dot{Q}_{zu1}} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{zu1}}{1/\dot{Q}_{zu1} - 1/\dot{Q}_{zu1}}
