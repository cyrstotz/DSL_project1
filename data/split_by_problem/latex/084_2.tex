\subsection*{a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Graph: T-S Diagram
    \item The x-axis is labeled as $s$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T$.
    \item There is a curve starting from point 0 to point 1, labeled as "isentrop, $T_1$".
    \item From point 1 to point 2, the curve is labeled as "mk = isentrop, $T_2$".
    \item From point 2 to point 3, the curve is labeled as "ink = isobar $T_3$".
    \item From point 3 to point 4, the curve is labeled as "mk = irreversible Turbine".
    \item From point 4 to point 5, the curve is labeled as "mk + mk = isobar".
    \item From point 5 to point 6, the curve is labeled as "isotherm".
    \item The curve from point 0 to point 1 is marked as "isentrop".
    \item The curve from point 1 to point 2 is marked as "isentrop".
    \item The curve from point 2 to point 3 is marked as "isobar".
    \item The curve from point 3 to point 4 is marked as "irreversible Turbine".
    \item The curve from point 4 to point 5 is marked as "isobar".
    \item The curve from point 5 to point 6 is marked as "isotherm".
    \item There is a note: "Sorry, Deutsch-Salat im Kopf, ich meine isentrop".

\subsection*{b) $w_0, T_0$ bestimmen:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Luft = ideales Gas
    \item $p^0 \cdot v^0 = R \cdot T_0$
    \item $R_{\text{Luft}} = \frac{8,314 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kmol} \cdot \text{K}}}{28,87 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{kmol}}} = 287 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}}$
    \item $G \rightarrow 6$ ist isentrop
    \item $s_6 = s_5$
    \item $T_5 = 80 \, \text{Â°C}, \, p = 0,5 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{Pa}, \, 431,9 \, \text{K} = \text{Tab-A-22}$
