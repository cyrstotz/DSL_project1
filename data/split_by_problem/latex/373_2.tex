\subsection*{a) T-s-Diagramm}

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a T-s diagram with the y-axis labeled as \( T \) and the x-axis labeled as \( s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \). There are three isotherms labeled \( T_B \), \( T_S \), and \( T_0 \) from top to bottom. The graph contains five points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The points are connected as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 is at the bottom left.
        \item Point 1 is connected vertically to Point 2.
        \item Point 2 is connected horizontally to Point 3.
        \item Point 3 is connected vertically to Point 4.
        \item Point 4 is connected horizontally to Point 5.
    \end{itemize}
    There is a dashed vertical line extending upwards from Point 4.
