\subsection*{a)}
\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \) [bar] and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \) [K]. There are two curves that intersect, forming a V-shape. The left curve starts from the top left and goes downwards, while the right curve starts from the top right and goes downwards. There is a horizontal line connecting two points on the curves, labeled as 2 and 7. The point 2 is on the left curve, and the point 7 is on the right curve. The horizontal line is labeled \( T_{\text{invert}} \). There is a wavy line extending from point 7 to the right, indicating some form of oscillation or fluctuation.

\begin{align*}
    T_1 &= -70^\circ C \\
    T_2 &= T_1 - 6K = -78^\circ C \\
    p_3 &= 8 \text{ bar} \\
    S_3 &= S_2 \rightarrow
