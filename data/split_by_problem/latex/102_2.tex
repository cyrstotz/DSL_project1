        \item[Graph Description:] 
        The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[ K \right]$. There are three curves labeled as "isotherm" and "isentrope". The first curve starts from point 1, goes through point 2, and ends at point 3. The second curve starts from point 4 and ends at point 3. The third curve starts from point 0 and ends at point 4. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked on the graph.
