\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a graph with the y-axis labeled as $T \, [K]$ and the x-axis labeled as $s \, \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$.
    \item The graph contains a closed loop with six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    \item The path from 0 to 1 is curved upwards.
    \item The path from 1 to 2 is vertical and labeled as "isotrop".
    \item The path from 2 to 3 is curved upwards and labeled as "isobar".
    \item The path from 3 to 4 is vertical and labeled as "isotrop".
    \item The path from 4 to 5 is horizontal.
    \item The path from 5 to 0 is curved downwards and labeled as "isobar".

\[
\frac{w_{\delta}^2}{2} = c_p (T_s - T_{\delta}) + \frac{w_s^2}{2} = 128.65 \, \frac{kJ}{kg}
