\textbf{Verbal Description of the Graph:}

The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( P \) [bar] and the x-axis labeled as \( T \) [K]. The graph shows a curve that starts from the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls again. The curve is divided into three regions: "sol." (solid) on the left, "flu." (fluid) in the middle, and "gas" on the right. There are three points marked on the curve: point 1 at the bottom right, point 2 at the bottom left, and point 3 at the peak. A vertical dashed line extends from point 3 upwards. A horizontal arrow points from point 2 to point 1.

\[
\dot{m}_R = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{w_{23}^{rev}}
\]

\[
w_{23}^{rev} = - \left( \int_{v_A}^{v_2} p \, dv \right)
\]

4c) 
\[
s_u = s_\lambda
\]

\[
s_u (2 \text{bar})_g = 0.9066 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}}
\]

\[
x_\lambda = \frac{s_u - s_f \, (\text{2 bar})}{s_g - s_f}
