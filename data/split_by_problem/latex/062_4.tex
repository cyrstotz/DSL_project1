\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( P(v) \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( v \left( \frac{m^3}{kg} \right) \). The graph shows two curves. The first curve starts at the origin, rises steeply, reaches a peak, and then gradually decreases. The second curve starts at the origin, rises more gradually, intersects the first curve at its peak, and then continues to rise.

\begin{description}
    \item[Diagram Description:] The diagram shows a triangular shape with a horizontal base. The left vertex of the triangle is labeled \( w \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \). There is an arrow pointing to the right from this vertex. The right vertex of the triangle is labeled \( R \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \). There is an arrow pointing to the left from this vertex.
