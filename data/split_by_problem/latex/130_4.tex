\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( p \) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T \) (k). There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The points 1 and 2 are connected by a horizontal line labeled "Isobar". The points 3 and 4 are also connected by a horizontal line labeled "Isobar". There is a curved line passing through points 1, 4, 3, and 2, forming a loop. The region inside the loop is labeled "Isobar".

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 2:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( p \) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T \). There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The points 1 and 2 are connected by a horizontal line labeled "fl체ssigkeit". The points 3 and 4 are connected by a horizontal line labeled "ges채ttigter dampf". There is a curved line passing through points 1, 4, 3, and 2, forming a loop. The region inside the loop is labeled "fl체ssigkeit" and "ges채ttigter dampf".
