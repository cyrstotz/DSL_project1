\section*{Aufgabe 2}

\subsection*{a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled \( S \) and the y-axis labeled \( T(K) \).
    \item The graph starts at point 1, moves vertically up to point 2, then curves downwards to point 3, and finally moves horizontally to point 4.
    \item The region between points 1 and 2 is shaded.
    \item The curve from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "Isotherm".
    \item The horizontal line from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "Isochore".
    \item There is a small curve from point 4 to point 5, and then a horizontal line from point 5 to point 6.
    \item The x-axis has an arrow pointing to the right, and the y-axis has an arrow pointing upwards.
    \item There is a label "WD" near the x-axis and a label "kJ/K" near the y-axis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{b)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( 5 \rightarrow 6 \) adiabatic \& reversible \(\Rightarrow\) isentropic
\end{itemize}
