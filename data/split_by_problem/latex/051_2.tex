\section*{2:}

\subsection*{a)}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( S \, [\frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}] \) and the y-axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \). There are three curves on the graph, each representing an isobaric process. The first curve is labeled "1", the second curve is labeled "2", and the third curve is labeled "3". The point "1" is located on the first curve, the point "2" is located on the second curve, and the point "3" is located on the third curve. The points are connected by lines indicating the process path. The line connecting points "1" and "2" is nearly vertical, while the line connecting points "2" and "3" is inclined. The third curve is labeled "Isobar P".

\[
W_T = 22 \, \frac{kJ}{kg}

\[
P_s = 0.5 \, bar
\]

\[
T_s = 493.9 \, K

\[
\text{Reversible adiabatic} \Rightarrow \text{polytropic process}

\[
n = k = 1.4
\]

\[
c_p = 1.006 \, \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}
\]

\[
T_c = T_s \left( \frac{P_c}{P_s} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} = 328.075 \, K
\]

\[
0 = \dot{m} \left( h_s - h_c + \frac{w_s^2 - w_c^2}{2} \right) + \dot{m} \left( \frac{v_s^2 - v_c^2}{2} \right)
\]

\[
h_s - h_c = c_p (T_s - T_c) = 1.006 \cdot (493.9 - 328.075) \, K = 109.44 \, \frac{kJ}{kg}
\]

\[
h_c - \frac{w_s^2 - w_c^2}{2} = 109.44 \, \frac{kJ}{kg}
\]

\[
w_c = \sqrt{109.44 \, \frac{kJ}{kg} \cdot 2 + w_s^2} = \sqrt{220.92 \, \frac{m^2}{s^2}}
