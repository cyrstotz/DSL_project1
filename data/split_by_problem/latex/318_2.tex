\section*{2a}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as $S$ with units $\left[\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}}\right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T$ with units $[\text{K}]$.
    \item The graph consists of a curve that starts at point 1 on the y-axis, moves up to point 2, then to point 3, down to point 4, and finally up to point 5 on the y-axis.
    \item Points 1 and 5 are on the y-axis, with point 1 at the bottom and point 5 at the top.
    \item The curve between points 2 and 3 is labeled as "isobar (geht durch 3)" and the curve between points 4 and 5 is labeled as "isobar".
    \item The curve between points 3 and 4 is labeled as "isobar".
