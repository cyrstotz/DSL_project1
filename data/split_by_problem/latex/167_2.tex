2. a) \quad \tau (T)

\begin{description}
\item[Graph Description:] 
The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \(\tau (T)\) and the horizontal axis labeled \(s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]\). The graph consists of a piecewise linear and curved plot with the following points and segments:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Point 1 at the origin (0,0).
    \item A line segment from point 1 to point 2, which is slightly above and to the right of point 1.
    \item A line segment from point 2 to point 3, which is further above and to the right of point 2.
    \item A curved segment from point 3 to point 4, which is above and to the right of point 3.
    \item A line segment from point 4 to point 5, which is below and to the right of point 4.
    \item A line segment from point 5 to point 6, which is below and to the left of point 5.
    \item A line segment from point 6 back to point 2, closing the loop.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

b)
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} \left( h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} \right) \approx \dot{Q} - \dot{W}^2
\]

\[
\Rightarrow T_e = T_1 \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
\]

\[
p_1 = \frac{RT}{v}
\]
