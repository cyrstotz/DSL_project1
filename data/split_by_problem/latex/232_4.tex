\section*{Aufgabe 4}

\subsection*{a)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as $T[\text{K}]$ and the y-axis labeled as $p[\text{bar}]$.
    \item The graph shows a curve that starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls back down, forming a bell shape.
    \item Below the peak, there is a wavy line that oscillates horizontally.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{b)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ad. rev 2-3 $\Rightarrow$ isentrop $s_2 = s_3$
    \item 3-4 isobar
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{c)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as $T[\text{K}]$ and the y-axis labeled as $p[\text{bar}]$.
    \item The graph shows a rectangular cycle with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    \item Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is at the bottom right, point 3 is at the top right, and point 4 is at the top left.
    \item The cycle forms a rectangle with horizontal and vertical lines connecting the points.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{d)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_i = -10^\circ \text{C}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{e)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\epsilon_K = \frac{|Q_{zu}|}{|W|} = \frac{|Q_{ab}|}{|Q_{ab}| - |Q_{zu}|}$
    \item $x_1 = \frac{u_1 - u_{1g}}{u_{1g} - u_f}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{f)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item würde schneller abkühlen
\end{itemize}
