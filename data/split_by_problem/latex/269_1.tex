\section*{Problem 2}

\subsection*{a)}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $s \left[\frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}\right]$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T \left[K\right]$. There are two curves on the graph:

1. The first curve starts at point 5, goes upwards and to the right, and ends at point 6. This curve is labeled as $P_5 = P_6$.
2. The second curve starts at point 6, goes upwards and to the right, and ends at point 7. This curve is labeled as $P_7 = P_8$.

There are arrows indicating the direction of the process along the curves. The points are connected by vertical lines indicating constant pressure processes.

\subsection*{b)}

\[
Q = \dot{m} (h_5 - h_6) \cdot t - \dot{W}
\]

\[
T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{P_6}{P_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} = 328.07 K
\]

\[
\dot{W}_{t}^{rev} = \dot{m} (h_5 - h_6) = \dot{m} c_p (T_5 - T_6) = 104.45 kW
\]

\[
\dot{W}_{t}^{rev} = \int_{5}^{6} v dp + \left( \frac{\omega_6^2}{2} - \frac{\omega_5^2}{2} \right) \Rightarrow
\]

\[
\int_{5}^{6} v dp = -n \int_{5}^{6} v dv = -\frac{n}{1-n} R (T_6 - T_5) = -104.45 kW
\]

\[
\Rightarrow n = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = 1.4 \quad c_v = 0.7186 \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}
\]

\[
R = c_p - c_v = 0.287 \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}
\]

\section*{Problem c}

\begin{align*}
    \omega_0 &= 510 \frac{M}{S} \\
    T_0 &= 390 K
\end{align*}

\[
\Delta h = h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{1}{2} \omega_6^2 - \frac{1}{2} \omega_0^2 \Rightarrow \Delta h = 0
\]

\[
h_6 - h_0 = C_p (T_6 - T_0) = 372.22 \frac{kJ}{kg}
\]

\[
s_6 - s_0 = c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) = 5.867 \frac{kJ}{kgK}
\]
