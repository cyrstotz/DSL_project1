\textbf{Verbal Description of the Graph:}

The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as $p[\text{bar}]$ and the x-axis labeled as $T[^\circ C]$. There is a curve starting from the bottom left and rising to the right, labeled as "Trippel". There is a small inset graph within the main graph, located near the top right of the main graph. The inset graph has two axes: the horizontal axis is labeled "isotherm" and the vertical axis is labeled "isobar". The inset graph has two points labeled "1" and "2", connected by a line.

b) 2-3 Kompressor adiabant \quad \dot{Q}_k = 0

\begin{align*}
\text{1HS} \quad \frac{dE}{dt} &= \dot{m} \left[ h + \frac{k^2}{2} + \frac{p}{\rho} \right] + \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W}_u \\
0 &= \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_k \quad \dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{h_2 - h_3}
\end{align*}

\dot{m} =
