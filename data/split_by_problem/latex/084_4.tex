\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( p \) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T \). The graph starts at the origin and rises to a peak labeled as \( T_{max} \) (i). After reaching the peak, the graph descends and then rises again to a point labeled as (ii). The region under the initial rise is labeled as "Nassdampf". The graph then continues to the right, labeled as \( g.c.s \).

\subsection*{c)}

\[
x_1 = \frac{S - S_f}{S_g - S_f}
\]

\subsection*{d)}

\[
\varepsilon = \left| \dot{Q}_{zu} \right| = \frac{\left| \dot{Q}_{zu} \right|}{\left| \dot{Q}_{ab} \right| - \left| \dot{Q}_{zu} \right|}
\]
