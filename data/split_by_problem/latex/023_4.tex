\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \). The graph shows a curve that starts at the bottom left, oscillates up and down several times, and then curves downwards to the right.
    \item[Graph 2:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \). There are two lines: one labeled "Gas, fest" which is a straight line starting from the origin and going upwards to the right, and another line labeled "fl체ssig" which starts from a point on the first line and goes downwards to the right. There is a point labeled \( T \) on the first line, and a region labeled "fl체ssig" below the second line.

Q = \dot{m} \left[ h_1 - h_2 \right] + \dot{Q}_k
\]

\[
h_2 = h_f(-22) = 234.8 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

\section*{c)}

\[
h_1 = h_4
\]

\[
h_4 = h_f(8 \text{bar}) = 93.42 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

\[
x = \frac{h_3 - h_f}{h_g - h_f}
