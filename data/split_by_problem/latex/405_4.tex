a) 

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a phase diagram with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The graph consists of three main regions: liquid, gas, and a region labeled "Nass-Dampf" (wet steam). The liquid region is on the left side of the graph, the gas region is on the right side, and the "Nass-Dampf" region is in the middle, forming a dome shape. The boundaries between these regions are curved lines. The left boundary curves upwards from the origin, separating the liquid region from the "Nass-Dampf" region. The right boundary curves upwards from the origin, separating the gas region from the "Nass-Dampf" region. The top of the dome is labeled "kritischer Punkt" (critical point). The horizontal axis is labeled \( T \) and the vertical axis is labeled \( p \). The text "test" appears twice, once near the left boundary and once near the right boundary, but it is crossed out.
