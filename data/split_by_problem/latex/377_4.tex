\textbf{Description of the graph:}

The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( T \, [^\circ C] \) and the y-axis is labeled \( P \, [\text{bar}] \). The graph contains the following points and lines:

- Point 1 is at the intersection of the isobaric line at 1 bar and the adiabatic curve.
- Point 2 is on the isobaric line at 1 bar, to the right of point 1.
- Point 3 is on the isobaric line at 8 bar, below point 2.
- Point 4 is on the isobaric line at 8 bar, to the left of point 3.

The lines connecting these points are as follows:

- A horizontal line (isobar) connects points 1 and 2.
- A curved line (adiabatic) connects points 2 and 3.
- A horizontal line (isobar) connects points 3 and 4.
- A curved line (adiabatic) connects points 4 and 1.

The labels on the graph are:
- "isobare" on the horizontal lines.
- "adiabate" and "adiabate (reversibel)" on the curved lines.
