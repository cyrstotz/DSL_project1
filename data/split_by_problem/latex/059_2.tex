\subsection*{a)}

The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $S$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T$. The graph contains several curves and points:

- There are three isobaric lines labeled as "isobare 0,5 bar", "isobare 1 bar", and "isobare 0,1 bar".
- There is an isotherm line labeled as "isotherm".
- There is an isentropic line labeled as "isentrop".
- Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The temperature at point 0 is approximately $-30^\circ C$.
- The process from point 0 to 1 is labeled as "adiabate".
- The process from point 1 to 2 is labeled as "isotherm".
- The process from point 2 to 3 is labeled as "isobare".
- The process from point 3 to 4 is labeled as "isobare".
- The process from point 4 to 5 is labeled as "isotherm".
- The process from point 5 to 6 is labeled as "adiabate".

\[
e_{x,str} = \left( h - h_0 - T_0 (s - s_0) + \frac{ke}{2} + \frac{pe}{2} \right)
\]

\[
e_{x,str} = \left( h_0 - h_0 - T_0 (s_0 - s_0) + \frac{W}{2} + \frac{W}{2} \right)
\]

\subsection*{d)}

\[
0 = \sum \dot{E}_{x,str}(t) + \sum \dot{E}_{x,Q}(t) - \sum \dot{W}_n(t) - \dot{E}_{x,ver}(t)
\]

\[
\dot{E}_{x,ver} = \dot{E}_{x,str} + \dot{E}_{x,Q}(t) - \sum \dot{W}_n(t)
\]
