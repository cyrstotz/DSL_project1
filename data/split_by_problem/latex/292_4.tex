\subsection*{a)}

\textbf{Graph Description:}

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \) (bar) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \) (Â°C). There are several curves and lines drawn on the graph:

- A curve labeled "isobar 1" starting from the lower left and moving upwards to the right.
- Another curve labeled "isobar 2" starting from the lower left and moving upwards to the right, parallel to the first curve.
- A horizontal line labeled "150 bar" intersecting the second curve.
- A vertical line labeled "tripel" intersecting the horizontal line.
- A point labeled "5" at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines.

\subsection*{b)}

\[
\dot{m}_{R124a}
\]

\subsection*{c)}

\[
\lambda = \frac{\phi - \phi_{K}}{q_{g} - q_{f}} = 
\]

\subsection*{d)}

\[
\epsilon_{K} = \frac{|\dot{Q}_{zu}|}{(u_{k})} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{zu}}{\dot{Q}_{zu,ab} (|\dot{Q}_{zu}|)} = \frac{23 W}{\dot{Q}_{k} - \dot{Q}_{ab}} = \frac{23 W}{(u_{1} - u_{2} (h_{3} - h_{4}))}
\]
