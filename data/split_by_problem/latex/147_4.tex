\subsection*{a)}

$p \, [\text{bar}]$

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a pressure-volume diagram with the y-axis labeled as \( p \, [\text{bar}] \) and the x-axis labeled as \( V \, [\text{m}^3] \). The graph consists of a closed loop with four distinct points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The path follows these points in a cyclic manner.
    
    \item[Path Description:] 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Starting at point 1, the path moves upwards and to the right, reaching point 2.
        \item From point 2, the path continues to rise steeply, reaching a peak and then descending to point 3.
        \item At point 3, the path moves downwards and to the left, reaching point 4.
        \item Finally, from point 4, the path moves back to point 1, completing the cycle.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[Arrows and Directions:] 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are arrows indicating the direction of the path: from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, from 3 to 4, and from 4 back to 1.
        \item The arrow from 1 to 2 is pointing upwards and to the right.
        \item The arrow from 2 to 3 is pointing downwards and to the right.
        \item The arrow from 3 to 4 is pointing downwards and to the left.
        \item The arrow from 4 to 1 is pointing upwards and to the left.
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}
