\section*{Problem 4}

\subsection*{a)}

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $T$ and the y-axis labeled as $p$. There are two horizontal dashed lines, one at $p = 5 \text{mbar}$ and another at $p = 0.9 \text{mbar}$. There are two points labeled (i) and (ii) on the graph. Point (i) is located at a higher temperature and pressure, while point (ii) is at a lower temperature and pressure. The graph shows a series of curves connecting these points, indicating some thermodynamic process.
    \item[Graph 2:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $T$ and the y-axis labeled as $p$. There is a single line starting from the origin and moving upwards to the right, indicating a linear relationship. There are two points labeled (i) and (ii) on the line, with point (i) at a higher temperature and pressure, and point (ii) at a lower temperature and pressure.

\subsection*{b)}

\[
-\dot{W}_K = \dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right]
\]

\[
h_2^{A=11} = h_g \left( 2 \text{bar} \right) = 249.3 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

\[
h_3^{A=11} = h_f \left( h_g \left( 8 \text{bar} \right) \right) = 264.15 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

\[
\dot{m} = \frac{-\dot{W}_K}{249.3 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} - 264.15 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}} = 1.223 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}}
