\section*{Problem 4.c}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( P \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \).
    \item The graph starts at the origin and shows a curve that starts with a steep slope and gradually flattens out as it moves to the right.
    \item There is a point marked on the curve, and this point is labeled as "kritisch".
\end{itemize}

4. a)

\[
\text{(crossed out text)}
\]

b)

\[
0 = \dot{m}_a (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_{\text{in}} \quad \left| \quad T_2 = T_1 \bar{6} K, \quad T_1 = T_5 + 10 K \right.
\]

\[
T_5 \left( \text{crossed out text} \right) = -25^\circ C + 5 = -20^\circ C
\]

\[
h_2 (-20^\circ C, x_2 = 1) = 24.26 \frac{kJ}{kg} \quad (\tau A - 10)
\]

\[
h_3 = 33 - 42 \frac{kJ}{kg} \quad (\tau A - 11)
\]

\[
\dot{r} x = \frac{\dot{W}_{\text{in}}}{h_2 - h_3}
\]
