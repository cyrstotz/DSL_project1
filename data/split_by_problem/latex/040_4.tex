\subsection*{9a}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a graph with the y-axis labeled \( p \, [\text{bar}] \) and the x-axis labeled \( T \, [K] \).
    \item The graph contains four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    \item Point 1 is at the intersection of the x-axis and a horizontal line extending from point 2.
    \item Point 2 is to the right of point 1 on the x-axis.
    \item Point 3 is above point 2 on a vertical line.
    \item Point 4 is to the left of point 3 on a horizontal line.
    \item Arrows indicate the direction of the process: from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to 1.
    \item The process from 1 to 2 is labeled as "isentrop".
    \item The process from 2 to 3 is labeled as "isentrop".
    \item The process from 3 to 4 is labeled as "isobar".
    \item The process from 4 to 1 is labeled as "Drucklerringerig".

\[
Q = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_k
\]

\[
h_2: \quad \text{Verdampfer} = T_i, \quad \dot{Q}_k = -6K
\]

\[
h_1 = hf(-6K), \quad h_2 = hgl(-6K)
\]

\subsection*{9c}

\[
x_1 = \frac{s - sf}{sg - sf}
\]
