a. 

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\text{Graph description:} \\
\text{The graph has a horizontal axis labeled } T \text{ and a vertical axis labeled } P. \\
\text{There are three curves on the graph. The first curve starts at the origin and rises steeply, labeled } 1. \\
\text{The second curve starts at the same point as the first but rises less steeply, labeled } 2. \\
\text{The third curve starts at the same point as the first two but rises even less steeply, labeled } 3. \\
\text{There are three points marked on the graph: } P_1, P_2, \text{ and } P_3. \\
\text{Point } P_1 \text{ is on the first curve, point } P_2 \text{ is on the second curve, and point } P_3 \text{ is on the third curve.} \\
\text{There are arrows pointing from } P_1 \text{ to } P_2 \text{ and from } P_2 \text{ to } P_3.} \\
\text{The points are connected by a line that goes up and to the right.} \\
\end{array}
\]

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\text{* Zustand 2: nasser Dampf} \\
\text{Zustand 4: reiner Dampf} \\
P_1 = P_2 \\
P_3 = P_4 = 8 \text{ bar}
\end{array}
\]

b. 

\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K
\]

\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3} \Rightarrow \text{Interpolation}
\]

\[
h_2 = 261.43 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

c. 

\[
h_4 = h_4 \Rightarrow T_x = T_u
\]

\[
h_4 = 721.11 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

d. 

\[
\epsilon = \frac{\dot{Q}_N}{\dot{W}_K}
\]
