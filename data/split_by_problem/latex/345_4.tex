    \begin{description}
        \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($P$-$T$) diagram. It consists of three curves and three points labeled 1, 2, and 3. The first curve is a vertical line starting from point 1 and moving upwards to point 2. The second curve is a horizontal line starting from point 2 and moving leftwards to point 3. The third curve is a diagonal line starting from point 3 and moving upwards to the right. The x-axis is labeled with a right arrow and the letter $T$ indicating temperature. The y-axis is labeled with a top arrow and the letter $P$ indicating pressure.

    \[
    \dot{W}_K = \dot{m}_{KN} (h_2 - h_3)
    \]
    \[
    s_2 = s_3
    \]
    \[
    p_i = 1 \text{mbar}, \quad T_i = -10^\circ C
    \]
    \[
    T_2 = -22^\circ C
    \]
    \[
    h_2 = 234.08 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}, \quad s_2 = 0.935 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgK}} \quad \text{TAB A-10}
    \]
    \[
    h_3 = 267.75 + (273.66 - 267.75) = 272.95 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
    \]
    \[
    s_2 = 0.2066 \quad 0.9379 - 0.2066 \quad \text{TAB A-12}
    \]
    \[
    \dot{m}_{KN} = 0.37 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{h}}
    \]
    
    \item[(c)] 
    \begin{description}
        \item[Table Description:] The table has five columns labeled $P$, $T$, $x$, and $\dot{W}$. The rows are labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The first row has the values $1$, $T_i = 0K$, $1$, and $25W$. The second row has the values $2$, $8$, and $0$. The third row has the values $3$, $11$, and $0$. The fourth row has the values $4$, $8$, and $0$. The first column has the labels "isob", "isent", "isob", and "adiab" next to the row numbers.
