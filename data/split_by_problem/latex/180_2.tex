    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $S$ and the y-axis is labeled $T(K)$. There are three curves and several points labeled on the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A curve starting from the origin and moving upwards to the right, labeled with points 1 and 2.
        \item Another curve starting from point 2 and moving upwards to the right, labeled with points 3 and $P_3$.
        \item A third curve starting from point $P_3$ and moving downwards to the right, labeled with points 4 and 5.
        \item A line labeled $P$ intersects the curves at points 2 and 4.
    \end{itemize}
