Two graphs are drawn side by side. The left graph has the y-axis labeled as P in kilopascals and the x-axis labeled as T in degrees Celsius. The left graph shows three lines intersecting at a point labeled "Triple":
- A line labeled "gaseous" sloping downwards from left to right.
- A line labeled "liquid" sloping upwards from left to right.
- A line labeled "solid" sloping downwards from left to right, intersecting the "liquid" line.

There are four points labeled with numbers:
- Point 1 is on the "solid" line.
- Point 2 is on the "liquid" line.
- Point 3 is on the "gaseous" line.
- Point 4 is at the intersection of the three lines (Triple).

The right graph has the y-axis labeled as P in kilopascals and the x-axis labeled as T in degrees Celsius. The right graph shows two curves:
- A curve labeled "liquid" sloping upwards from left to right.
- A curve labeled "gaseous" sloping upwards from left to right, intersecting the "liquid" curve.

There are three points labeled with numbers:
- Point 1 is on the "solid" line.
- Point 2 is on the "liquid" line.
- Point 3 is on the "gaseous" line.
