The change in mass, Delta m, is 3000 kilograms.

The change in entropy, Delta S, is calculated as the entropy of mass 2 minus the entropy of mass 1, which equals the change in mass between 1 and 2 times the entropy at input, plus the heat transfer rate from R-Ques, plus the entropy transfer rate between 1 and 2.

The entropy at mass 2, S_m2, is given by the initial mass plus the change in mass between 1 and 2 times the entropy at 2, minus the initial mass times the entropy at 1.

The entropy at 1, S_1, is the entropy at 1g at 100 degrees Celsius plus x_1 times the difference between the entropy in the gas phase and the entropy in the fluid phase at 100 degrees Celsius, which equals 1.33774 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

The entropy in the gas phase at 100 degrees Celsius is 1.306 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin, and the entropy in the fluid phase, S_f, is 7.35849 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

The entropy at 2, S_2, is the entropy in the fluid phase at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 0.95849 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

The entropy at 12, S_12, is 7237.85 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.
