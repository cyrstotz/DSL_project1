The change in entropy, Delta S_12, is equal to the change in mass, Delta m_12, times the difference in specific entropy between state 2 and state 1, plus the heat transferred out, Q_aus_12, divided by the average temperature, T_bar.

The specific entropy at state 1, s_1, at 20 degrees Celsius is 0.2966 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The specific entropy at state 2, s_2, at 700 degrees Celsius is 0.9545 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The average temperature, T_bar, is 285 Kelvin.

The change in entropy, Delta S_12, is 2.5 megajoules per kilogram Kelvin.
