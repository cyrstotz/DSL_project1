The change in entropy, denoted as Delta S, is calculated using the formula:

Delta S equals m2 times s2 minus m1 times s1.

Where s1 is given by the equation:

s1 equals 0.005 minus sf at 100 degrees Celsius plus 0.935 times sf at 100 degrees Celsius.

And s2 is defined as:

s2 equals sf at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 6.9543 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Substituting the values, s1 is calculated as:

s1 equals 1.337 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Using these values in the Delta S formula:

Delta S equals 8.475 times 1.337 minus 5.255 times 0.8548, which results in 7172.6 kilojoules per Kelvin.
