The absolute value of the ratio of T5 over T6 equals the absolute value of the ratio of p5 over p6 raised to the power of (kappa minus one) divided by kappa.

The ratio of 431.9 over T6 equals the absolute value of the ratio of 0.5 over 0.1911 raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4.

T6 equals 328.07 Kelvin.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between h5 and h6 plus the difference in the squares of w5 and w6 divided by two plus the heat transfer rate minus the work rate.

The mass flow rate equals the mass flow rate at the specified condition.

The product of the mass flow rate and the difference in enthalpy between h5 and h6 equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between T5 and T6 plus 0.006 times 431.9.

The difference in enthalpy between h5 and h6 equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the change in temperature, which is the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between T5 and T6, and this equals 1041.45 kilojoules per kilogram.
