The pressure \( p_{B1,2} \) equals the pressure \( p_{g1} \).

The system must still be in equilibrium with the ambient pressure and the gravitational force!

This implies that the pressure \( p_{B1,2} \) equals 1.40 bar.

The temperature \( T_{g1,2} \) equals 0 degrees Celsius.

The gas is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the ice water, where \( x_{Eis,1,2} \) is greater than 0. Therefore, the gas must also remain at a temperature \( T_{g1,2} \) of 0 degrees Celsius, and thus the gas temperature is also at 0 degrees Celsius.
