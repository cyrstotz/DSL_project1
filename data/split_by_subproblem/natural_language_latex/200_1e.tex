The change in entropy, denoted as Delta S_12, is given by the formula Delta S_12 equals m_2 times s_2 minus m_1 times s_1. This formula is repeated for clarity. The mass m_2 is calculated as zero m plus m_1, which equals 9349.37 kilograms. The entropy s_2 at 700 degrees Celsius is 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The entropy s_1 is calculated using the formula x times s_g plus (1 minus x) times s_f, which equals 1.3377 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin at 700 degrees Celsius. Finally, the change in entropy Delta S_12 is calculated to be 7227.93 kilojoules per Kelvin.
