The graph features a diagram with a y-axis labeled with \( p \) [mixed] and an x-axis labeled with \( T \) [Â°C]. The curve starts at the bottom left and rises towards the top right. There are three marked points on the curve: Point 1 is on the curve, Point 2 is to the left of the curve, and Point 3 is below the curve. The region above the curve is labeled as "gas," and the region below the curve is labeled as "liquid."
