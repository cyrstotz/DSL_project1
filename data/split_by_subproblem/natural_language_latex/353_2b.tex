Isentropic: The temperature T6 equals the temperature T5 times the ratio of v0 over v5 raised to the power of (k-1) divided by k, which approximately equals 378.07 Kelvin.

Thrust nozzle

The total mass flow rate times the sum of the specific heat at constant pressure for air times the difference between the stagnation temperature TS and the temperature T6, plus half the difference of the square of the velocity w5 and the square of the velocity w6, equals zero.

This implies that the velocity w6 equals the square root of twice the specific heat at constant pressure for air times the difference between the stagnation temperature TS and the temperature T6, plus half the square of the velocity w5, which approximately equals 507.25 meters per second.
