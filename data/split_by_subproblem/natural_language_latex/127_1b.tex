The average temperature for the process from state e to state a, denoted as T_UF, is equal to the integral from e to a of T dS divided by the difference S_a minus S_e. This simplifies to T times the quantity S_a minus S_e divided by S_a minus S_e, which further simplifies to the integral from e to a of dA divided by S_a minus S_e, and finally equals m times the difference u_a minus u_e divided by S_a minus S_e.
