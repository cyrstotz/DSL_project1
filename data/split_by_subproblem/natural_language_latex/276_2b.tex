The rate of change of u is equal to the rate of change of m times the quantity of h5 minus h6 plus half the difference of the square of w5 and the square of w6.

Given: P6 equals 0.5 bar, w6 equals 220 meters per second, T5 equals 451.9 Kelvin, P6 equals P0 equals 0.171 bar, w5 equals 0.

Using the relationship equation with n equals k equals 1.4,

T0 equals T5 times the ratio of P6 to P5 raised to the power of (k-1) divided by k.

T0 equals 828.075 Kelvin.

For an ideal gas, h5 minus h6 equals cp times the difference between T5 and T6.

w6 equals the square root of twice the quantity of the ratio of m dot over m dot times cp times the difference between T5 and T6 plus half of w5 squared.

w6 equals 220.47 meters per second.
