The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to E2 minus E1. (no kinetic energy, potential energy)

Delta E equals U2 minus U1, which is equal to Q minus W.

Volume work:
W equals m times the quantity one over n times the quantity p1 times V2 minus p1 times V1.
This equals p divided by the quantity V2 minus V1.
