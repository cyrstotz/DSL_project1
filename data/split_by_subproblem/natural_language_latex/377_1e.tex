The difference between M_S2 and M_S1 is equal to the change in M times S_ein plus the quotient of Q_ein over T minus S_ez.
S_ez equals M_S2 minus M_S1 plus the change in M times S_ein minus the quotient of Q_ein over T.

S_ez equals 1012.428 kilojoules.

M_2 equals m_1 plus m_2, which is 9355 kilograms.
Delta M_2 equals 3600.
M_2 equals M_1 plus S_2.
M_1 equals M_A.
S_2 equals S_p at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram.
S_1 equals S_p at 100 degrees Celsius plus x times the difference between S_f at 100 degrees Celsius and S_p at 100 degrees Celsius.
Delta 2 equals 1.3063 plus x times the difference between 7.3540 and 1.3063.
S_2 equals 4.339 kilojoules per kilogram.
S_ein equals S_p at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 0.2966.
Q equals 35 times 10 to the power of 3 kilojoules.
T equals 255 Kelvin.
