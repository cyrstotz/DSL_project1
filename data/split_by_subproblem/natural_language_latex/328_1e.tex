The change in entropy, Delta S, is equal to m2 times s2 minus m1 times s1.

This is calculated as 9355 kilograms times the entropy at 70 degrees Celsius, sf(70째C), minus 5755 kilograms times s1.

The result is 1237.85 b.

s1 is defined as the entropy at 100 degrees Celsius, sf(100째C), plus x times the difference in entropy between sg(100째C) and sf(100째C).

This is calculated as 1.3069 plus 0.0205 times (7.3549 minus 1.3069).

The result is 1.33714.
