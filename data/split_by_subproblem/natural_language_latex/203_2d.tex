The irreversibility exergy, denoted as \( e_{x,irrevers} \), is equal to \( T_0 \) multiplied by \( s_{\sigma 2} \).

The entropy generation \( s_{\sigma 2} \) is given by the equation \( \frac{q}{\dot{m} T} + (s_a - s_e) \), which simplifies to \( s_0 - s_0 \) and further to \( \frac{q_B}{T_B} \).

This can be expanded to \( c_p \left( \ln \left( \frac{T_c}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_0}{p_0} \right) \right) - \frac{q_B}{T_B} \), which simplifies to \( c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_c}{T_0} \right) - \frac{q_B}{T_B} \).

Substituting values, we get \( 1.006 \frac{kJ}{kgK} \ln \left( \frac{340 K}{243.15 K} \right) - \frac{2795 kJ}{1289 K} \), which equals \( 0.5898 \frac{kJ}{kgK} \).

The text mentions "I assume a sign error."

Finally, \( e_{x,irrevers} \) is calculated as \( T_0 \) times the absolute value of \( s_{\sigma 2} \), which is \( 243.15 K \cdot 0.5898 \frac{kJ}{kgK} \) resulting in \( 143.41 \frac{kJ}{kg} \).
