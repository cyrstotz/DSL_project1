Entropy balance around the wall/boundary:

The change in entropy, Delta S, is equal to the sum of the heat transfer divided by the temperature, plus the generated entropy, S_erz.

This implies that the generated entropy, S_erz, is equal to the heat output, Q_aus, divided by the ideal temperature, T_ideal, plus the negative heat output, -Q_aus, divided by the temperature, T.

This equals 0.38 kilojoules per Kelvin.
