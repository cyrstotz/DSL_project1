The average temperature T bar is equal to the integral from s sub a to s sub e of T ds, divided by the difference s sub a minus s sub e.

The difference s sub 2 minus s sub 1 is equal to the integral from T sub 1 to T sub 2 of c sub p divided by T dT.

This equals c times the natural logarithm of the ratio T sub 2 over T sub 1.
