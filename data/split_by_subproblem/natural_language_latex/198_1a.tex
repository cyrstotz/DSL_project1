Q equals the mass flow rate at the inlet times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the mass flow rate at the outlet times the work rate, plus the heat transfer rate Q_R.

The mass flow rate at the outlet equals the mass flow rate at the inlet times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet.

The enthalpy at the inlet, h_ein, at 70 degrees Celsius is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram, according to Table A2.

The enthalpy at the outlet, h_aus, at 100 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram, according to Table A2.

The mass flow rate at the outlet is 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference in enthalpy between 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram and 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram, minus 100 kilojoules per second, which equals negative 67.182 kilojoules per second.
