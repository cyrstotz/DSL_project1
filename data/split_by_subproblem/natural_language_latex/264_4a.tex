The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled Temperature (T) and the y-axis is labeled Pressure (P). The graph displays a closed loop with four key points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The process between these points is described as follows:
- From point 1 to point 2: "adiabatic and reversible (isentropic) compression"
- From point 2 to point 3: "isobaric complete evaporation"
- From point 3 to point 4: "mass steam"
- From point 4 to point 1: "adiabatic expansion"
Additionally, there are annotations indicating "isobaric condensation" and "low-pressure area" near the bottom right of the loop.
