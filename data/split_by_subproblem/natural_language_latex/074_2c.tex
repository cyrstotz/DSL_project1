Energy balance

The exergy change rate of the system is equal to the mass flow rate times the specific exergy of the stream times the expression in brackets. The expression in brackets is the enthalpy at point a minus the enthalpy at point e minus the product of the ambient temperature and the difference in entropy between point a and point e, plus the ratio of the heat transfer rate to the mass flow rate, plus the work rate at point a.
