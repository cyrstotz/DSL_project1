The fraction of the difference between u sub g, 2 and u sub g, 1, all over m sub g, equals q sub 12 minus w sub v. The work done by volume, w sub v, equals the integral from 1 to 2 of p dv, which is an isobaric process. Therefore, w sub v equals m times p times the difference between v sub 2 and v sub 1. The volume v sub 2 equals R times T sub 2 over p sub g, 2, which equals 0.324 cubic meters per kilogram. The volume v sub 2 is also given as 0.9182 cubic meters per kilogram. The pressure p sub g, 2 is 1.4 bar. The mass m sub g is 3.42 grams. The work done by volume, w sub v, equals negative 284.42 Joules. The difference u sub g, 2 minus u sub g, 1 equals c sub v times p sub g, 2 times the difference T sub 2 minus T sub 1, which equals negative 376.5 kilojoules per kilogram. The heat transfer q sub 12 equals m sub g times the difference u sub g, 2 minus u sub g, 1 plus w sub v, which results in negative 1.3688 kilojoules. The absolute value of q sub 12 equals 1.3688 kilojoules.
