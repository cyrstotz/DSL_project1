d) The pressure \( p_{EV} \) is equal to 16 bar plus the fraction of 32 times 9.81 divided by the square of 0.05 times pi, which equals 1.46 bar, and this is equal to \( p_{sat} \). The saturation temperature \( \theta_{1,sat} \) is 0 degrees Celsius.

Energy balance:
The energy at state 1 \( E_1 \) is equal to the energy at state 2 \( E_2 \) plus the heat transfer \( Q_{12} \).
The change in energy \( \Delta E \) is equal to \( Q_{12} \), and \( \Delta E \) is defined as \( E_1 \) minus \( E_2 \).

The change in energy \( \Delta E \) is calculated as \( (0.6 \times u_{test} + 0.4 \times u_{liquid}) \times 1.0 \) kg minus \(((1 - x_2) \times u_{test} + x_2 \times u_{liquid}) \times 0.2 \) kg.

This results in \( 0.2 \times (-200.1) \) minus \((-333.458 + x_2 \times 333.493)\).

This simplifies to \(-13.34 - x_2 \times 33.34 \) which equals \( Q_{12} \) and is given as 1368.2.
