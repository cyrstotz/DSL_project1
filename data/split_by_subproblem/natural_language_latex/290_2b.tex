The inequality x sub ein, two is less than 70, and the values for T sub g, two and p sub three, two are questioned.

Volumes 1 and 2 are identical, the mixture is still in the two-phase region, and the temperature remains constant, T sub 2 equals T sub 1.

The pressure is proportional to the volume, constant because the volume does not change and it is a closed system. p sub three, two equals p sub three, one.

T sub g, two is equal to T sub g, one, because the volume does not decrease. Heat flow p sub three, one because it is isothermal.
