The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as T (Temperature) and the y-axis is labeled as s (Entropy). There are several curves and points marked on the graph:
- A curve labeled "adiabat s equals constant" starting from the bottom left and moving upwards to the right.
- Another curve labeled "adiabat s equals constant" parallel to the first one but starting higher on the y-axis.
- A curve labeled "isobar p_0 equals p_6" starting from the bottom left and moving upwards to the right, intersecting the adiabats.
- Points labeled 1 through 6, with arrows indicating transitions between these points.
- A curve labeled "isotherm" starting from point 1 and moving horizontally to the right.
- A curve labeled "isotherm" starting from point 4 and moving horizontally to the right.
- A curve labeled "isotherm" starting from point 5 and moving horizontally to the right.
- A curve labeled "isotherm" starting from point 6 and moving horizontally to the right.
