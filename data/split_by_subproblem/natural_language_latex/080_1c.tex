The rate of entropy change in cruise, denoted as S dot subscript crz, approaches zero and is given by the equation:
S dot subscript crz approaches zero equals m dot times the difference of s subscript e and s subscript a, plus Q dot subscript zu divided by T, plus S dot subscript irz.

The equation for S dot subscript crz is then given as:
S dot subscript crz equals m dot times the difference of s subscript e and s subscript a, plus Q dot subscript zu divided by T, plus Q subscript aus divided by T.

Substituting values, the equation becomes:
S dot subscript crz equals 0.3 times the difference of 7.553 and 0.948, plus the difference of 100 kW and 41.264 kW divided by 298.15 K.

Finally, the value of S subscript crz is calculated as:
S subscript crz equals 2.225 kJ per kg per K.
