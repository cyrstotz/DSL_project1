The average temperature \( T_{L,EF} \) is equal to the integral from \( S_e \) to \( S_a \) of \( T \) dS divided by \( S_a - S_e \), which simplifies to \( T_{KEF} \) times the fraction \( \frac{S_e - S_a}{S_a - S_e} \). This expression is then multiplied by the natural logarithm of the ratio \( \frac{T_{ein}}{T_{aus}} \).

This further simplifies to \( T_{KEF,aus} \) times the natural logarithm of the ratio \( \frac{288.15}{298.15} \), which equals \( T_{KEF,aus} \) times the fraction of the natural logarithm of \( \frac{288.15}{298.15} \) over the natural logarithm of \( \frac{T_{ein}}{T_{aus}} \).
