The first equation is the derivative of E with respect to t equals the product of m-dot-in and h-in of t plus Q-dot-R minus Q-dot-out minus the product of m-dot-out and h-out of t, which equals zero.

The second equation is Q-dot-out equals Q-dot-R plus the product of m-dot-in and the difference between h-in and h-out.

The third expression is Delta h.

The fourth equation is Delta h equals 700,000 L plus 0.3 kJ per second times one third times Delta h.
