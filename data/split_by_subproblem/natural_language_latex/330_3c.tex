Energy flow:
The derivative of E with respect to t equals the sum of Q minus the sum of W.
The change in internal energy, Delta U, equals Q_ab minus the integral from 1 to 2 of p dV.

For the second part:
U goes to eta isothermically.
s1 equals s2 which equals sf at f1 which is sf at 85 bar.
X_eta equals the fraction where the numerator is s1 minus sf and the denominator is sg minus sf.
