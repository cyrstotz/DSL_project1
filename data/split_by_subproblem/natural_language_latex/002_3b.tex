The pressure \( p_{G2} \) equals \( p_{G1} \) which is 1.4 bar, and the external pressure on the gas has not changed.

The variable \( x_{eis2} \) is greater than 0, which implies that not all the ice has melted, therefore the temperature \( T_{EW2} \) equals \( T_{EW1} \).

The temperature \( T_{EW2} \) is 0 degrees Celsius, which is equal to \( T_{G2} \), since there is no heat flow, the temperatures are the same.
