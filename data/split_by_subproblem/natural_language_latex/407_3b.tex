The probability \( P_{3,2} \) equals \( P_{4,1} \). Yes, it reaches but then does not change. Through very similar. At point 2, no more heat flows, which leads to half of the average temperature \( \overline{T_{ew2}} \). Since the emergency valve is not completely closed, its temperature remains constant. The temperature \( T_{g2} \) equals 0 degrees Celsius.
