Assumption: mass flow rate, m-dot-zero equals 350 kilograms per hour.

Required: Change in exergy, Delta e-str, between 0 to 6, which implies the exergy balance of a flow.

The change in exergy, Delta e-str, is given by:
h-six minus h-zero minus T-zero times (s-six minus s-zero) plus one-half v-six squared minus one-half v-zero squared.

This can be expanded to:
c-p-zero times (T-six minus T-zero) minus T-zero times (c-p-zero times the natural logarithm of (T-six over T-zero) minus R times the natural logarithm of (p-six over p-zero)) plus one-half v-six squared minus one-half v-zero squared.

Simplifying further:
c-p-zero times (T-six minus T-zero) minus T-zero times c-p-zero times the natural logarithm of (T-six over T-zero) plus T-zero times R times the natural logarithm of (p-six over p-zero) plus one-half v-six squared minus one-half v-zero squared.

With c-p-zero equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, T-zero equals 30 degrees Celsius, T-six equals 293.7 Kelvin.

This results in:
Delta e-str equals 540.57 kilojoules per kilogram minus 46.37 kilojoules per kilogram plus 110.05 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, Delta e-str equals 603.7 kilojoules per kilogram.
