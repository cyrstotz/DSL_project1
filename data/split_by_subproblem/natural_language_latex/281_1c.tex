Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the inlet entropy and the outlet entropy, plus the heat transfer rate into the system divided by the temperature, minus the heat transfer rate out of the system divided by the temperature, plus the entropy flow rate at evaporation stage 2.

The entropy flow rate at evaporation stage 2 equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the outlet entropy and the inlet entropy, plus the heat transfer rate out of the system divided by the temperature, minus the heat transfer rate into the system divided by the temperature.

The values for inlet entropy and outlet entropy are from part b.

The entropy flow rate at evaporation stage 2 equals 0.3 times the difference between 1.3069 and 0.9544, plus 65 divided by 295, minus 100 divided by 295.

This results in negative 0.0473 kilojoules per Kelvin.
