The description is of a graph which is a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram. The y-axis is labeled as 'p' and the x-axis is labeled as 'V'. The graph includes four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The transition from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "Isotherm", from point 2 to point 3 as "Isentrop", from point 3 to point 4 as "Isotherm", and from point 4 back to point 1 as "Isentrop". Point 2 is specifically marked as "ND". The graph illustrates a cyclic process with arrows showing the direction of the process.
