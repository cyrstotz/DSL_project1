The content describes a graph with temperature (T) in Kelvin on the y-axis and entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin on the x-axis. The graph features a dome-shaped curve labeled "wet steam area." The left side of the dome is labeled "Solid" and the right side is labeled "vapor gaseous." Points z1, z2, z3 are marked on the graph. There is a horizontal line connecting points z2 and z3 at the top of the dome. A vertical line connects point z2 to the x-axis.
