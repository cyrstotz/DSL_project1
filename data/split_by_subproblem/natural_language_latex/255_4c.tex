For subtask c), the equations are as follows:

h subscript 2 implies h subscript tp, and h subscript 1 at 3.3756 bar equals h subscript f plus x subscript n times the difference of h subscript fg and h subscript f.

x subscript n equals the fraction where the numerator is h subscript 2 minus h subscript f, and the denominator is the difference of h subscript fg and h subscript f.
