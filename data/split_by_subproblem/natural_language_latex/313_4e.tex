The section discusses stationary processes.

The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance, plus the sum of heat transfer rates minus the sum of work rates.

The work equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance.
