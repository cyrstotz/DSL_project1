Underlined Energy balance of the thrust nozzle: stationary flow process
The equation zero equals the total mass flow rate times the quantity of h5 minus h0 plus the difference of w5 squared minus w0 squared all over two.

The equation zero equals C_p times the difference of T5 minus T0 plus the difference of w5 squared minus w0 squared all over two.

The equation for T0 equals T5 plus the difference of w5 squared minus w0 squared all over two times C_p.

Underlined Energy balance of the entire system:
The equation zero equals the total mass flow rate times the quantity of h0 minus h4 plus the difference of the squared speed of air minus w0 squared all over two plus the mass flow rate of fuel times the enthalpy of fuel.

The equation zero equals h0 minus h4 plus the difference of the squared speed of air minus w0 squared all over two plus 0.159 times the mass flow rate of fuel times the enthalpy of fuel.

This equals C_p times the difference of T0 minus T4 plus the difference of the squared speed of air minus w0 squared all over two plus 0.159 times the mass flow rate of fuel times the enthalpy of fuel.

Ellipsis, solve equations for T0 and w0.

The equation zero equals C_p times the difference of T0 minus T5 plus the difference of w5 squared minus w0 squared all over two times C_p plus the difference of the squared speed of air minus w0 squared all over two plus 0.159 times the mass flow rate of fuel times the enthalpy of fuel.
