Energy Balance

Closed System:
The change in energy minus the sum of heat transfer minus the sum of work done equals zero. This is expressed as:
- The initial equation is Delta E minus the sum of Q minus the sum of dot W equals zero.
- This equals m_EW times the quantity X times U_E plus (1 minus X) times U_W minus 0.6 times U_E plus 0.4 times U_W, which equals Q_12.
- This further simplifies to m_EW times the quantity (X minus 333) times (U_E minus U_W) plus U_EW.
- Solving for X, we get X equals Q_12 divided by m_EW plus 0.6 times U_E minus 0.4 times U_W minus U_W.
- Substituting the values, X equals 1500 divided by 3.6 plus 0.6 times negative 333.458 minus 0.4 times 0.0045 minus 0.0033.
- This results in X equals negative 833.442 minus 0.0033.
- Further simplifying, X equals negative 0.65 minus 0.64965.
- Finally, X equals negative 0.65 and is also expressed as negative 0.650.
