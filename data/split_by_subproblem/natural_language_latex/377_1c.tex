The freezing temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is 285 Kelvin.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance, plus the heat flow rate out divided by the freezing temperature, minus the entropy flow rate due to cooling.

The entropy flow rate due to cooling \( \dot{s}_{\text{cz}} \) equals the heat flow rate out divided by the freezing temperature.

Substituting the values, the entropy flow rate due to cooling \( \dot{s}_{\text{cz}} \) equals 62,182 kilowatts divided by 285 Kelvin.

This results in the entropy flow rate due to cooling \( \dot{s}_{\text{cz}} \) being approximately 0.2107 kilowatts per Kelvin minus the entropy flow rate due to cooling \( \dot{s}_{\text{cz}} \).
