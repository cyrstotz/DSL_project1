Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet for water, minus the heat transfer rate divided by the coolant temperature. The entropy transfer rate equals the heat transfer rate divided by the coolant temperature, which leads to the entropy transfer rate being zero point three two six kilowatts per Kelvin.

The change in entropy, Delta S twelve, equals the total mass plus the change in mass twelve times the entropy at state two minus the total mass times the entropy at state one, which equals one thousand two hundred thirty-seven point eight four eight eight kilojoules per Kelvin.

Entropy at state two, S two, is a function of temperature T, which equals zero point nine five two four nine kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Entropy at state one, S one, equals the entropy at the saturated liquid plus the quality times the difference between the entropy at the saturated vapor and the entropy at the saturated liquid, which equals one point two three seven four four kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
