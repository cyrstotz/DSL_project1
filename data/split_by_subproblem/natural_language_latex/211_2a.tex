Graph Description:
The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as s in units of kilojoules per Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled as T in Kelvin. The graph shows a cycle with four points labeled as p0, p1, p2, and p3. The process from p0 to p1 is labeled as "isentropic", from p1 to p2 as "isobaric", from p2 to p3 as "isentropic", and from p3 to p0 as "isobaric". The cycle is clockwise. The region below the cycle is labeled as "entropic".
