The rate of exergy change for the process, denoted as dot E subscript x, ver, equals the product of T subscript 0 and the rate of entropy generation for the process, dot S subscript ver, which equals e subscript x, ver, in.

The rate of entropy generation for the process, dot S subscript ver, equals the product of the mass flow rate, dot m, and the change in entropy, Delta S, minus the heat transfer rate, Q subscript i, divided by the temperature, T. This is calculated as 100 kilojoules per kilogram minus 1795 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 1289 Kelvin, which equals 99.07.

This implies that the exergy, e subscript x, equals 240.85 megajoules.
