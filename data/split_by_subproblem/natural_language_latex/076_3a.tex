p three one is unknown.
m sub g is unknown.
C sub V, gas equals 0.653 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
M sub g equals 50 kilograms per kilomole.
R sub g equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin divided by M sub g, which equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
T sub three over one equals 500 degrees Celsius, which is 773.15 Kelvin.
V sub three over one equals 3.14 liters, which is 0.00314 cubic meters.
A sub K equals pi times (D over 2) squared, which equals pi times (0.1 over 2) squared, which equals 0.00785 cubic meters.
p sub g equals p sub ambient plus m sub g times g divided by A sub K plus m sub EW times g divided by A sub K, which equals p sub ambient plus g over A sub K times (m sub g plus m sub EW).
p sub three one equals 1 bar plus 0.1 over A sub K times (32 plus 0.1), which equals 1.4 bars.

Density times V equals m times R times T.
m equals p sub three times V sub three divided by R sub g times T sub three, which equals 1.4 bars times 0.00314 cubic meters divided by 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times 773.15 Kelvin, which equals 3.47 grams.
