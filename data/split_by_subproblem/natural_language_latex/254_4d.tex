The equation for \( h_1 \) is given by \( h_1 = h_e + x_1 (h_g - h_f) \) which equals \( 87.6632 \) kilojoules per kilogram, with values taken from Table A-10.

The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{u}} \) is calculated as \( \dot{m} \) times the difference \( (h_2 - h_1) \).

The value of \( h_2 \) is equal to \( h_g \) which is \( 237.74 \) kilojoules per kilogram, according to Table A-10.

This results in the heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{u}} \) being \( 62.7 \) watts.

The energy ratio \( E_{\text{u}} \) is calculated as the ratio of \( \dot{Q}_{\text{u}} \) to \( \dot{W}_{\text{n}} \), which equals \( 2.24 \).
