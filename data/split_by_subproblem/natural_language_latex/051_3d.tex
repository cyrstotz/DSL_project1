The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is 1500 Joules from adjustment.

The pressure \( p_{2|EW} \) is equal to the ambient pressure \( p_{amb} \) plus the ratio of the mass of the object \( m_{K} \) times gravity \( g \) over the area \( A \), which equals 1.4 bar (from Table 1).

The quality at state 1, \( x_{E,1} \), is 0.6.

The internal energy at state 1, \( U_{Ew,1} \), is calculated as \( x \) times negative 333.458 kilojoules per kilogram plus \( (1 - x) \) times negative 0.085 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals negative 20.093 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy at state 2, \( U_{EW,2} \), is the internal energy at state 1, \( U_{EW,1} \), plus the change in internal energy \( \Delta U \), which is \( U_{E,1} \) plus \( Q_{12} \), resulting in negative 185.0528.

The internal energy at state 2, \( U_{EW,2} \), is also calculated as \( x_2 \) times negative 333.458 kilojoules per kilogram plus \( (1 - x_2) \) times negative 0.085 kilojoules per kilogram.

Setting the internal energy at state 2 to negative 185.0528, we solve for \( x_2 \), which equals approximately 0.555.
