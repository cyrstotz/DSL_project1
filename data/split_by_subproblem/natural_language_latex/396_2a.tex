The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled as temperature in Kelvin. There are two isobaric lines: one labeled 0.5 bar and the other labeled 0.9316 bar. The graph shows two vertical arrows indicating processes at constant entropy. The first arrow starts at point O and ends at point 5 on the 0.5 bar line. The second arrow starts at point O and ends at point L on the 0.9316 bar line. Both arrows are labeled as "adiabatic".
