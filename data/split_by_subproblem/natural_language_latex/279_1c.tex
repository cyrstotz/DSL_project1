Zero equals the mass flow rate at the inlet times the difference between the entropy at the inlet and the entropy at the outlet, plus the heat flow rate out divided by the condensation temperature, plus the heat flow rate due to radiation divided by the radiation temperature, plus the generated entropy.

The generated entropy equals the mass flow rate at the inlet times the difference between the entropy at the outlet and the entropy at the inlet, plus the heat flow rate out divided by the condensation temperature, which equals the heat flow rate due to radiation divided by the radiation temperature.

The generated entropy equals negative the heat flow rate out divided by the condensation temperature, which equals 0.212 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
