The rate of change of entropy, S dot, with respect to time, t, is equal to the sum over i of the mass flow rate, m dot subscript i, times the entropy, s subscript i, plus the sum over i of the heat transfer rate, Q dot subscript i, divided by the temperature, T subscript i, plus the generated entropy, S dot subscript erz.

The generated entropy, S dot subscript erz, is equal to the mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference between the entropy at the outlet, s subscript aus, and the entropy at the inlet, s subscript ein, plus the heat transfer rate at the boundary, Q subscript ab, divided by the job temperature, T subscript job.

This equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, c superscript i, times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the outlet temperature, T subscript aus, to the inlet temperature, T subscript ein, plus 65 kilowatts divided by 295 Kelvin.

The generated entropy, S dot subscript erz, is equal to the circulating mass flow rate, m dot subscript uml, times the specific heat capacity at constant pressure for the circulating fluid, c superscript i subscript uml, times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 288.15 Kelvin to 285.15 Kelvin, plus 0.22 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
