Steady flow with mass stream:

The equation pV equals mRT.

The equation zero equals m dot times the difference of h5 and h6 plus the difference of W dot 5 squared and W dot 6 squared over 2 plus Q dot minus W dot e.

1st Law of Thermodynamics:

The equation zero equals m dot times the difference of h2 and h3 plus Q dot minus W dot.

The equation zero equals m dot times c_p times the difference of T2 and T3 plus Q dot over m dot.

The equation zero equals m dot ges times the sum of c_p times the difference of T1 and T6 plus the difference of W dot 2 squared and W dot 6 squared over 2.

The equation m dot ges equals m dot K plus m dot M.

The equation T2 equals T1 times the fraction of p2 over p1 raised to the power of (k minus 1) over k.

The equation p2 equals p3.

The equation T6 equals the fraction of pV over RT.

The equation R equals c_p minus c_v.

The equation k equals the fraction of c_p over c_v.

The equation c_p equals the fraction of c_p over k equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The equation c_v equals the fraction of 1.006 over 1.4 equals 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
