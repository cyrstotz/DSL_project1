If \( x_{eis,2} > 0 \), this means that \( T_{ew,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).

Since the ice-water mixture and the gas are in thermodynamic equilibrium, \( T_{gr,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \) as well.

\( P_{gr,2} \) can also be found using \( pV = mRT \), but it is not needed.

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is calculated as:

\[
p_{g,2} = \frac{m_{g,1} \cdot R \cdot T_{g,2}}{V}
\]

since the external pressure remains the same (\( \Delta m = 0 \)),

\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.1 \text{ bar}
\]
