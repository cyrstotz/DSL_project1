The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) equals \( p_{g,1} \), since \( m_g \) the mass and the ambient pressure do not change.

Since there is still ice present (so-called thermodynamic equilibrium prevails), the temperature of the gas is the same as that of the ice/water and thus 0 degrees Celsius or 273.15 Kelvin.
