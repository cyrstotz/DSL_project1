Verbal description of the diagram:

The diagram is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The vertical axis represents temperature (T) and the horizontal axis represents entropy (s). There are two vertical lines labeled \( s_{out} \) and \( s_{in} \). The line \( s_{out} \) is on the left and \( s_{in} \) is on the right. There is a horizontal line at the top labeled \( T_{KF} \) and another horizontal line at the bottom labeled \( T_R \). There is a vertical arrow labeled \( \dot{Q}_{out} \) pointing upwards between the two vertical lines. The area between the vertical lines and the horizontal lines is shaded.

Entropy balance:

\[
\dot{S}_{er} = \dot{Q}_{out} \left( \frac{1}{T_{KF}} - \frac{1}{T_R} \right)
\]

\[
\dot{S}_{er} = 62.193 \, \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}} \left( \frac{1}{293.12} - \frac{1}{298.45} \right) = 45.49 \, \frac{\text{W}}{\text{K}}
\]
