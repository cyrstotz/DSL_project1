Zero equals the mass flow rate of KF times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and at entry plus the heat transfer rate to the surroundings.

The heat transfer rate to the surroundings equals the mass flow rate of KF times the difference between the enthalpy at entry and at exit.

The mass flow rate of KF equals the heat transfer rate to the surroundings divided by the specific heat capacity at constant pressure times the quantity of the inlet temperature times the sum of the inverse of the efficiency times the change in temperature plus the velocity divided by the second pressure.

This equals 63.3 kilowatts divided by the specific heat capacity times the difference between 238.15 and 288.15.

This equals 63.3 kilowatts divided by 6.33 kilowatts per Kelvin equals the mass flow rate of KF times the specific heat capacity.

The average temperature T-bar equals the integral from the entropy at exit to the entropy at entry of T ds divided by the difference between the entropy at entry and at exit, which equals the difference between the enthalpy at entry and at exit divided by the difference between the entropy at entry and at exit, which equals the heat transfer rate out divided by the mass flow rate of KF times the reciprocal of the difference between the entropy at entry and at exit, which equals 6.33 kilowatts per Kelvin times if divided by 6.33 kilowatts per Kelvin times if times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the inlet temperature to the outlet temperature.

This implies that 10 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of the ratio of 288.15 Kelvin to 278.15 Kelvin equals 293.12 Kelvin.
