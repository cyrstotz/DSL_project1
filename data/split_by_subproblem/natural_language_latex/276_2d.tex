The extended energy, denoted as e_{x,verl}, is equal to the difference between the entropy generation rate, denoted as dot{S}_{erz}, and the product of the ambient temperature, T_0, divided by the total mass, m_{ges}.

The term "Energieklau" translates to "Energy theft" and it is stated that the entropy generation rate, dot{S}_{erz}, is for a flowing, adiabatic process, which implies that dot{S}_{erz} equals the mass flow rate, dot{m}, times the difference between the entropy at state q and state c.

Further, it is stated that dot{S}_{erz} equals the difference between the entropy at state L and the base entropy, s_0.

The difference between the entropy at state L and the base entropy, s_0, is given by the specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the temperature at state L to the ambient temperature, T_0.

Finally, substituting all the values, the extended energy, e_{x,verl}, is calculated and presented in a box as 82.01 kilojoules per kilogram.
