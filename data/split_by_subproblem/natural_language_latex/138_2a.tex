The subsection includes:

- A list with two items labeled (i) and (ii), where item (i) is represented by the symbol dot Q, and item (ii) is represented by the symbol T.

- A table with one header row and three subsequent rows. The header row contains the entries: blank, S1, S2, S3, S4. The rows beneath the header are labeled T1, T0, and T3, respectively, but all cells in these rows are empty.

- Another list with three items:
  1. "adiabatic (reversible)" which implies S1 equals S2.
  2. "isobaric, isothermal."
  3. This item is empty.

- Lastly, there is a notation indicating a transition from T1 to T2.
