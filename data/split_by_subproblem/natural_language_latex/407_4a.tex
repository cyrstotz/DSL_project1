A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. The graph shows three phases: solid, liquid, and gas. There is a curve labeled "isotherm" that separates the solid and gas phases. The point where the solid, liquid, and gas phases meet is labeled "triple point". Points are marked on the graph:
- Point 1 is in the liquid region.
- Point 2 is in the solid region.
- Point 3 is in the gas region.
The x-axis is labeled \( T \) and the y-axis is labeled \( p \).
