The graph is a Pressure-Volume (P-v) diagram. The y-axis is labeled as P in megapascals (MPa). The x-axis is labeled as v in cubic meters per kilogram (m^3/kg). There are several points and curves on the graph:
- Point 1 is at the intersection of the isobar and the isotherm lines.
- Point 2 is on the isobar line, to the right of point 1.
- Point 3 is on the isotherm line, above point 2.
- Point 4 is on the isotherm line, above point 1.
- The curve labeled "isobar" connects points 1 and 2.
- The curve labeled "isotherm" connects points 2 and 3.
- The curve labeled "isotherm" connects points 1 and 4.
- The curve labeled "wet steam" connects points 1 and 3.
- The curve labeled "gas" connects points 3 and 4.
- The curve labeled "liquid" connects points 1 and 2.
The critical point, denoted as T_crit, is marked on the isotherm line.
