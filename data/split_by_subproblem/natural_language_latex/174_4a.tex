The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled 's' and the y-axis is labeled 'T'. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The process from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "adiabat" and is represented by a vertical line. The process from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isobar" and is represented by a horizontal line. The process from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "adiabat" and is again a vertical line. The process from point 4 to point 1 is labeled "isobar" and is a horizontal line. There is a point labeled "Triple" near the top left of the graph. The graph also includes a curve labeled "isobar" that intersects the points 1 and 4.
