The change in entropy, denoted as Delta S subscript x2, is equal to the natural logarithm of 3a minus the natural logarithm of 3n. This can be rewritten as the sum of the natural logarithm and the natural logarithm of 3, all subscript x2, minus the natural logarithm of 3n. The next line is labeled "TBA A-2" and shows a calculation involving the sum of 5755 kilograms and 3756.8 kilograms, multiplied by 8 times 70 degrees Celsius. This results in 5755 kilograms multiplied by 8 times 100 degrees Celsius, where x equals 0.005.

The final value is 1387.7 kilojoules per Kelvin.

Additionally, the expression 8 times 100 degrees Celsius, where x equals 0.005, is calculated as 1.806 plus 0.005 times the difference between 7.3545 and 1.306. This results in 1.83741 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.
