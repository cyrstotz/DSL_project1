The work W is equal to the mass flow rate dot m times the difference in enthalpy between h2 and h1.

The mass flow rate dot m is equal to the work W divided by the difference in enthalpy between h2 and h1.

The mass flow rate dot m is equal to 28 divided by the difference in enthalpy between h2 and h3, which equals 3.24 kilograms.
