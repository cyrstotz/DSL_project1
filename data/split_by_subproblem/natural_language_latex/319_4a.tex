- Graph 1: The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as T_ink and the y-axis labeled as p_char. There are two curves intersecting each other. One curve starts from the top left and goes downwards to the bottom right, while the other curve starts from the bottom left and goes upwards to the top right. There are annotations indicating "as shown in (*)", and "p_ink goes downwards to the right".
- Graph 2: The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as T_ink and the y-axis labeled as p_ink. There are three vertical lines labeled as "solid", "liquid", and "gas". The "solid" line is annotated with "sour", "amber", and "sour". The "liquid" line is annotated with "H_2O" and "Li". The "gas" line is annotated with "H_2".
