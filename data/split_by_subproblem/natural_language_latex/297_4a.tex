A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "MD-Kühlst." and the y-axis labeled as "p over p1". The graph shows a curve that starts from the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls down to a lower level, and then rises again slightly. Points are marked on the curve as follows:
- Point 1 is at the initial rise.
- Point 2 is at the peak.
- Point 3 is at the first fall.
- Point 4 is at the second rise.
A horizontal line is drawn from point 1 to point 3, labeled as "Isobar". A vertical line is drawn from point 3 to point 4, labeled as "Isotherm". The area between these lines is shaded. Additional labels include "MD-Kühlst." and "T1".
