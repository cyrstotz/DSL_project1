Energy Balance around the Boiler

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance, plus the sum of heat transfer rates minus the rate of entropy generation at the wall.

The enthalpy at the exit equals the enthalpy of the fluid plus x times the difference between the enthalpy of the gas and the enthalpy of the fluid, where the enthalpy of the fluid remains the same and x equals zero.

The enthalpy of the gas is given at 100 degrees Celsius, and the enthalpy of the fluid is also given at 100 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy at the entrance equals the enthalpy of the fluid plus x times the enthalpy difference between the fluid and the gas.

The enthalpy at the entrance is 292.18 kilojoules per kilogram.

The mass flow rate is 0.3 kilograms per second.

The heat transfer rate out is calculated as the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance, which equals 0.3 times the difference between 430.325 and 292.18, resulting in 41.264 kilowatts.
