1. Heat system over water, stationary, mass flow rate is constant.

The equation is zero equals mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between entry and exit, plus the rate of heat added, minus the rate of heat removed, minus the work done.

The rate of heat removed equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between entry and exit, plus the rate of heat added.

The enthalpy at entry is 292.985 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at exit is 429.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The rate of heat removed is 62.182 kilowatts.
