The temperature \( T_{s2} \) is 0 degrees Celsius.

Not all the ice has melted yet, and still, the two chambers are in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means that the expansion vessel has a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius and so does the gas inside it.

The pressure \( p_{s2} \) equals \( p_{s4} \) and is underlined as 1.4 bar.

The atmospheric pressure and the weight force of the piston and expansion vessel are still acting on the same area. The expansion vessel is always equally dense. Thus, the pressure is always the same.
