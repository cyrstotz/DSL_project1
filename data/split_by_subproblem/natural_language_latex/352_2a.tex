The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled "T" and the horizontal axis is labeled "S [kJ/kgK]". The graph consists of six points labeled from 0 to 5, connected by lines. The points and their connections are as follows:
- Point 0 is at the origin.
- Point 1 is above and to the right of Point 0, connected by a curved line.
- Point 2 is directly above Point 1, connected by a vertical line labeled "isobar".
- Point 3 is above and to the right of Point 2, connected by a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 4 is below and to the right of Point 3, connected by a line labeled "isentrop".
- Point 5 is directly above Point 4, connected by a vertical line labeled "isobar".
- Point 6 is below and to the right of Point 5, connected by a line labeled "isentrop".

At point 1, the air splits up, m2 goes through the turbine process, while m1 is directly led to the mixing chamber.

The equation m dot times the sum of h equals the sum of Q dot minus the sum of W dot.

The equation zero equals m dot times (h_in minus h_out).
