The average temperature T-bar is given by the equation:

T-bar equals the integral from S-a to S-e of T ds divided by S-a minus S-e, which equals Delta U divided by c-if times the natural logarithm of T-a over T-e, which further equals Delta U divided by c-if times the natural logarithm of (T-aus minus T-ein) over T-ein.

In the next equation, T-bar equals (288.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin) divided by the natural logarithm of (288.15 Kelvin over 288.15 Kelvin), which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
