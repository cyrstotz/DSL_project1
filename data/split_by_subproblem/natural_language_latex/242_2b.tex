p1 equals 0.1 bar.

The mass flow rate, m dot, equals p1 times v1 divided by R times T1.

Q equals m dot times the quantity h5 plus one half w5 squared minus h6 minus one half w6 squared, which equals wt.

Implying for the Thrust Nozzle:

The ratio of T6 over T5 equals the ratio of p6 over p5 raised to the power of (kappa minus 1) divided by kappa.

kappa equals 1.4.

Therefore, T6 equals T5 times the ratio of p6 over p5 raised to the power of (kappa minus 1) divided by kappa, which equals 328.14.

Implying for the Energy Equation of the entire turbine:

Q equals m dot times the quantity h0 plus one half w0 squared minus h6 minus one half w6 squared plus Q dot times beta times the quantity 1 plus one half w6 squared.

One half w0 squared equals cp times (T0 minus T6) plus one half w0 squared plus a3 times 0.2033.

Therefore, w0 equals the square root of 2 times the quantity cp times (T0 minus T6) plus one half w0 squared plus a3 times 0.2033.

This results in w0 equals 438.866 meters per second.
