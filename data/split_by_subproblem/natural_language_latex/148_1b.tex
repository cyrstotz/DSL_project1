The rate of change of temperature in the cooling jacket, denoted as T with a dot subscript KF, is not equal to zero, which implies that the rate of change of entropy in the external zone, denoted as s with a dot subscript ez, equals zero.

The rate of change of temperature, T with a dot, is equal to the difference between T2 and T1 divided by the natural logarithm of T2 divided by T1, which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
