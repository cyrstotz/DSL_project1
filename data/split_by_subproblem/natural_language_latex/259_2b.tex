Zero equals the mass flow rate times the quantity of the enthalpy at entry plus the difference of the square of the exit velocity and the square of the entry velocity divided by two, plus the total heat flow rate, plus the work done by the turbine.

The ratio of temperature T6 to T5 equals the ratio of pressure p6 to p5 raised to the power of (n minus one) divided by n.

T6 equals T5 times the ratio of pressure p6 to p5 raised to the power of (14 minus 1) divided by 14, which equals 328.07 Kelvin.

The pressure p0 equals the critical pressure pc, which is 0.192 bar.
