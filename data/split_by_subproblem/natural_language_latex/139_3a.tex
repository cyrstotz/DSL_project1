a) The equation is rho times V equals mRT.

The first equation calculates m_00 as follows:
m_00 equals rho times V_1 divided by R times T_1, which equals E over A times V_1 divided by R times T_1. Substituting the values, it becomes (32.1 times 40080 divided by 8.314 times 3.14) divided by (50 times (500 plus 273.15)) equals approximately 9.983 grams.

The second equation calculates rho as:
rho equals E over A, which equals (F_K plus E_W) divided by (A times r_2). Substituting the values, it becomes 4087.059939 divided by 40080, which approximately equals 4087 Newtons per square meter.
