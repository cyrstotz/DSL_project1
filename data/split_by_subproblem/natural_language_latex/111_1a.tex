Energy balance around the reaction mixture:

"stationary implies zero equals the mass flow rate in times (enthalpy in minus enthalpy out) plus heat flow rate due to reaction minus heat flow rate out plus shaft work."

Boiling liquid is equivalent to being in the two-phase region with x equals zero.

"enthalpy in equals enthalpy at fluid state equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table A2)."

"enthalpy out equals enthalpy at fluid state at 100 degrees Celsius equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram."

"implies the heat flow rate out equals 0.3 times [292.98 minus 419.04] plus 100 equals 62.182 kilowatts."
