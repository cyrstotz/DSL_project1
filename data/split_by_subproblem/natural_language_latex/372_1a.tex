1. Left-hand side: zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference in enthalpy between h1 and h2, plus the heat added, minus the heat removed.

The heat removed, denoted as Q dot ab, aus, equals the mass flow rate in times the difference in enthalpy between h1 and h2, plus the heat added.

The enthalpy h1 at 70 degrees Celsius is 283.29298 kilojoules per kilogram, as found in Table A-2.

The enthalpy h2 at 100 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram, as found in Table A-2.

The calculated heat removed, Q dot ab, aus, equals 0.3 times the difference in enthalpy between h1 and h2 plus 100, which equals 62.182.

This value is boxed and expressed as 62.182 kilowatts.
