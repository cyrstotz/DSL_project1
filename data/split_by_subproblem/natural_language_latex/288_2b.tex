The equations and descriptions are as follows:

1. The first equation is represented in a matrix form with two rows:
   - o arrow to o
   - o arrow to 6

2. The second equation is:
   Zero equals the total mass flow rate (dot m subscript GES) times the expression (h subscript 0 minus h subscript 6 plus half of u subscript kLuft squared minus half of u subscript 6 squared) plus the heat flow rate from 1 to 6 (dot Q subscript 16 superscript 0) minus the power loss from 1 to 6 (dot L subscript 16 superscript 0).

3. The third equation is enclosed in curly braces:
   Zero equals the total mass flow rate (dot m subscript GES) times the expression (h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 plus half of u subscript kLuft squared minus half of u subscript 6 squared) plus the heat flow rate for SG (dot Q subscript SG superscript 0) minus the power loss for SG (dot L subscript SG superscript 0).

Description of the figures:
- The first figure is a rectangle with arrows pointing to the left and right, labeled as "o" and "6".
- The second figure is a trapezoid with arrows pointing to the left and right, labeled as "5" and "6".
- The third figure is a shaded rectangle.
