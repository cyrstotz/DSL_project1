A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as p and the x-axis labeled as T. The graph displays a phase diagram with a curve that starts from the origin and bends upwards to the right. There are three points marked on the graph:
- Point 1 is on the right side of the curve, labeled as "Gas".
- Point 2 is on the curve, labeled as "isobar".
- Point 3 is below the curve, labeled as "Liquid".

The curve is labeled as "isotherm" and "Triple". There are arrows indicating transitions between the points:
- An arrow from point 1 to point 2 labeled as "isobar".
- An arrow from point 2 to point 3 labeled as "isotherm".

The region above the curve is labeled as "Gas" and the region below the curve is labeled as "Liquid".
