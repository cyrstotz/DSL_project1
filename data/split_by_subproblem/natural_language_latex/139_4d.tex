The efficiency eta subscript K is equal to the ratio of Q dot subscript zu over W dot subscript t, which equals the ratio of the difference between Q dot subscript ab and Q dot subscript zu over Q dot subscript ab, and this is equal to the ratio of Q dot subscript K over W dot subscript K.

Q dot subscript K is defined as "energy transition."

Q dot subscript K equals the mass flow rate dot m times the expression (h subscript e minus h subscript a plus one half times the difference between v subscript e squared and v subscript a squared plus g times the difference between z subscript e and z subscript a) times Q dot subscript K minus Q subscript e.

The rate of change of energy with respect to time dE/dt is equal to the sum over i of Q subscript i minus the sum over n of W subscript n.

Energy E equals internal energy U minus kinetic energy KE minus potential energy PE, leading to the change in energy Delta E equals the change in internal energy Delta U.

The change in volume Delta V equals Q dot subscript K.
