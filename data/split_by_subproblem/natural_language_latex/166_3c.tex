c) For a closed system, the initial temperature T_0,12 is 0.008 degrees Celsius.

The change in internal energy is given by the equation:
Delta U equals Q minus W.

For the gas, the change in internal energy is calculated as:
Delta U_gas equals the mass flow rate times the specific heat capacity times the temperature difference between T_3 and T_om, which equals the mass flow rate of 0.163 kilograms per second times the specific heat capacity times the temperature difference between T_gm and T_om, and this equals Q minus W.

For the water, the change in internal energy, Delta U_water, equals Q, which is equal to Delta U_gas, and this value is 1.14 kilojoules.

The work done, W, is not specified in the equation provided.
