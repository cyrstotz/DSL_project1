Thermodynamic equilibrium when the heat transfer rate, denoted as Q dot, equals zero and the temperature T_gz equals the temperature T_ewg. The gas constant R is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure c_p minus the specific heat at constant volume c_v. During an isentropic process change, the ratio of specific heats kappa, which is c_p divided by c_v, equals 1.262. The temperature T_2 is equal to the initial temperature T_1 multiplied by the ratio of pressure p_2 to pressure p_1 raised to the power of (kappa minus 1) divided by kappa.
