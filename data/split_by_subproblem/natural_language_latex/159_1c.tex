Zero equals the rate of entropy generation plus the rate of heat output divided by the temperature of the cooling fluid minus the rate of heat output divided by the temperature of the reactor.

The rate of entropy generation equals the rate of heat output times the difference between the reciprocal of the reactor temperature and the reciprocal of the cooling fluid temperature, which equals negative 46.9463 per Kelvin.

The rate of heat output is 6.5 kilowatts.

The temperature of the cooling fluid is 295 Kelvin.

The temperature of the reactor is 373.15 Kelvin.
