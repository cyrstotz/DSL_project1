The equations are as follows:

1. Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy of water at the exit and the entropy of water at the entrance, plus the heat transfer rate divided by temperature T, plus the generated entropy rate.

2. Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance, plus the heat transfer rate.

3. The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the entrance and the enthalpy at the exit, which equals the mass flow rate.

4. The entropy of water at the exit is 0.959 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, as referenced from Table A-2.

5. The entropy of water at the entrance is 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, as referenced from Table A-2.

6. The generated entropy rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy of water at the entrance and the entropy of water at the exit, plus the heat transfer rate divided by temperature T, which equals 0.3178 kilojoules per Kelvin.
