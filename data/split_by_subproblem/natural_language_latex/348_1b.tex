b) Average temperature T_m

The equation is:
T equals the integral from s_a to s_e of T ds, divided by s_a minus s_e, which equals q_w divided by s_a minus s_e.

Since water is in the coolant, the following steps are noted:
- q_w equals the change in enthalpy, which leads to (h_a minus h_e) divided by (s_a minus s_e) equals (T_out minus T_in) divided by the natural logarithm of (T_out divided by T_in).
- Regardless of being an ideal fluid,
- The change in enthalpy, Delta h, equals c_p times (T_out minus T_in),
- ss equals c_p times the natural logarithm of (T_out divided by T_in).

The average temperature T_m is 293.12 Kelvin.
