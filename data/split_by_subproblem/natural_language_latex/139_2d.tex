In the calorific system section:

1. The equation is:
   Delta E equals the sum over i of m dot subscript i times the quantity h subscript i plus w subscript i squared over 2, plus Q subscript 13, equals zero, since the volume is the same at the beginning and the end.

2. The equation is:
   Zero equals m dot times the quantity h subscript e minus h subscript a minus the quantity w subscript e squared minus w subscript a squared over 2 plus g times z subscript e minus z subscript a, plus Q dot subscript 13.

3. The equation is:
   Zero equals m dot times the quantity h subscript e minus h subscript a minus the quantity 200 squared minus w subscript a squared over 2, plus Q dot subscript 13.

4. The equation is:
   w subscript a equals the square root of the quantity Q dot subscript 13 over m dot minus the quantity h subscript e minus h subscript a times 2 minus 200 squared.

5. The text states:
   Derivation of T subscript 6.

In the additional section:

The equation is:
   The fraction of the sum over i of e subscript i, real over m subscript gas equals e subscript i, real minus the quantity T subscript 0 times S dot subscript gen over m subscript gas.
