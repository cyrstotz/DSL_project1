The rate of change of entropy, dS/dt, is equal to the mass flow rate, dot m, times the heat input, Q_zu, divided by the temperature, T, plus the sum of the heat, Q_i, divided by the temperature, T_i, minus the generated entropy, S_erzeugt.

Setting the rate of change of entropy, dS/dt, to zero implies that the generated entropy, S_erzeugt, is equal to the sum of the heat, Q_i, divided by the temperature, T_i, which is equal to the difference of the inverse of the high temperature, T_H, minus the inverse of the reference temperature, T_R, times the heat output, Q_aus, which equals 47.56 watts per kelvin.

The generated entropy, S_erzeugt, is 47.56 watts per kelvin.

Graphical Description:
There is a diagram in part (c) that shows a vertical rectangle with a dashed outline. Inside the rectangle, there is an arrow pointing upwards labeled "Q_zu". To the right of the rectangle, there is another arrow pointing upwards labeled "Q_aus". The top of the rectangle is labeled "T_H equals constant equals 200 degrees Celsius equals 373.15 kelvin". The bottom of the rectangle is labeled "T_R equals constant equals 200 degrees Celsius equals 373.15 kelvin". The diagram represents a heat exchange process.
