The equations are as follows:

1. The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3, plus the heat flow rate minus the work flow rate equals zero.
2. The mass flow rate equals the work flow rate divided by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3.
3. The entropy at state 2 equals the entropy at state 3.
4. The entropy at state 3 equals the entropy at state 2, which is 0.9006.
