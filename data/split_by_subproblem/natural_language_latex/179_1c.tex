The rate of entropy generation, denoted as S dot subscript erz, equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference between the entropy at point a, s subscript a, and the entropy at point e, s subscript e, minus the heat transfer rate at point e, Q dot subscript e, divided by the temperature T, plus the heat transfer rate at the outlet, Q dot subscript aus, divided by the temperature T, which equals 4.3 kilowatts per Kelvin.

The entropy at point e, s subscript e, equals 0.5546 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy at point a, s subscript a, equals 1.3065 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The temperature T is 100 degrees Celsius, which is equal to 373 Kelvin.
