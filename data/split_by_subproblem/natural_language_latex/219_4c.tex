The energy efficiency \( E_K \) is equal to the ratio of the heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_K \) to the work rate \( \dot{W}_K \).

From state 1 to state 2, the equation is zero equals the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference in enthalpy from state 1 to state 2 \( (h_1 - h_2) \) plus the heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_K \).
