The pressure \( p_u \) equals \( p_3 \) which is 8 bar. The state u is completely condensed. The enthalpy \( h_4 \) equals \( h_f \) at 8 bar, which is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram. There is a throttle process, so \( h_4 \) equals \( h_1 \), which is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram. The temperature \( T_1 \) is the initial temperature \( T_i \) minus 6 Kelvin.
