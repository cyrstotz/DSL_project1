The rate of change of energy denoted as \( \frac{dE^{\text{ab}}}{dt} \) is equal to the sum of the product of mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_i \) and \( i \), minus the sum of heat flow rate \( \dot{Q} \), minus the sum of \( \dot{\omega}^{\text{ab}} \).

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is equal to the product of mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) and the difference between the enthalpy at entry \( h_{\text{ein},12} \) and the enthalpy at exit \( h_{\text{aus},12} \), minus the heat flow rate \( \dot{Q}_{R,12} \).

The total mass \( m_{\text{tot},12} \) minus the mass \( m_{u,12} \) is equal to the product of mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) and time at entry \( t_{\text{ein},12} \), minus the heat flow rate \( \dot{Q}_{R,12} \).

The product of mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) and \( u_2 \) minus \( m_{u,12} \) is equal to the product of mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) and the enthalpy at entry \( h_{\text{ein},12} \), minus the heat flow rate \( \dot{Q}_{R,12} \).

The product of mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) and \( u_2 \) minus the product of mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) and the enthalpy at entry \( h_{\text{ein},12} \) is equal to the negative of the heat flow rate \( \dot{Q}_{R,12} \) plus the product of \( m_{u,12} \) and \( u_2 \) minus \( m_{u,12} \).

The product of mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) and the difference between \( u_2 \) and the enthalpy at entry \( h_{\text{ein},12} \) is equal to the heat flow rate \( \dot{Q}_{R,12} \) plus the product of \( m_{u,12} \) and \( u_2 \) minus \( m_{u,12} \).

The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is boxed and given as \( 3301.94 \) kilograms.
