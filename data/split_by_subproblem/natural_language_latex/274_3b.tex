T sub g, 2 equals T sub g, 1.

p sub g, 2 minus p sub g, 1 because the mass on the piston has not changed. The volume does not change. The gas is compressed, thus higher pressure but also higher temperature.

T sub g, 2 equals the fraction of p sub g, 2 times V sub g, 2 over m sub g times R.

p times V raised to the power of n equals p prime times V prime raised to the power of n.

(Sachor equals v squared).

V sub 1 equals the fraction of 8 times R times T sub 1 over p times A equals 8 times 10 to the power of negative 4.

V sub 2 equals m sub g times v raised to the power of n equals 3.4 times 10 to the power of negative 3.
