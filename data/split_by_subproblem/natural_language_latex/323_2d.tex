In the given LaTeX content:

- The expression \( e_{x, \text{u,el}} \) is equal to \( T_0: S_{c2} \), which is then canceled out.
- The term \( S_{c2} \) is repeatedly canceled out.
- The equation \( S_{c2} - S_{c1} \) equals \( \frac{q}{T} + S_{c2} \).
- The expression \( \left( S_{c2} - S_{c1} - \frac{q}{T} \right) \) equals \( S_{c2} \).
- The equation \( - q \left( S_{c} - S_{0} \right) - \frac{q_B}{T_B} \) equals \( S_{c2} \), which is numerically given as \( 337.27868 \frac{3}{\text{kg} \cdot K} - 1195 \cdot 10^3 \frac{3}{\text{kg}} \).
