The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled as temperature in Kelvin. The graph displays a cycle with the following points:
- From Point 1 to Point 2: Isentropic process
- From Point 2 to Point 3: Isobaric process
- From Point 3 to Point 4: Isentropic process
- From Point 4 to Point 5: Isobaric process
- From Point 5 to Point 6: Isentropic process
The cycle is illustrated with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
