The diagram is a graph with a horizontal axis labeled s in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and a vertical axis labeled T in Kelvin. There are six points labeled from 1 through 6. Point 1 is located at the bottom left, point 2 is directly above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, point 4 is directly above point 3, point 5 is to the right of point 4, and point 6 is directly below point 5. The path from point 1 to point 6 follows a zigzag pattern with lines connecting the points in the sequence 1-2-3-4-5-6. There are dashed lines extending horizontally from points 2, 3, 4, and 5. These dashed lines are labeled as p2 equals p3, p4, p5, and p6. The line connecting points 1 and 2 is labeled p0 equals p1.
