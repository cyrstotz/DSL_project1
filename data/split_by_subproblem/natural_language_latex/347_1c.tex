The generated entropy, denoted as S_dot_erzeugt, is equal to the expression (1 minus the ratio of T_0 over T) times Q_dot_aus, with T_0 being the environment temperature, which is (100 plus 273.15) Kelvin. However, it is noted that this assumption is not correct as it leads to a negative value, which is impossible.

The generated entropy, S_dot_erzeugt, is calculated as (1 minus the ratio of 373.15 Kelvin over 293.15 Kelvin) times 62.93 kilojoules per second, which equals 4.29 kilojoules per second, assuming T_0 is 293.15 Kelvin.
