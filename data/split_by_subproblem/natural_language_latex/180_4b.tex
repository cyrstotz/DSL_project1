Energy balance:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and enthalpy at state 3, minus the power output of the compressor.
The power output of the compressor divided by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3 equals the mass flow rate, which results in 1.145 kilograms per second.
The high temperature, denoted as T_H, is the sublimation point minus 10 Kelvin, resulting in 263.15 Kelvin.
The enthalpy at state 2 is initially 257.154, which changes to 237.74.
The entropy at state 2 equals the entropy at state 3, resulting in 0.5258.
The enthalpy at state 3 is 257.3, which changes to 0.96.
X equals the difference between the entropy at state 3 and the entropy at the saturated liquid state, divided by the difference between the entropy of the saturated gas and the entropy of the saturated liquid, resulting in 0.96.
