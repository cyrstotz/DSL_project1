Graph Description: The graph is a pressure-volume (p-V) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as T (temperature) and the y-axis is labeled as p (pressure). There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The graph shows a closed loop with the following details:
- From Point 1 to Point 2: A horizontal line labeled "isobar".
- From Point 2 to Point 3: A curved line moving upwards labeled "wet steam region".
- From Point 3 to Point 4: A horizontal line labeled "isobar".
- From Point 4 to Point 1: A curved line moving downwards.
