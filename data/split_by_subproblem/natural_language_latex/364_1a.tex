a) In the System International (SI) units, the First Principle equation is given by zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy plus the kinetic energy term plus the potential energy term, plus the sum of heat added minus the sum of work done.

The heat output \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at point a and the enthalpy at point e.

The heat output rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \) is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet.

The enthalpy at the inlet \( h_{\text{ein}} \) is equal to the enthalpy of water at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 232.88 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at the outlet \( h_{\text{aus}} \) is equal to the enthalpy of water at 100 degrees Celsius plus the mass flow rate times 419.4 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat output rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \) is 37.9 megawatts.
