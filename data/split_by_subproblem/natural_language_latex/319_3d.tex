The change in energy, dE, is zero because water does not perform work, denoted as "Wasser macht keine W" which translates to "Water does no work."

The change in energy, dE, is given by the sum of the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy, half the square of velocity, and gravitational potential energy, plus the sum of heat transfer rate minus the sum of work rate.

The mass times the change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 equals the heat transfer rate, denoted as Q dot.

The pressure at exit condition 2, denoted as p_EW,2, equals the ambient pressure plus the product of density and gravitational acceleration plus half the square of velocity. This results in a pressure of 1.4 bars.

The mass times the sum of the fraction of ice at state 2 times the internal energy of ice at state 2 plus the fraction of water at state 2 times the internal energy of water at state 2 equals the heat transfer rate. This equation is repeated multiple times.
