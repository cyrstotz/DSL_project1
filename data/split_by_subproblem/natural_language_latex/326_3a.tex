The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is equal to the mass \( m_{A,g} \) times the gravitational acceleration \( g \) divided by the area \( A \).

The area \( A \) is equal to 25 square centimeters times pi, which equals 78.5 square centimeters.

The total mass \( m_{ges} \) is equal to 32 kilograms plus 0.1 kilograms (the mass of \( m_{Ew} \)), which totals 32.1 kilograms.

The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) is equal to 1 bar plus the fraction of 32.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 78.5 square centimeters, which equals \( 10^5 \) Pascals plus 40.1 times \( 10^3 \) Pascals, resulting in 1.4 bar.
