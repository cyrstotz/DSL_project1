The rate of heat output, denoted as Q dot subscript aus, equals the mass flow rate of the refrigerant, denoted as m dot subscript TFK, multiplied by the ratio of the entropy change, denoted as S subscript ere, to the temperature of the refrigerant, denoted as T subscript FK.

The entropy change, denoted as S subscript ere, equals negative the ratio of the rate of heat output, denoted as Q dot subscript aus, to the temperature of the refrigerant, denoted as T subscript FK. This is calculated as 62.203 kilowatts divided by 293.12 Kelvin, which equals 0.2122 kilowatts per Kelvin.
