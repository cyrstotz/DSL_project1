The section is titled "c) Steady-state entropy balance:"

The first equation is:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance, plus the heat flow rate out divided by the final temperature, plus the generated entropy rate.

The second equation is:
The generated entropy rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit, plus the heat flow rate out divided by the final temperature, minus the heat flow rate of the refrigerator divided by the outlet temperature.

The third equation is:
The difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit equals the integral from the entrance temperature to the temperature T2 of the specific heat capacity times the reciprocal of the temperature with respect to temperature, which simplifies to the specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T2 to the entrance temperature.

The fourth equation simplifies the expression further:
Equals the specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 298.15 to 288.15.
