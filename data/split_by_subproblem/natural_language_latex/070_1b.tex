The average temperature T-bar is equal to the integral of T ds divided by the difference between s_e1 and s_c, which equals h_q minus h_e divided by s_e1 minus s_c, which equals 126.06 divided by 0.352, resulting in 358.125 Kelvin.

s_e1 is found in Table A-2.

s_e1 equals s_f at 700 degrees Celsius, which is 0.5548 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

s_q equals s_f at 1000 degrees Celsius, which is 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
