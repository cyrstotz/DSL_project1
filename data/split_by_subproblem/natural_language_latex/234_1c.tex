**Sentence in Wall:**
- The heat flow out, Q dot out, at 293.12 Kelvin.
- The heat flow out, Q dot out, at 100 degrees Celsius.

**Entropy Balance for Steady Flow Process:**
- The equation zero equals m dot times (s sub e minus s sub a) plus Q dot out divided by T sub uF plus Q dot out divided by T sub Rücklauf plus S dot generated.
- S dot generated equals Q dot out times (1 divided by T sub uF minus 1 divided by T sub Rücklauf) equals 53.91 Watts per Kelvin.
