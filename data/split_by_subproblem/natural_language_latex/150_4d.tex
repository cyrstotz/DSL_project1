Zero equals the mass flow rate from a to b times the difference in enthalpy between state one and state two plus the heat transfer rate Q_k.

Q_k equals negative mass flow rate from a to b times the difference in enthalpy between state one and state two, which equals 0.0002 times 744.3 kilojoules per hour, resulting in 120.3 watts.

The efficiency epsilon_k equals the absolute value of Q_k divided by the absolute value of work W_A, which equals 4.3.
