The pressure \( P_{g1,2} \) equals \( P_{g1,1} \) which is 1.4 bar, because there has been no additional mass in the state change that needs to counteract \( P_{g1} \) (since the mass and volume are constant).

The temperature \( T \) of ice is also constant because the state of matter changes (at constant pressure \( p \) and temperature \( T \)).

\( T_{g1,2} \)

The temperature \( T \) is given by the formula \( T = \frac{PV}{mRT} \), because the volume \( V \) decreases due to the decrease in temperature \( T \), with the rest remaining constant.
