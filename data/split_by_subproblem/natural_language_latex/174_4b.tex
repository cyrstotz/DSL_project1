The mass flow rate of R134a is denoted as \(\dot{m}_{R134a}\).

The process is a steady flow process involving \(\dot{m}\).

The equation given is zero equals \(\dot{m}\) times the difference of \(h_2\) and \(h_3\) plus \(\dot{Q}\) minus \(\dot{W}\).

The mass flow rate \(\dot{m}\) is equal to the ratio of \(\dot{W}_u\) to the difference of \(h_2\) and \(h_1\), which is also equal to the ratio of \(\dot{W}_u\) to the difference of \(h_2\) and \(h_3\).

The process from state 2 to state 3 is considered.

From Table A-12, at a saturated state, the enthalpy \(h_3\) at 8 bar is 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram.

At another saturated state, the enthalpy \(h_2\) at 23.1 bar is 231.35 kilojoules per kilogram.

The mass flow rate \(\dot{m}\) is given in the solution section as 4 kilograms per hour.
