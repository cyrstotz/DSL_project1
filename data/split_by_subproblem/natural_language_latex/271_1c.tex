The entropy balance of a flow process is given by the equation zero equals m times the difference between s_e and s_a plus the ratio of dot Q_zu over T plus S_erz. 

S_erz is defined as negative m times the difference between s_e and s_a minus the ratio of dot Q_zu over T.

For an ideal fluid, the difference between s_a and s_e is equal to c_p,w times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_2 over T_1.

In the energy balance in the refrigerant mixture, the equation zero equals m times the difference between h_e2 and h_a1 plus dot Q_zu.

m is calculated as negative the ratio of dot Q_zu over the difference between h_e2 and h_e1, which equals the ratio of dot Q_zu over the difference between h_u and h_e.

h_u minus h_e equals c_p,f times the difference between T_g and T_m.

dot m is given by the ratio of dot Q_zu over c_p,f times the difference between T_g and T_m.

S_erz is calculated as negative the product of the ratio of dot Q_zu over c_p,f times the difference between T_g and T_m and c_p,f times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_2 over T_1 minus the ratio of dot Q_zu over T, which simplifies to negative 62.3 Joules per Kelvin.
