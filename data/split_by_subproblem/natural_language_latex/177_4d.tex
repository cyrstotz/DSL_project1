The efficiency epsilon K is equal to the ratio of the heat input dot Q with subscript "zu" over the sum of dot w and l, which is also equal to the ratio of the heat input dot Q with subscript "kalt" over two times dot w. 

The heat input dot Q with subscript "zu" is equal to the product of the mass flow rate dot m and the difference in enthalpy h1 minus h2, plus the heat transfer dot Q with subscript K.

The enthalpy h1 is equal to 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy h2 is equal to the enthalpy at the saturation condition h_f at negative 2 degrees Celsius.
