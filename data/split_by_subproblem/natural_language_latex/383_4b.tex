The mass flow rate of R134a, denoted as m-dot subscript R134a.

Energy balance around the compressor (steady state):
The equation is zero equals m-dot subscript R134a times (h subscript 2 minus h subscript 3) plus zero subscript radial (which is crossed out as it does not contribute) plus W-dot subscript k. This simplifies to m-dot subscript R134a equals W-dot subscript k divided by (h subscript 3 minus h subscript 2).

h subscript 2 equals h subscript f at 22 degrees Celsius, which is 21.77 kilojoules per kilogram.

h subscript 3 equals
