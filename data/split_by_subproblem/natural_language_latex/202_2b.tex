The saturation pressure \( p_s \) is 0.56 bar.

The temperature \( T_5 \) is 371.9 Kelvin.

The specific work \( w_s \) is 270 Joules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at state 5 is equal to the enthalpy at state 6, denoted as \( h_5 = h_6 \).

The change in enthalpy from state 5 to state 6 is given by the integral of \( c_p(T) \) with respect to \( T \) from \( T_5 \) to \( T_6 \), which simplifies to \( c_p \times (T_6 - T_5) \).

The process is adiabatic reversible, which implies it is isentropic.

The entropy at state 5 is equal to the entropy at state 6, denoted as \( s_5 = s_6 \).

The ratio of pressures raised to the power of \((\gamma - 1)/\gamma\) equals the ratio of temperatures, expressed as \( \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}} = \frac{T_6}{T_5} \).

The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated as 85.1 times the pressure ratio raised to the power of 0.286, resulting in 328 Kelvin.

The integral from \( r_5 \) to \( r_6 \) of the expression \(\frac{(w_6^2 - w_5^2)}{2}\) equals zero, which leads to the expression \( \sqrt{2 c_p (T_5 - T_6) + w_6^2 - w_5^2} \).
