The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as S in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin. The plot contains a cycle with six points labeled 0 through 6. The points are connected by lines, with the following details:
- Point 0 is at the origin.
- Point 1 is above point 0.
- Point 2 is to the right of point 1.
- Point 3 is above point 2.
- Point 4 is to the right of point 3.
- Point 5 is below point 4.
- Point 6 is below point 5 and to the right of point 2.

There are annotations indicating "isobar" between points 2 and 3, "isotherm" between points 4 and 5, and "isentrop" between points 5 and 6. The curve between points 0 and 1 is labeled "isobar" and the curve between points 1 and 2 is labeled "isentrop".

The equation is eta sub s equals the fraction (T1 minus T2) over (T1 minus T2) which is less than 1, implying that T2 is greater than T1.
