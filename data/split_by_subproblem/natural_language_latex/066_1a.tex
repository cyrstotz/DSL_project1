Given: mass flow rate (m dot)

Energy conservation in the reactor:
The time derivative of the sum over i of (enthalpy h_i plus half of c_i squared plus half of g times z_i) raised to the power of zero, plus the sum of heat flow Q dot, equals the sum of work rate W dot.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times (in minus out) plus the heat added Q dot subscript "zu" plus the heat of reaction Q dot subscript "R".

The heat added Q dot subscript "zu" equals the mass flow rate times (enthalpy out minus enthalpy in) minus the heat of reaction Q dot subscript "R".

The heat of reaction Q dot subscript "R" is less than zero and the mass flow rate is 3 kilograms per second.

From T&A A-2:
The enthalpy in at 10 degrees Celsius is 42.98 kilojoules per kilogram.
The enthalpy out at 100 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, the heat added Q dot subscript "zu" equals 1375.82 kilowatts.
