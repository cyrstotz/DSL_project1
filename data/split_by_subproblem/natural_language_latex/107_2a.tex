Graph Description: The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled "Entropy S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin" and the y-axis is labeled "Temperature T in Kelvin". The curve starts from a point near the origin, rises steeply, then flattens out slightly before rising steeply again. The curve is drawn in blue.
