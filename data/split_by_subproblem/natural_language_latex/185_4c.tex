c) 

x1 directly after the throttle, Tverd minus Ti minus B times k equals nothing on the right side. 
Ti equals Ti minus 6k.
From state 4 to state 1, the process is adiabatic.

Description:
Graph: A graph with axes labeled T (vertical axis) and P (horizontal axis). There is a rectangular box in the middle of the graph, with a curve starting from the bottom left and curving upwards to the right, passing through the box.

X equals the fraction with numerator S4 minus Sif and denominator Sg minus Sif.

The fraction of m dot over m dot equals zero and the fraction with numerator T4 minus Tc and denominator T4 minus Te equals a constant.
The fraction of m dot over m dot equals the fraction with numerator P4 and denominator P1.

The temperature would be at the same temperature as the cooling medium in equilibrium (T equals Ti minus 6).
Cold cannot be transferred to warm due to the 2 H (word unreadable).
