The content includes a table and some equations:

The table has four columns labeled P, U, and T. The rows are numbered from 0 to 6. The entries in the table are as follows:
- Row 0: P is 0.1 bar, T is -30 degrees Celsius.
- Row 5: P is 0.5 bar, T is 431.5 Kelvin.
- Row 6: P is labeled as p6.

Additionally, there are two items listed:
- \( w_{s\_t} \)
- \( \dot{m} \) equals 220 grams per second.

There are also equations provided:
- \( 2(h_1 - h_3) - w_5^2 = -w_6^2 \)
- \( -208 - \frac{220^2}{2} = -w_6^2 \)
- \( w_6 \) equals 481.67 feet per second.
