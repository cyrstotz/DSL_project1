T1 equals 283.15 Kelvin.
The sublimation temperature is 273.15 Kelvin, which corresponds to T1.
The evaporator temperature is 273.15 Kelvin, which is equal to 0 degrees Celsius.
T2 is 4 degrees Celsius and x2 equals 1.
A10: s3 equals s2 which is 0.8169.
We interpolate in h2 at 8 bar:
h3 equals h1(saturation) plus the fraction of (h at 40 minus h at saturation) over (s at 40 minus s at saturation) times (s3 minus s at saturation), which equals 267.33 kilojoules per kilogram.
The mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, equals Q dot over (h2 minus h3), and m dot equals W dot over (h2 minus h3), and m dot equals 1.57 grams per second.
