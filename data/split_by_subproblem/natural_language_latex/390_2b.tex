1. First law of thermodynamics in the complete wing circle process, no phase change.
2. Zero equals the mass flow rate times the quantity of enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at entry plus half the difference of the square of velocity at exit and the square of velocity at entry, plus the heat added.
3. The specific work equals two times the difference of enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entry plus the square of velocity at exit plus twice the heat added divided by the total mass flow rate.
4. The specific work equals two times the specific heat capacity of air times the difference of temperature at state one and temperature at state zero plus the square of velocity at exit plus twice the heat added divided by the total mass flow rate.
5. The heat added equals the mass flow rate times the heat release per unit mass.
6. The heat release per unit mass equals the heat added divided by the mass flow rate, which equals the heat release per unit mass divided by one plus half the heat release per unit mass.
7. Twice the heat added equals the total mass flow rate times the heat release per unit mass divided by one plus half the heat release per unit mass, which equals the heat release per unit mass divided by one plus half the heat release per unit mass plus twice the heat release per unit mass divided by the total mass flow rate.
8. The difference in enthalpy equals the specific heat capacity of air times the difference in temperature at state q and temperature at state zero.
