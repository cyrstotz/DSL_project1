The temperature \( T_{EL2} \) equals zero degrees Celsius, which is equal to \( T_{EL1} \) and \( T_{g2} \).

The mass \( m_{EL} \) is 0.1 kilograms.

The value \( X_m \) is 0.6.

The heat \( Q_{12} \) is 1500 Joules.

The mass of ice \( m_{Eis} \) is 0.6 minus \( m_{EL} \), which equals 0.06 kilograms.
