The mass flow rate of R134a is denoted by m-dot subscript R134a.

A circular diagram is drawn representing a system with an inlet and an outlet. The inlet is labeled with x equals 1 and an arrow pointing into the system. The outlet is labeled with 8 bar and an arrow pointing out of the system. Inside the circle, the word "isentropic" is written. Below the circle, the value 28 watts is written.

It implies that entropy at state 2 equals entropy at state 3, written as s2 equals s3. Also, s2 equals sg of T2.

Under the heading "1st Law of Thermodynamics for steady flow process:", the equation is written as zero equals m-dot times (h2 minus h3) plus crossed out Q-dot minus W-dot subscript k, indicating an adiabatic process.

The mass flow rate m-dot is calculated as W-dot subscript k divided by (h2 minus h3).

The temperature at state 1, Ts1, is 31.33 degrees Celsius at 8 bar.
