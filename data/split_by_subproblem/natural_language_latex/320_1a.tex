Zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy in and the enthalpy out plus the heat flow rate out.

The heat flow rate out equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy in and the enthalpy out.

This equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 419.94 kilojoules per kilogram and 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

This results in 37.818 kilowatts.
