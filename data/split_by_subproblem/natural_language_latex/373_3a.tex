The mass flow rate m1 is equal to the mass m times the volumetric flow rate V dot 3 divided by the area A, which is further expressed as m cubed times V dot 3 divided by A, multiplied by the density rho and the velocity v.

The area A is equal to pi times the square of the radius, which is half the diameter d, calculated as pi times the square of 7.85 times 10 to the negative 3 meters divided by 2.

This equals 32 kilograms times 9.81 newtons per kilogram divided by 7.85 times 10 to the negative 3 square meters plus 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 newtons per kilogram divided by 7.85 times 10 to the negative 3 square meters plus 1.85 newtons per square meter.

This results in 0.3977 bar plus 1 bar, equaling 1.3977 bar.
