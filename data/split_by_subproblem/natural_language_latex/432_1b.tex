b) The rate of change of entropy, denoted as s-dot, equals the rate of heat transfer, Q-dot, divided by the temperature at the freezing point, T_KF.

The average temperature, T-bar, is given by the integral of temperature T with respect to entropy s from initial entropy s_a to final entropy s_e, divided by the difference s_a minus s_e.

For an ideal fluid, the change in entropy ds equals the specific heat capacity at constant volume for the fluid, c^fl, divided by the temperature T, times the change in temperature dT.

This implies that T times ds equals c^fl times dT. Therefore, the integral of T ds equals c^fl times the difference between the outlet temperature T_aus and the inlet temperature T_ein.

The difference s_a minus s_e equals c^fl times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the outlet temperature T_aus to the inlet temperature T_ein.

Substituting these values, the average temperature T-bar equals the difference between the outlet and inlet temperatures divided by the natural logarithm of the ratio of the outlet to the inlet temperatures. Substituting the values 295.15 Kelvin for T_aus and 258.15 Kelvin for T_ein, the average temperature approximately equals 9.66 Kelvin.
