The graph is described as a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with entropy 's' in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled with temperature 'T' in Kelvin. The graph includes three isobaric lines labeled as 'p2 equals p3', 'p4 equals p5', and 'p0'. There are six points on the graph labeled from 1 to 6. The connections between these points are as follows:
- A vertical line connects Point 1 to Point 2.
- A horizontal line connects Point 2 to Point 3.
- A vertical line connects Point 3 to Point 4.
- A horizontal line connects Point 4 to Point 5.
- A vertical line connects Point 5 to Point 6.
Additionally, the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are connected by dashed lines indicating isobaric processes.
