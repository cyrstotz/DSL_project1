Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state two and enthalpy at state three, plus the heat transfer from state two to state three, minus the work done.

The enthalpy at state three for eight bar and quality equals one is equal to the saturated vapor enthalpy at eight bar, which is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram, and there is a change in temperature.

The quality at state three equals one because it is isentropically compressed.

The entropy at state three for fluid equals the entropy at state two for fluid, which is 0.3845 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, because it is isentropic.

The enthalpy at state two is not provided.
