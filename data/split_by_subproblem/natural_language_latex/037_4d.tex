The kinetic energy, E_K, is equal to the absolute value of Q_m dot divided by the absolute value of V_K dot, which is also equal to the absolute value of Q_1 dot divided by the absolute value of V_K dot.

Q_K dot is equal to Q_x dot.

Zero equals the product of m_R134a dot and the difference between h_1 and h_2, plus Q_x dot. This implies that Q_x dot equals the product of m dot and the difference between h_2 and h_1.
