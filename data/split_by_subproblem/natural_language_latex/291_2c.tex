The change in specific exergy due to the stream, denoted as Delta e_x,str, is equal to e_x,str6 minus e_x,str0.

Delta e_x,str is given by the expression in square brackets: h_a minus h_e minus T_0 times (s_a minus s_e) plus Delta ke plus Delta pe.

This simplifies to h_s minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_0 minus s_0) plus the difference of omega_2 squared minus omega_0 squared, all divided by 2.

Further simplifying, it equals c_p times k times (T_0 minus T_0) minus T_0 times the quantity c_p times the natural logarithm of (T_0 divided by T_0) minus R times the natural logarithm of (p_0 divided by p_0), all added to the difference of omega_2 squared minus omega_0 squared, divided by 2.

Finally, Delta e_x,str equals negative 26019.4 kilojoules per kilogram.
