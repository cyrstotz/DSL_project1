The change in entropy for the second process, denoted as Delta S_u2, is equal to the absolute value of the change in mass for the second process, Delta m_u2, multiplied by the difference in entropy between state 2 and state 1. This value is 1376.28 kilojoules per kilogram.

The entropy at state 2, denoted as s_2, equals the entropy of saturated vapor at 20 degrees Celsius, which is 0.9598 kilojoules per kilogram.

The entropy at state 1, denoted as s_1, is calculated as x times the entropy of saturated vapor at 100 degrees Celsius plus (1 minus x) times the entropy of saturated liquid at 100 degrees Celsius.

The change in mass for the second process, denoted as Delta m_u2, is 360.6 kilojoules per kilogram.

The entropy at state 1, s_1, is given as 1.3372 kilojoules per kilogram, according to Table A2.
