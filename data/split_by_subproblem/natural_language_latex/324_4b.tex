The equations and expressions provided are as follows:

1. Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and enthalpy at state 3, minus the power output of the compressor.
2. The mass flow rate equals the power output of the compressor divided by the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and enthalpy at state 3.
3. The power output of the compressor is 25 watts.
4. The enthalpy at state 2 for a temperature of 6 Kelvin and quality (x) equals 1 is not specified.
5. The enthalpy at state 3 for a temperature of 6 Kelvin and some unspecified condition (delta ba) is not specified.
6. The temperature at state 3, but at a different condition, 5.5 times 6 Kelvin, is mentioned without further details.
