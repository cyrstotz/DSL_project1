The value of h subscript 4 equals h subscript A, which is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram. The value of p subscript 2 equals p subscript A, which is 1.2182 bar. Therefore, x subscript A equals the fraction where the numerator is h subscript 4 minus h subscript f of p subscript 4, and the denominator is h subscript g of p subscript 4 minus h subscript f of p subscript 4, which equals 0.3375.
