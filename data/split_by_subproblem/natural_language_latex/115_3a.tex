X equals 70.
The pressure of water, denoted as P_Wasser, equals 139 times 969.54 Pascal.

The pressure will be the same since the height is the same from the water inlet.

The temperature of the gas will correspond to the temperature of the water inlet, as in thermodynamic equilibrium temperatures are equal.

The saturation temperature at 7.400 bar is 0.000 degrees Celsius, which equals T_a,2 minus T_em,2.
The difference in pressure between P_g,2 and P_g,1 equals negative 700 times 694.04 Pascal.
