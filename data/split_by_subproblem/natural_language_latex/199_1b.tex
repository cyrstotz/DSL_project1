The average temperature, denoted as T-bar, is calculated as follows:
- It is equal to the integral from s1 to s2 of T ds, divided by s2 minus s1, where ds equals dQ over T.
- This simplifies to the integral from s1 to s2 of dQ over T, divided by s2 minus s1.
- Which further simplifies to Delta Q divided by the natural logarithm of T2 over T1.
- This can be expressed as T2 minus T1 divided by the natural logarithm of T2 over T1.
- Substituting the values, it becomes 298.15 Kelvin minus 258.15 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of 298.15 Kelvin over 258.15 Kelvin.
- The final result is 283.12 Kelvin.
