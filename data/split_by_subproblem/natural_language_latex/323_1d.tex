1. Heat Sink Reactor:

Zero equals the mass flow rate from state 1 to 2 times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry, plus the heat transfer rate out from state 1 to 2.

The enthalpy at exit, denoted as h_e, equals the enthalpy of vaporization, h_g, at 20 degrees Celsius from Table 4-2, which is 2538 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at entry, denoted as h_a, equals the enthalpy of fluid, h_f, at 100 degrees Celsius from Table 4-2, which is 419 kilojoules per kilogram.

The mass flow rate from state 1 to 2 is calculated as the heat transfer rate out from state 1 to 2 divided by the difference between the enthalpy at entry and the enthalpy at exit. This is equal to 35 times 10 to the power of 6 kilojoules per second divided by the difference between 2676.1 and 2538.9 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in 0.255 times 10 kilograms per second.
