- q sub Eis comma 2 is greater than zero.
- When energy as heat flows more (implies T sub gg equals T sub Ew), then for ideal/perfect gases, the internal energy depends only on the temperature.
- The internal energy of Ew and gg minus the internal energy at T sub 1 equals m times c sub v.
- Proceed with T sub g comma 2 equals 0.003 degrees Celsius.
