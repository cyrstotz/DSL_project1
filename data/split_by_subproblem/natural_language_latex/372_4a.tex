Graph 1: The graph is a plot of pressure in bars versus temperature in Kelvin. The curve starts at the bottom left, oscillates upwards and downwards several times, and ends at the bottom right. The points are labeled as follows:
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.
- Point 2 is slightly higher and to the right of Point 1.
- Point 3 is higher and to the right of Point 2.
- Point 4 is higher and to the right of Point 3.
- Point 5 is higher and to the right of Point 4.
- Point 6 is higher and to the right of Point 5.
The curve is labeled with "liquid", "wet steam", and "steam" at different sections.

Graph 2: The graph is a plot of pressure in bars versus temperature in Kelvin. The curve starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls back down. The points are labeled as follows:
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.
- Point 2 is higher and to the right of Point 1.
- Point 3 is higher and to the right of Point 2.
- Point 4 is at the peak, higher and to the right of Point 3.
