b) The pressure in the gas remains the same, since the same amount of weight is still pressing on top.

The pressure \( p_{s2} \) equals \( p_{s1} \) which is 1.4009 bar.

The temperature \( T_{g2} \) equals the equilibrium temperature \( T_{EW,2} \) indicating a phase equilibrium.

Since there is still ice present, the water remains in the two-phase region and thus at a constant temperature. The pressure has not changed, so the temperature in the water remains constant at 0 degrees Celsius. Since we are in equilibrium, the temperature \( T_{g2} \) equals the equilibrium temperature \( T_{EW,2} \) which is 0 degrees Celsius.
