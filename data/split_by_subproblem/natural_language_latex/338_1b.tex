T equals the integral from s_a to s_e of T dS divided by the difference s_a minus s_e equals h.

T equals the integral from s_a to s_e of T dS divided by the difference s_a minus s_e equals the difference h_a minus h_e divided by the difference s_a minus s_e.

Since it is a reversible stationary process,

h_in minus h_out equals c_if times the difference T_in minus T_out plus v_if times the difference p_in minus p_out.
