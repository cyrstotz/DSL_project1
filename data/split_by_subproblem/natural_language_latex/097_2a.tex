Graph Description:
The graph is a T-s diagram with temperature T on the vertical axis and entropy s on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled T with the unit [K] (Kelvin). The horizontal axis is labeled s with the unit [kJ/(kgÂ·K)] (kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin). The graph contains several points and lines connecting these points, representing different states and processes. The points are labeled as follows:
- Point 1 at the bottom left corner, labeled P_e.
- Point 2 above and to the right of Point 1.
- Point 3 above and to the right of Point 2.
- Point 4 above and to the right of Point 3.
- Point 5 to the right of Point 4.
- Point 6 below and to the right of Point 5.

The lines connecting these points are labeled with different processes:
- Line from Point 1 to Point 2 is labeled s = const (entropy is constant).
- Line from Point 2 to Point 3 is labeled p = const (pressure is constant).
- Line from Point 3 to Point 4 is labeled T = const (temperature is constant).
- Line from Point 4 to Point 5 is labeled s = const (entropy is constant).
- Line from Point 5 to Point 6 is labeled s = const (entropy is constant).

The graph also includes several horizontal dashed lines indicating specific temperature values:
- A line at 128.9K.
- A line at 431.9K.
- A line ranging from -30 degrees to 243.15K.

Additionally, there is a note at the bottom of the graph stating "Air ideal gas" and "no shock".
