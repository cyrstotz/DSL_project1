The rate of entropy change, S dot, equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference between the entropy at the inlet, s subscript ein, and the entropy at the outlet, s subscript aus, plus the rate of heat transfer at the outlet, Q dot subscript aus, divided by the temperature, T.

The temperature, T, equals the difference between the temperature at the outlet for a, T subscript a,aus, and the temperature at the outlet for e, T subscript e,aus, divided by the difference between the entropy for a, s subscript a, and the entropy for e, s subscript e.

The difference between the entropy for a, s subscript a, and the entropy for e, s subscript e, equals the specific heat at constant pressure for the mixture, c subscript p,m, times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the temperature for a, T subscript a, to the temperature for e, T subscript e.

Zero equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference between the enthalpy for e, h subscript e, and the enthalpy for a, h subscript a, plus the rate of heat transfer at the outlet, Q dot subscript aus.

The rate of heat transfer, Q dot, equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the specific heat at constant pressure for the mixture, c subscript p,m, times the change in temperature, Delta T, plus the rate of heat transfer at the outlet, Q dot subscript aus.

The change in temperature, Delta T, is approximately negative 10 Kelvin.

The rate of entropy change, S dot, equals the integral of the rate of heat transfer, Q dot, divided by the temperature, T, with respect to entropy, ds.

The rate of entropy change, S dot, equals the rate of heat transfer, Q dot, divided by the difference between the entropy for a, s subscript a, and the entropy for e, s subscript e.
