The mass flow rate, m dot, equals the generated mass flow rate, m dot gen.

Zero equals m dot times the difference between h2 and h3 plus the power of the compressor, W dot K, where m dot equals 0.827 kilograms per hour.

h2 equals h at x2 equals 1.

h3 equals h at 8 corrected s2.

The initial temperature, T i, is reduced by 6 Kelvin and the pressure p2 equals p4.

h equals 237.94.

s equals 0.928.
