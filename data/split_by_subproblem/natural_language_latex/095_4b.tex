Energy flow at the compressor:

Q equals the mass flow rate of Carnot (m dot subscript Carnot) times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet (h subscript ein) and the enthalpy at the outlet (h subscript aus) minus the power dot W subscript k.

Power dot W subscript k equals the mass flow rate of Carnot (m dot subscript Carnot) times the difference between h2 and h3.

The mass flow rate of Carnot (m dot subscript Carnot) equals the power dot W subscript k divided by the difference between h2 and h3.

h2 (saturated vapor) delta h

h3 (3 bar) delta h

h3 (saturated liquid) delta h equals 264.16 kilojoules per kilogram

Pressure level: 1 bar
