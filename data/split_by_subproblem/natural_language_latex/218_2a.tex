The following points and conditions are listed:

- Point 0 at zero, 0.191 bar, negative 30 degrees Celsius.
- Point 1.
- Point 2, where the pressure p2 equals p3.
- Point 3, where the pressure p5 equals p2.
- Point 4.
- Point 5 at 0.5 bar, 431.9 Kelvin.
- Point 6 at 0.191 bar.

Additionally, the equalities between entropies are given as:
- The entropy s1 equals s2.
- The entropy s2 equals s1.

Graphical Description:

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled S with units kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin. The y-axis is labeled T in Kelvin.

Points are marked as follows:
- Point 0 at the origin.
- Point 1 slightly to the right of Point 0.
- Point 2 above Point 1.
- Point 3 to the right of Point 2.
- Point 4 below Point 3.
- Point 5 to the right of Point 4.
- Point 6 below Point 5 and to the right of Point 2.

The lines connecting the points form a closed loop with the following connections:
- Line from Point 0 to Point 2.
- Line from Point 2 to Point 3.
- Line from Point 3 to Point 4.
- Line from Point 4 to Point 5.
- Line from Point 5 to Point 6.
- Line from Point 6 back to Point 0.
