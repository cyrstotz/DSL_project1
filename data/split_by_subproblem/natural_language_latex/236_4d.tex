The equation E_c equals the ratio of dot Q subscript zul over the absolute value of dot W subscript t, which equals the ratio of dot Q subscript zul over the absolute value of dot Q subscript ab minus dot Q subscript zul, which equals the ratio of dot Q subscript Z1 over dot Q subscript ab.

The equation E_c equals the absolute value of the ratio of dot Q subscript k over dot W subscript k, which equals the product of dot m subscript R134a and the difference h_2 minus h_1, all over 28 watts.

Energy balance for the evaporator: zero equals the product of dot m and the difference h_1 minus h_2 plus dot Q subscript c.

The equation dot Q subscript c equals the product of dot m and the difference h_2 minus h_1.
