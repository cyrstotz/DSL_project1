b) w_6, i_6

Equation:
The derivative with respect to time of the mass flow rate times the sum of h_5 and half of v_5 squared equals the mass flow rate times the sum of h_6 and half of v_6 squared.

(Possibly Ideal Gas)
The specific heat at constant pressure times the sum of temperatures T_5 and T_6 equals half the difference between v_5 squared and w_6 squared.

The ratio of temperature T_6 to T_5 equals the ratio of pressure p_6 to p_5 raised to the power of (n-1) divided by n.

Therefore, T_6 equals T_5 times the ratio of pressure p_6 to p_5 raised to the power of (n-1) divided by n.

Therefore, T_6 equals 493.15 times the ratio of 0.184 to 0.5 raised to the power of (1.4-1) divided by 1.4.

This equals 328.1 Kelvin.

w_6 equals the square root of two times the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference between T_5 and T_6 plus v_5 squared.

w_6 equals the square root of two times 1.006 times the difference between 493.15 and 328.1 plus v_5 squared.

This equals 507.2 meters per second.

E_b

The equation for e_k, str is equal to the modified h_1 minus h_0 minus the modified r_0 times the difference between s_i and s_0 times tke.

This equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference between modified T_1 and T_0 minus the modified r_0 times the specific heat at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of modified T_1 to T_0 minus the gas constant times the natural logarithm of the ratio of modified p_1 to p_0 plus half the square of modified v.
