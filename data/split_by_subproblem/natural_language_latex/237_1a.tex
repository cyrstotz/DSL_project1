Subsection a) stationary without ke$\delta$pe

The equations are as follows:
1. Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat transfer rate into the system, plus the heat transfer rate out of the system.
2. The heat transfer rate out of the system equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet, minus the heat transfer rate into the system.
3. The heat transfer rate out of the system equals 2.69 kilowatts minus 123.04 kilowatts.
