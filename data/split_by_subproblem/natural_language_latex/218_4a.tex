Graph 1: The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (p-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled T and the y-axis is labeled p. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is directly above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, and point 4 is directly below point 3. The region between points 1, 2, 3, and 4 is shaded. There is a line connecting points 1 and 4, and another line connecting points 2 and 3. The point labeled "Triple" is to the right of point 3.

Graph 2: The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (p-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled T and the y-axis is labeled p. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 forming a square. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is directly above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, and point 4 is directly below point 3. The point labeled "Triple" is to the right of point 3.

The temperature T_i is 5 degrees Celsius.

The equations are as follows:
1. p_2 equals p_1.
2. p_2 equals p_1.
3. The pressure is 8 bar.
4. The pressure is 6 bar.

x_2 equals 1.

w equals 28 w.

x equals 0.
