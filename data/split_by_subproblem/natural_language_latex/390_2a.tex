The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as temperature in degrees Celsius. The x-axis starts at negative 30 degrees Celsius. There are six points labeled from 0 to 6. These points are connected by curves and lines, forming a cycle. The points are connected in the sequence: from 0 to 1, from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, from 3 to 4, from 4 to 5, and from 5 to 6. The curve from point 0 to 1 is labeled with a pressure of 0.191 bar. The curve from point 1 to 2 is labeled as p2, p1. The curve from point 2 to 3 is labeled as p3, p4. The curve from point 3 to 4 is labeled as p4, p5. The curve from point 4 to 5 is labeled as p5, p6. The curve from point 5 to 6 is labeled as p6, p7. The points are connected by the following processes: from 0 to 1 by adiabatic compression, from 1 to 2 by adiabatic compression with an isentropic efficiency less than 1, from 2 to 3 by adiabatic compression, from 3 to 4 by isothermal heat addition, from 4 to 5 by adiabatic expansion, and from 5 to 6 by adiabatic expansion with an isentropic efficiency less than 1.
