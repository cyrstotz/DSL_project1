I assume a mass flow rate of 4 kilograms per hour for safety, which equals 4 over 3600 kilograms per second.

The equation zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy h1 and h2 plus the heat transfer rate to the environment. Rearranging gives negative heat transfer rate over mass flow rate plus h2 equals h1.

The enthalpy h3 equals 271.3 kilojoules per kilogram.

From state 3 to state 4, assuming isochoric process at 2 specific volumes, the pressure is 8 bar, quality x equals 0, and enthalpy h4 equals the enthalpy at fluid state at 8 bar.

The enthalpy h4 equals 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

The equation mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy h3 and h4 plus the heat transfer rate equals zero. Solving for Q gives 0.198 kilowatts.

Due to the cycle process, the work plus the energy leaving equals zero.

In another equation, negative 28W plus negative 197.6W plus the heat transfer rate equals zero, solving for the heat transfer rate gives 225.6 watts.

The equation mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy h1 and h2 plus the heat transfer rate equals zero. Solving for h1 gives negative heat transfer rate over mass flow rate plus h2.
