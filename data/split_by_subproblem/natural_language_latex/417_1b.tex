The effective temperature, denoted as T_{wir}, is calculated as the integral of T times ds from s_1 to s_2, divided by the difference s_2 minus s_1.

The effective temperature when the system is on, T_{wir, am}, is 15 degrees Celsius.

The effective temperature when the system is off, T_{wir, aus}, is 25 degrees Celsius.

The value of s_2 at 285.15 Kelvin, which corresponds to the start time (AZ), is equal to s at 15 degrees Celsius, which is 0.2245 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The value of s_2 at 298 Kelvin, which corresponds to the start time (AZ), is equal to s at 25 degrees Celsius, which is 0.36494 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

For section 1.C, the equation given is zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between se and sa, plus the sum of heat flow rates denoted by Q_j, plus the generated entropy rate, denoted by S_gen.

The generated entropy rate, S_gen, is equal to the negative of the mass flow rate times the difference between se and sa, minus the heat flow rate from the oven divided by the reference temperature, T_ref.
