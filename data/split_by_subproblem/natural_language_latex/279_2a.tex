The graph described is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with entropy in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled with temperature in Kelvin. The graph features a curve that starts at point 0 and moves upwards to point 3, then downwards to point 6. The points are labeled sequentially from 0 to 6. The segments between points 0 to 1, 2 to 3, and 4 to 5 are vertical lines indicating processes at constant volume, known as isochoric processes. The segments between points 1 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 to 6 are inclined lines indicating processes at constant pressure, known as isobaric processes. The points are connected in the order: 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6. The terms "isochore" and "isobare" are noted next to the respective segments indicating constant volume and constant pressure processes respectively.
