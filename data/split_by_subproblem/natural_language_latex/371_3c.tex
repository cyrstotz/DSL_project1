Section c) Continue with \( T_{gr2} = 0.003^\circ C \)

**Sought:** \( Q_{12} \)

**Given State:** \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} \)

The change in energy \( \Delta E \) is equal to the change in internal energy \( \Delta U \), which is calculated as the mass \( m \) times the gravitational acceleration \( g \) times the difference in specific internal energy \( u_2 - u_1 \):

\[
\Delta E = \Delta U = m g (u_2 - u_1)
\]

The difference in specific internal energy \( u_2 - u_1 \) is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure for liquid-gas \( c_p^{lg} \) times the difference in temperatures \( T_{gr2} - T_{gr1} \):

\[
u_2 - u_1 = c_p^{lg} (T_{gr2} - T_{gr1})
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
= 0.633 \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \cdot (0.003^\circ C \cdot 273.153 K - 773.153 K)
\]

This results in:

\[
= -346.50 \frac{kJ}{kg}
\]

Thus, the change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is the mass \( m \) times 0.00342 kg times -346.50 kJ/kg:

\[
\Delta U = m \cdot 0.00342 \, kg \cdot (-346.50 \frac{kJ}{kg}) = -1.08 \, kJ
\]

Therefore, the heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is:

\[
\Rightarrow Q_{12} = -1.08 \, kJ
\]
