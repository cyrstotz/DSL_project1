The TRF (Temperature Reduction Factor) is given by the formula:
TRF equals the integral from s_a to s_e of T ds, all over the difference s_a minus s_e.

The equation is:
zero equals m dot times the difference s_e minus s_a plus the sum of Q dot j over T_j plus s dot rez.

The Lorenz equation is stated as:
s_a minus s_e equals the integral from T_1 to T_2 of c_if of T over T dT, where p is constant equals n equals Q dot.

It leads to the conclusion that:
TRF equals 295 Kelvin.
