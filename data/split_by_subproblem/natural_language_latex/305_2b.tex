h five plus w five squared over two equals h six plus w six squared over two.

The nozzle is isentropic implies s five equals s six implies n equals k equals 1.4.

T six equals T five times the quantity p six over p five raised to the power of (k minus one) over k equals 431.9 Kelvin times the quantity 0.191 over 0.5 raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 equals underlined 328.07 Kelvin.

Implies w six squared over two equals h five minus h six plus w five squared over two.

Equals c p times the quantity T five minus T six plus w five squared over two equals 1.005 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the quantity 431.9 minus 328.07 Kelvin plus the quantity 220 meters per second squared over two.

Equals 104.45 kilojoules plus 24.2 kilojoules equals 128.65 kilojoules.

Implies w six equals the square root of two times 128.65 kilojoules equals underlined 507.24 meters per second.
