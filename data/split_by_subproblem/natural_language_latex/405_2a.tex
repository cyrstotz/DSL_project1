The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled as T(K) and the horizontal axis is labeled as s (Joules per kilogram Kelvin). The graph consists of several points and lines connecting them:
- Point O is at the origin.
- A curved line goes from point O upwards to point 1.
- A straight line goes from point 1 upwards to point P2.
- A straight line goes from point P2 downwards to point G.
- A straight line goes from point G downwards to point S.
- A straight line goes from point S downwards to point 6.
- A straight line goes from point 6 downwards to point P0.

For task 2, part a:
- The change in specific internal energy due to radiation, denoted as delta e subscript nu, str, equals 100 times the ratio of t3 over t23 (from the given data).
- The solar energy, denoted as e subscript x, sol, equals T0 times s_err.
