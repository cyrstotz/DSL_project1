The total mass flow rate, denoted as m-dot-sub-ges, equals the density rho times the area A times the velocity w.

The density rho is equal to one divided by the specific volume v.

Zero equals the total mass flow rate m-dot-sub-ges times the quantity (omega-e squared minus omega-a squared) divided by two, minus the work W-sub-t.

The work W-sub-t equals the mass flow rate m-dot times the integral from 1 to 2 of v dp.

The exit velocity omega-e is 220 meters per second.

This implies that the velocity omega-a, which is equal to omega-6, is 500 meters per second.

The temperature T-sub-6 is 240 Kelvin.
