The molecular weight \( M_g \) is 50 kilograms per kilomole.

The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as \( R = \frac{\overline{R}}{M_g} \) which equals 166.28 Joules per mole.

The expression \( 50 \times 10^{-3} \) kilograms per mole is given.

The ideal gas law is represented by \( pV = RT \).

The volume per mass \( \frac{V}{m} \) is equal to \( V \), which implies \( V = V \times m \).

The ratio of moles to mass \( \frac{n}{m} \) is equal to \( \frac{M}{m} \).
