The graph described is a pressure-temperature diagram, where the vertical axis represents pressure denoted as 'p' and the horizontal axis represents temperature denoted as 'T'. There are three points labeled as 1, 2, and 3 on the graph. Point 1 is located at the top right, point 2 is directly below point 1, and point 3 is to the left of point 2. The line connecting point 1 to point 2 is vertical, which indicates a process at constant temperature. The line connecting point 2 to point 3 is horizontal, which indicates a process at constant pressure. The pressure at point 3 is labeled as 'p_Tripel' and 'p_prop equals 5 bar'.
