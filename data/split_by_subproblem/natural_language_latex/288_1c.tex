ASSUMPTION: The average temperature, T_KF, is 295 K.

The equation is zero equals negative the rate of heat output divided by the temperature of Reservoir 1 plus the rate of heat output divided by the average temperature T_KF plus the generated entropy rate.

The generated entropy rate equals the rate of heat output divided by the temperature of Reservoir 1 minus the rate of heat output divided by the average temperature T_KF, which equals negative 62.18 divided by 373.15 minus negative 62.18 divided by 295, resulting in 0.044 kilowatts per Kelvin.

Graphical Description:
There is a vertical rectangular box labeled "WALL" with an arrow pointing to the left side of the box labeled with the rate of heat output and another arrow pointing to the right side of the box also labeled with the rate of heat output.
