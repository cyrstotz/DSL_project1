The graph is described as a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with entropy in units of kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled with temperature in Kelvin. There are three isobars marked as p0 equals p6, p4 equals p5, and p2 equals p3. The graph illustrates a cycle with points labeled from 1 to 6. The cycle begins at point 1, progresses to point 2, then to point 3, moves to point 4, then to point 5, and finally to point 6, which connects back to point 1.
