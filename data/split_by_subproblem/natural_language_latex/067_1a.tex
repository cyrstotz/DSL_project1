Subsection a) Energy Balance (Flow Process):
The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat transfer out of the system. This can be written as:
\[ 0 = \dot{m} [ h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}} ] + Q_{\text{out}} \]

It implies that the heat transfer out of the system is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet, which is further equal to the mass flow rate times the specific heat capacity at constant pressure times the difference in temperature from the outlet to the inlet of the low friction process, multiplied by the ratio of pressure over the difference in two pressures. This can be expressed as:
\[ Q_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} [ h_{\text{out}} - h_{\text{in}} ] = \dot{m} \cdot c_p ( T_{\text{LF, out}} - T_{\text{LF, in}} ) \cdot \frac{p}{( p_2 - p_1 )} \]
