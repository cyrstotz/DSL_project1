c) Throttle (isenthalpic and adiabatic)

The enthalpy at the upstream side equals the enthalpy at state 1:
\[ h_u = h_1 \]

The enthalpy at state x2 is given by the formula:
\[ h_{x2} = h_f + x_{x2} (h_g - h_f) \]

The isentropic efficiency is calculated as:
\[ \eta_{is} = \frac{h_2}{h_{is}} \quad \text{(State 2 in two-phase region with } T_2 = -22^\circ C) \]

The pressure at state 2 is:
\[ p_2 = 1.2192 \text{ bar} \]

The values of enthalpy for liquid and gas are:
\[ h_f = 211.77 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \quad h_g = 234.08 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \]

Therefore, the quality at state x2 equals the quality at state 1:
\[ \Rightarrow x_{x2} = x_1 = \]
