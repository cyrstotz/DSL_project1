The equations provided are as follows:

1. The product of mass flow rate (denoted as m-dot) and the change in temperature (Delta T subscript m2) equals 0.003 degrees Celsius.

2. The rate of change of energy (dE/dt) equals the change in internal energy (Delta U), which is equal to the product of energy flow rate (E-dot) and heat transfer (Q) minus the product of the flow rate of exergy destruction (xi-dot) and work (W).

3. The work (W) is equal to the product of mass density (rho subscript m) and the difference in volume (V2 minus V1), which equals 740 kilojoules per cubic meter times the difference (3.74 minus 7.89) times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.

4. The heat transfer (Q) is equal to the product of mass flow rate (m-dot), specific heat at constant volume (c subscript v), and the temperature difference (T2 minus T1). The equation is left incomplete.
