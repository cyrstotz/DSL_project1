The graph described is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with T for Temperature and the y-axis is labeled with P for Pressure. It features a curve that starts from the bottom left, rises steeply, and then levels off towards the right. This curve is marked with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is located at the bottom left, point 2 is slightly above and to the right of point 1, point 3 is further to the right and slightly above point 2, and point 4 is positioned far to the right. The area to the left of the curve is labeled as "liquid," and the area to the right of the curve is labeled as "gas." Additionally, there is a horizontal line that extends from point 3 to the right, which is labeled "10K" and "3.1 mbar."
