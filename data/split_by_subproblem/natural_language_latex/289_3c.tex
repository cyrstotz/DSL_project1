Q12 equals Q dot.

The energy balance yields:

The derivative of E with respect to t equals Q dot i minus Q dot v, which implies that the change in E equals the change in U equals Q12.

The change in U equals m2 times u2 minus m1 times u1, which equals mg times (u2 minus u1), which equals Q dot 12.

mg times cv times (Tg3 minus Tg1) equals Q12 equals negative 1083.06 Joules.
