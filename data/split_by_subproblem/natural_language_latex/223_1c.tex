c) Energy balance around a reactor with steady-state fluid and a mass flow

The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the entropy in and the entropy out, plus the heat flow rate into the reactor divided by the temperature, minus the heat flow rate out of the reactor divided by the temperature, plus the generated entropy rate.

The generated entropy rate equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the entropy out and the entropy in, minus the heat flow rate into the reactor divided by the temperature, plus the heat flow rate out of the reactor divided by the temperature.

The generated entropy rate equals 0.5 kilograms per second times the difference between 7.5549 and 7.1553 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, minus 100 kilojoules per second divided by 255 Kelvin, plus 76.96 kilojoules per second divided by 298 Kelvin.

The entropy in, denoted as s at 70 degrees Celsius, equals 7.1553 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy out, denoted as s at 100 degrees Celsius, equals 7.5549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The negative generated entropy rate equals negative 0.2015 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
