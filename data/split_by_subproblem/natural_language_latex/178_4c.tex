The mass flow rate, denoted as m-dot, is given by the derivative with respect to time of the expression (h - h_f) divided by (h_g - h_f).

x is defined as (h - h_f) divided by (h_g - h_f).

The initial conditions are: pressure p1 equals 8 bar, x1 equals 0, and temperature T equals 31.33 degrees Celsius.

The cycle is isothermal.

The derivative with respect to time of the expression (h - h_f) divided by (h_g - h_f) equals zero.

h_q is equal to h_1.

h_q equals h_f at 8 bar, as found in Table A-11.

This equals 55.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

m-dot is mentioned but not defined further here.

x is calculated as (h_4 - h_f at 4 degrees Celsius) divided by (h_g at 4 degrees Celsius - h_f at 4 degrees Celsius).

This results in (55.42 - 55.35) divided by (243.53 - 55.35).

Which equals 0.196.

The triple point temperature T_tripel is 0 degrees Celsius.

The initial temperature T_i is 0 degrees Celsius plus 10, leading to -10 degrees Celsius.

The temperature T_1 is 4 degrees Celsius.

Reference is made to Table A-10.
