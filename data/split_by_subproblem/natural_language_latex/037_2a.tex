Graph Description:

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled T in units of K (Kelvin) and the horizontal axis labeled s in units of kJ/kgÂ·K (kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).

There are three isobaric lines labeled as follows:
- The topmost isobar is labeled "isobar at p3 equals 0.5 bar".
- The middle isobar is labeled "isobar at p2".
- The bottom isobar is labeled "isobar at p0 equals 0.797 bar".

The graph contains six points labeled 0 through 6, connected by arrows indicating the direction of processes:
- Point 0 is at the bottom left.
- Point 1 is above and to the right of point 0.
- Point 2 is above and to the right of point 1, on the middle isobar.
- Point 3 is above and to the right of point 2, on the top isobar.
- Point 4 is to the right of point 3, connected by a dashed line.
- Point 5 is below point 4, on the middle isobar.
- Point 6 is below point 5, on the bottom isobar.
