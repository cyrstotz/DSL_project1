The mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, is stationary. The kinetic energy rate, W_k dot, equals 28 Watts. The heat transfer rate, Q, is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between the exit and the approach (h_e minus h_a) times the product of time and length minus the kinetic energy rate, W_k dot. The kinetic energy rate, W_k dot, equals 28 Watts, which is also equal to the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between states 2 and 3 (h_2 minus h_3). The enthalpy at the exit, h_e, corresponds to x_2 equals unknown, and it is in a saturated dampened state. The enthalpy at the approach, h_a, is given. The pressure at the approach, p, equals 3 bar, which implies that the enthalpy is resorbable, with os equals 0 and the entropy at state 2 equals the entropy at state 3, s_2 equals s_3. The pressure at state 3, p_3, is the maximum pressure, p_max. The pressure at state 4, p_4, is the pressure before, p_vor, and corresponds to x_e. The enthalpy at state 4, h_4, equals 93.62 kilojoules per kilogram. The enthalpy at state 1, h_1, equals the enthalpy at the exit, h_e, and the enthalpy at state 2 is not specified. The dry steam condition is given, with the temperature of the wall, T_w, equals negative 4 degrees Celsius, and the temperature at the exit, T_e, also equals negative 4 degrees Celsius.
