The heat output, denoted as Q_aus, is to be determined. The equation for Q is given by the mass flow rate, denoted as dot m, times the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, denoted as c_m, times the difference between the enthalpy at inlet, denoted as h_ein, and the enthalpy at outlet, denoted as h_aus. Two terms involving integrals and differences in pressure are crossed out, indicating they are not considered in this calculation.

The expression for Q_aus is given by the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at outlet and the enthalpy at inlet. Additional terms involving integrals and pressure differences are also crossed out here.

Q is calculated as the square root of 0.3 times the difference between 419.05 and 29.248, with additional terms involving velocity crossed out, resulting in approximately 62,182 Watts.

The enthalpy at outlet, h_aus, is 419.05 kilojoules per kilogram, and the enthalpy at inlet, h_ein, is 29.248 kilojoules per kilogram.

The term "turb. A-2" is mentioned, possibly referring to a specific point or condition in a turbine system.
