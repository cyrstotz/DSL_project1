T dot equals Q dot divided by h2 minus h1 equals delta h over delta s equals h2 minus h1 over s2 minus s1.

h2 is labeled as "above."

h1 is labeled as "below."

s sub f at 288.15 Kelvin equals 0.2245 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

s sub f at 258.15 Kelvin equals 0.3674 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

T dot equals 0.2245 minus 0.3674 divided by 104.83 minus 62.83 equals 0.2245 minus 0.3674 divided by 104.83 minus 288.15 equals 253.2 Kelvin.
