In a table, the column headers are \( T_{env} \) and \( x \), with the corresponding values being 0 and 0.6 respectively.

The equation \( U_{g1} \) equals 0.633 times \( m_g \) times \( T_1 \), which equals 1.673 kilojoules.

The equation \( U_{m1} \) is given by \( x_i \) times 533.948 plus \( (1 - x_i) \) times -0.045, all multiplied by \( m_{m1, \text{Tab 1}} \), which results in -20000 kilojoules.

Finally, \( U_{end} \) is calculated as one-half of \( m_1 \) plus one-half of \( U_{m1} \), resulting in -2.768 kilojoules.
