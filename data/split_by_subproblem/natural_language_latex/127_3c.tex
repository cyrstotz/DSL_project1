The change in energy, denoted as Delta E, is equal to E2 minus E1, which is equal to Q12. This is further expressed as m2 times u2 minus m1 times u1, which equals Q12. It can also be represented as m2 times cv times the difference in temperatures Tg2 minus Tg1.

Q12 is calculated as 3.423 grams times 0.653 kilojoules per kilogram-kelvin times the sum of 5000 degrees Celsius and 0.003 degrees Celsius.

Finally, Q12 equals 1.0856 kilojoules.
