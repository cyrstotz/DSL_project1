e) The temperature would continue to fall until it reaches zero, as energy is continuously being removed.

f) Intermediate, n equals zero, the ratio T2 over T1 equals the ratio of pa1 over pa2 raised to the power of (gamma minus one) over gamma, tends towards 1, which implies T1 times the ratio of v2 over v1 equals T2.
