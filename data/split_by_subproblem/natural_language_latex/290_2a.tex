The equation \( p_{3,1} \cdot m_{3,1} \) equals what?

For a perfect gas: the molar mass \( M_g \) is 50 kilograms per kilomole, and the specific heat at constant volume \( c_v \) is 0.673 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The volume \( V_{3,1} \) is 0.00574 cubic meters.

The diameter \( D \) is 0.1 meters.

The area \( A \) is calculated as \( D^2 \cdot \pi \) which equals 0.0074 square meters.

The volume \( V \) is \( D \cdot A \) which equals \( D \cdot 0.0074 \) square meters.

The pressure \( p_{3,1} \) is calculated using the formula \( \frac{m_g \cdot R \cdot T_1}{V_{3,1}} \) where \( R \) is \( \frac{8.317 \times 10^3}{50} \) which equals 166.28 Joules per kilogram.

The pressure \( p_{3,1} \) equals what?

The pressure \( P \) is calculated as \( \frac{F}{A} \) where \( F \) is 32.7 kilograms.

The pressure \( p_{3,1} \) is \( 1 \) bar plus \( \frac{32.7 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2}{0.0074 \, \text{m}^2} \) which equals 1.1 bars.

The mass of the gas \( m_g \) is \( \frac{p_{3,1} \cdot V_{3,1}}{R \cdot T_{3,1}} \) which equals 0.002687 kilograms.

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is \( \dot{m}_{eis} (u_1 - u_2) \) which equals 0.85 kilojoules.

The difference \( u_1 - u_2 \) is 8.5 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy \( u_1 \) is \( u_f(0^\circ C) + 0.6 \left( u_{fg}^{0^\circ C} \right) \) which equals 333.458 plus 0.6 times \( 0.045 \times 333.495 \) which equals -133.4102 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy \( u_2 \) is -141.91 kilojoules per kilogram which equals \( u_{ice}(0.05^\circ C) + x \left( u_{eis} - u_{ice} \right) \).

The value \( x \) is \( \frac{-141.91 + 333.458}{-0.057 + 333.458} \) which equals approximately 0.574.
