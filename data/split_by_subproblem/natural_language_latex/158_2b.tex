The task is to find the values of omega_6 and T_6.

Given:
- The pressure p_5 is 0.5 bar.
- The velocity omega_5 is 220 meters per second.
- The ratio of T_6 to T_5 is equal to the ratio of p_6 to p_5 raised to the power of (kappa minus 1) divided by kappa.
- T_6 is equal to T_5 times the ratio of p_6 to p_5 raised to the power of (kappa minus 1) divided by kappa.
- T_5 is 328.07 Kelvin.
- The ratio of p_6 to p_5 is the ratio of 1.5 MPa to 50 kPa, which equals 43.5.

From the equations:
- One sixth equals 43.5 times the ratio of 1.5 MPa to 50 kPa raised to the power of (kappa minus 1) divided by kappa.
- The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between h_5 and h_6 plus half the difference of the squares of omega_5 and omega_6 equals zero.

Additionally:
- Omega_3 is equal to omega_6.
- Omega_6 is to be determined.
