Adiabatic Throttle: \( h_4 = h_1 \) from the first law of thermodynamics.

The quality at state 4 is \( x_4 = 0 \), the pressure at state 4 is 8 bar (isochoric process from state 3 to 4).

From Table A-11, it implies \( h_4 = 93.42 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} = h_1 \).

The pressure at state 1 equals the pressure at state 2 (isobaric process).

The quality at state 2 is \( x_2 = 1 \), the temperature at state 2 is -22 degrees Celsius, which implies the pressure at state 2 is 1.21926 bar, equal to the pressure at state 1.

The quality \( x_A \) is calculated as \( \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} \).

This results in \( x_A = 0.337 \).
