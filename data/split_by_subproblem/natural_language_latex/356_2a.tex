The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled T with units in brackets [U]. The horizontal axis is labeled S with units in brackets [S]. The graph contains several curves and points:
- Point 0 at the bottom left.
- Point 1 directly above point 0, labeled "isentropic".
- Point 2 to the right of point 1, labeled "isentropic".
- Point 3 above point 2, labeled "adiabatic + irreversible".
- Point 4 to the left of point 3, labeled "isobaric".
- Point 5 below point 4, labeled "isobaric".
- Point 6 below point 5, labeled "isentropic".

The points are connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process:
- An arrow from point 0 to point 1.
- An arrow from point 1 to point 2.
- An arrow from point 2 to point 3.
- An arrow from point 3 to point 4.
- An arrow from point 4 to point 5.
- An arrow from point 5 to point 6.

The temperature at point 0 is marked as 243.15.
