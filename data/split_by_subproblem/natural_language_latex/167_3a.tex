The density rho is equal to 3.1 divided by A, which is equal to mass m divided by volume V. This implies that the ambient pressure p_amb is equal to 7.4 times 0.94 bar.

The equation pV equals mRT.

This implies that the mass m is equal to pV divided by RT, which is equal to pV divided by R times T, resulting in 3.4217 grams.
