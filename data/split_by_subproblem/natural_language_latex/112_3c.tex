The equation Q subscript 12 equals m subscript 2 times u subscript 2 minus m subscript 1 times u subscript 1, which equals m subscript EW times c subscript v times the quantity T subscript 2, EW minus T subscript 1, EW.

For the second part, it seems incomplete and not properly formatted in LaTeX, but it includes:
U subscript g minus u subscript g times 0.0033 times.
