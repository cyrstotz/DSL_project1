- \( q_{Q2} \) transition
- \( u_{21} \) with \( \frac{u_{21}}{m_{21}} = \frac{W_{21}}{m_{21}} \) implies
- \( m g c_v (T_{2g} - T_1) = u_2 - u_1 = -1.084 \, \text{kJ} \)
- The term \( p \cdot v \cdot m \cdot k \) is crossed out.
- \( W_{21} \) through gas equals \( \frac{R \cdot (T_2 - T_1)}{1 - n} \)
- \( n \) implies 2
- \( T_{Ew,2} = T_{g,2} \)
