R minus R divided by M equals R divided by 50 grams per mole, which equals 0.1663 Joules per gram Kelvin, which is equal to 166.3 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.

The pressure p_g1 equals the ambient pressure p_amb plus the ratio of mg over A.

The total mass m_total equals the mass of k m_k plus the mass of EW m_EW, which equals 32 kilograms plus 1.1 kilograms, resulting in 33.1 kilograms.

The area A equals 0.05 square meters, and pi r squared equals 0.002854 square meters.

The pressure p_g1 equals 1.10 Pascals plus the ratio of 33.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared over 0.002854 square meters, resulting in 1.910 bar.

The mass m_g equals the ratio of p1 times V1 over R times T1, which equals 1.9 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals times 3.146 times 10 to the power of -3 cubic meters over 166.25 Joules per kilogram Kelvin times 773.15 Kelvin, resulting in 0.0039 kilograms.

The mass m_g equals 3.92 grams.
