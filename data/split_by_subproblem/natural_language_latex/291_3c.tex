For subtask c):

Q12 equals Gas isobar.
From state 1 to state 2,
W12 equals the integral from 1 to 2 of p dv, which is equal to R T times the quantity one over T1 minus one over T2.
0 equals Delta E minus m times the quantity u2 minus u1, which equals Qab minus W12 minus W12.
Qab equals m times c_v times the quantity T2 minus T1, which equals 0.00584 Joules, or 5.84 milliJoules.

For the next part:
From state 1 to state 2,
Delta E equals m times the quantity u2 minus u1, and the term Qab minus W is canceled and equals zero, indicated by "gegW" (contradictory).
Qab equals m times the quantity u1 plus u2, which equals m times c_v times the quantity T1 minus T2, which equals negative 1139.4 Joules, indicated by "gegl√§rt" (clarified).
