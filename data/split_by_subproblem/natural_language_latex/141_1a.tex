The heat flow out, denoted as Q-dot-out, is given by the equation:
Q-dot equals m-dot times the difference between h-e and h-a, plus Q-dot-R plus Q-dot-out.

The balance at the reactor is described by:
Q-dot equals m-dot times the difference between h-e and h-a, plus Q-dot-R plus Q-dot-out.

Rearranging gives:
Q-dot-out equals m-dot times the difference between h-a and h-e, minus Q-dot-R.

Substituting values, we have:
Q-dot-out equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 449.04 and 292.58, minus 400 kilowatts, which equals negative 62.18 kilowatts.

The enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius, h-a, is 449.04 (from Tds A-2).
The enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius, h-e, is 292.58 (from Tds A-2).
