A equals 5 square centimeters times pi, which equals 0.00785 cubic meters.

F equals m times g, which equals 317.9 Newtons.

P_e equals 317.9 Newtons divided by 7.85 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters, which equals 0.84 bar.

P equals 1 bar plus 0.9 bar, which equals 1.9 bar.

M equals 50 kilograms per kilomole.

m equals pV divided by RT, which equals 0.0034 kilograms, or 3.4 grams.

T equals 773.75 Kelvin.

phi equals 7.9 times 10 to the power of 3 Pascals.

R equals R bar divided by M, which equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole Kelvin times 10 to the power of 3, divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole, which equals 766.28 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.

V equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.
