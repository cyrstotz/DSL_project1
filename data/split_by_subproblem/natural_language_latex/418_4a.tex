The graph is described as a pressure-temperature diagram, denoted as p-T diagram. The horizontal axis is labeled T in Kelvin, and the vertical axis is labeled p in bar. There are three points labeled as 1, 2, and 3 on the graph. Point 1 is connected to point 2 by a horizontal line labeled "isobaric expansion". Point 2 is connected to point 3 by a vertical line labeled "isothermal pressure reduction".
