- The second graph is a phase diagram with pressure \( p \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis.
- The y-axis is labeled with units in bar.
- The x-axis is labeled with units in Kelvin.
- There are three regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "gas."
- The graph shows a line sloping upwards from left to right, separating the "solid" and "gas" regions, with a point labeled \( T_{\text{triple}} \).
- An arrow labeled "Sublimation" points from the "solid" region to the "gas" region.

The initial temperature \( T_i \) is 10 degrees Celsius.
The initial pressure \( p_{ii} \) is 2 millibar.
