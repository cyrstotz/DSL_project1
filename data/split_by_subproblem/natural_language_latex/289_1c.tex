The temperature T is 250 degrees Celsius and the heat output Q_out is 65 kJ.

The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate m times the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance, plus the difference between the heat rate Q_R and the heat output Q_out divided by the temperature T, plus the generated entropy rate S_erz.

The generated entropy rate S_erz equals the mass flow rate m times the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance, plus the difference between the heat output Q_out and the heat rate Q_R divided by the temperature T, which equals 0.01304.

The entropy at the entrance s_a at 100 degrees Celsius equals the entropy of fluid s_f at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 7.306 kJ per kg Kelvin.

The entropy at the exit s_e at 70 degrees Celsius equals the entropy of fluid s_f at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 0.5949 kJ per kg Kelvin.

It is not possible.

The generated entropy rate S_erz is zero.

Negative 0.01304 due to rounding errors.
