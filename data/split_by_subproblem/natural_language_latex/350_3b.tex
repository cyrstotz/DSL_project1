b) T_g2 over p_g2

(It is correct, therefore x_1 is less than x_2 previously)

The temperature of the gas decreases due to heat transfer.

The pressure remains p_1, since the external conditions do not change.

The temperature will reach just about 0 degrees Celsius, as the water has a much higher...
