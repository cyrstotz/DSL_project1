Section c) (with solution variables: average temperature T_KF equals 295 K)

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance plus the sum over i of the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature at i plus the generated entropy rate.

The entropy at the exit, s_e, equals 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

The entropy at the entrance, s_a, equals 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin, as per Table 4.2.

This implies that the generated entropy rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit plus the heat transfer rate at the exit times the reciprocal of the temperature at KF equals

equals 0.3 kilograms per second times (1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin minus 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin) plus 62.182 kilowatts divided by 295 Kelvin

equals 0.316 kilojoules per Kelvin per second.

Continuation of 1c)

The change in mass from state 1 to state 2 equals the heat transfer rate for R,12 minus the generated mass at state 1 times the difference in enthalpy between the exit and 20 degrees Celsius, all divided by the difference in enthalpy between 20 degrees Celsius and 70 degrees Celsius.

equals 36.14 kilograms.
