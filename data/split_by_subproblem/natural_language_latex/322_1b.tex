The average temperature for the unsteady-state heat conduction problem, denoted as T-bar subscript uKP, is equal to the integral of temperature T with respect to entropy S from the initial entropy S-subscript-ein to the final entropy S-subscript-aus, divided by the difference between the final entropy S-subscript-aus and the initial entropy S-subscript-ein.
