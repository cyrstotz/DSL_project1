a) The temperature does not need to increase, steady flow process.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat transfer rate in, plus the heat transfer rate out.

The heat transfer rate out equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet, minus the heat transfer rate in.

Boiling liquid taken as pure water.

The enthalpy at the outlet equals the enthalpy of vaporization at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 2257.0 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at the inlet equals the enthalpy of vaporization at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 2333.8 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat transfer rate in is 100 kilowatts.

The heat transfer rate out is negative 123.04 kilowatts.
