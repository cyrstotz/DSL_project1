The graph is a plot with the horizontal axis labeled \( T \) and the vertical axis labeled \( P \). The plot starts at the origin and rises steeply to a point labeled \( 1 \). From there, it continues to rise more gradually to a peak labeled \( 4 \). The peak is connected to a point labeled \( 3 \) by a horizontal line. From point \( 3 \), the plot descends steeply and then curves downwards, passing through a point labeled \( 2 \) and continuing to the right. The region between points \( 1 \) and \( 4 \) is marked as \( 1504 \), and the region between points \( 4 \) and \( 3 \) is marked as \( 1504 \). The region between points \( 3 \) and \( 2 \) is marked as \( isodv \).
