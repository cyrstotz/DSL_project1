Theorem on Flow Processes:
Zero equals the mass flow rate at the control face times the quantity of enthalpy at the exit minus enthalpy at the entrance plus one half the difference of the square of velocity at the exit and the square of velocity at the entrance plus the gravitational acceleration times the difference in height from the exit to the entrance. This equals the heat flow rate at the control face.

Stationary Reactor: (since the system mass is constant, the mass flow rate in equals the mass flow rate out)
Zero equals the mass flow rate entering times the quantity of enthalpy at the exit minus enthalpy at the entrance plus one half the difference of the square of velocity at the exit and the square of velocity at the entrance plus the gravitational acceleration times the difference in height from the exit to the entrance plus the heat flow rate out plus the heat flow rate due to reaction.

The heat flow rate out equals the heat flow rate in.

The enthalpy at the exit, denoted as h_e, at 70 degrees Celsius is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.
The enthalpy at the entrance, denoted as h_a, at 600 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat flow rate out is calculated as 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference in enthalpy from 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram to 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram plus 100 kilojoules per second.

This results in 62.182 kilowatts.
