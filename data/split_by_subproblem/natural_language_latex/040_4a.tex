There is a graph with the y-axis labeled as p in bars and the x-axis labeled as T in Kelvin. The graph contains four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is located at the intersection of the x-axis and a horizontal line extending from point 2. Point 2 is positioned to the right of point 1 on the x-axis. Point 3 is located above point 2 on a vertical line. Point 4 is to the left of point 3 on a horizontal line. Arrows indicate the direction of the process: from point 1 to point 2, from point 2 to point 3, from point 3 to point 4, and from point 4 back to point 1. The process from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "isentropic". The process from point 2 to point 3 is also labeled as "isentropic". The process from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "isobaric". The process from point 4 to point 1 is labeled as "pressure reduction".
