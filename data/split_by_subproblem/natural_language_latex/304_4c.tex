The mass flow rate times the difference between the upper enthalpy and the lower enthalpy is greater than zero. This implies that the upper enthalpy equals the ambient enthalpy. Consequently, the mass flow rate equals the mass flow rate times the ambient enthalpy, as noted in Table A-11. The value is 93.42. The upper temperature equals the lower temperature.
