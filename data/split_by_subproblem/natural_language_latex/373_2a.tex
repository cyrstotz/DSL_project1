The text describes a T-s diagram, which is a graph with the y-axis labeled as T and the x-axis labeled as s with units kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin. The graph features three isotherms labeled from top to bottom as T_B, T_S, and T_0. It includes five points labeled 1 through 5. The connections between the points are as follows:
- Point 1 is located at the bottom left.
- Point 1 is connected vertically to Point 2.
- Point 2 is connected horizontally to Point 3.
- Point 3 is connected vertically to Point 4.
- Point 4 is connected horizontally to Point 5.
Additionally, there is a dashed vertical line extending upwards from Point 4.
