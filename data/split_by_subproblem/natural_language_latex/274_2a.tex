a) T-S Diagram, isobaric units

- A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled s in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and the y-axis labeled T in Kelvin.
- The graph contains a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The curve is divided into segments:
  - Segment 1-2: labeled "adiabatic"
  - Segment 2-3: labeled "isobaric"
  - Segment 3-4: labeled "adiabatic"
  - Segment 4-5: labeled "isobaric"
  - Segment 5-6: labeled "adiabatic"
- The points are connected as follows:
  - Point 1 to Point 2: a steep curve upwards
  - Point 2 to Point 3: a horizontal line to the right
  - Point 3 to Point 4: a steep curve downwards
  - Point 4 to Point 5: a horizontal line to the right
  - Point 5 to Point 6: a steep curve upwards

- 6-1: compressed adiabatic, isentropic efficiency
- 1-2: adiabatic reversible high pressure
- 2-3: isobaric heat addition
- 3-4: adiabatic, irreversible
- 4-5: isobaric heat removal
- 5-6: reversible adiabatic
