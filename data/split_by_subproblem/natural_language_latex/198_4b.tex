Energy conservation around the compressor:
Zero equals the product of the mass flow rate of the cycle (h2 minus h3) plus the heat transfer rate minus the power output of the compressor.
The power output of the compressor divided by (h2 minus h3) equals the mass flow rate of the cycle.
h2 equals the enthalpy at state 2 as a function of temperature T2.
T2 equals T1 minus 6 Kelvin.
With the condition from ii), T1 can be determined using the pressure-temperature diagram: T1 equals 10 degrees Celsius.
T1 equals 283.15 Kelvin.
