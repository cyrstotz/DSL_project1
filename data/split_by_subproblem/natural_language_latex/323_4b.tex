1. High Side Compressor:
The equation is zero equals mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and enthalpy at state 3, plus heat transfer rate minus work rate.

The equation is repeated: zero equals mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and enthalpy at state 3, plus heat transfer rate minus work rate.

The enthalpy at state 2 equals the enthalpy at state 2 in gas phase because the quality x equals 1.

The temperature T1 is 288.15 Kelvin and the temperature T2 is 271.45 Kelvin.

For part 4b:
The internal combustion efficiency E_ic is the absolute value of the ratio of heat transfer rate in to electrical work rate, which equals the absolute value of the ratio of heat transfer rate out to cooling work rate, which equals one over 28w.

The heat transfer rate in for the first high side first heat exchanger.

The equation is zero equals mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and enthalpy at state 2, plus the heat transfer rate out.

The equation is zero equals mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 1 and enthalpy at state 2, plus the heat transfer rate out.

The heat transfer rate out equals the square of the mass flow rate divided by the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and enthalpy at state 1.
