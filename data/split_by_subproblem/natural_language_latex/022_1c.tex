Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between entropy at point c and entropy at point a, plus the heat flow rate divided by temperature T, plus the generated entropy S_erz.

Graphical Description:
There is a horizontal rectangular diagram labeled "Reactor" with two arrows pointing outwards from the sides labeled Q_dot_out. The left side is labeled T1 equals 100 degrees Celsius and the right side is labeled T2 equals 295 Kelvin. Below the rectangle, there is another label "Shell".

Zero equals the heat flow rate divided by temperature T plus the generated entropy S_erz equals the heat flow rate out divided by T1 minus the heat flow rate out divided by T2 plus the generated entropy S_erz.

The generated entropy S_erz equals the heat flow rate out divided by T2 minus the heat flow rate out divided by T1.

The generated entropy S_erz equals the heat flow rate out times the difference between the reciprocal of T2 and the reciprocal of T1.

This equals 0.0461 kilojoules per Kelvin.
