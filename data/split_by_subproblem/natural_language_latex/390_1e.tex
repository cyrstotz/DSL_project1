Entropy balance in the reaction mixture, semi-open system:

The change in entropy, Delta S, equals the mass flow rate in times the entropy in minus the mass flow rate out times the entropy out, divided by the mass flow rate, plus the heat flow rate divided by the temperature out, times the entropy out. This equation is simplified to:

Delta S equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the final entropy and the initial entropy.

Delta S equals the mass at state 2 times the entropy at state 2 minus the mass at state 1 times the entropy at state 1, which implies that the mass at state 2 equals the mass at state 1 plus the change in mass.

This simplifies to the change in mass times the entropy at state 2.

The change in entropy, Delta S, is 12,227.43 kilojoules per Kelvin.

The initial mass, m1, equals the total mass, which is 5,755 kilograms. The change in mass, Delta m2, is 3,469.69 kilograms, which implies that the mass at state 2, m2, is 9,224.69 kilograms.

From Table A-2:
The entropy at state 2, s2, at 70 degrees Celsius is 0.9749 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
The entropy at state 1, s1, at 70 degrees Celsius is 71.30 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
