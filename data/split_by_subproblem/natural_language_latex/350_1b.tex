The average temperature T-bar is given by the equation:

T-bar equals the integral from 'ein' to 'aus' of T ds, divided by s_aus minus s_ein, which equals the integral from 'ein' to 'aus' of T ds, divided by the integral from T_ein to T_aus of c_p over T dT.

This implies that T-bar equals the sum of T_aus and T_ein divided by 2, which equals 293.15 Kelvin, and this is equal to T-bar.

The text states that T can be arithmetically averaged because it is an ideal fluid.
