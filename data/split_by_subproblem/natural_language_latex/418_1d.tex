Section d) Energy conservation:

The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum over i of the mass flow rate of i at time t times the enthalpy of i at time t, plus the mass flow rate at the exit at time t times the enthalpy at the exit at time t, plus the sum over i of the heat flow rate of i at time t, minus the sum over i of the work flow rate of i at time t.

The heat transfer from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the change in mass from state 1 to state 2 times the difference in enthalpy between 20 degrees Celsius and 70 degrees Celsius, plus the mass at state 1 under certain conditions times the difference in enthalpy between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at 40 degrees Celsius.

Subsection: where

The enthalpy at 20 degrees Celsius is 83.96 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at the exit is equal to an unspecified number (represented by a hash symbol) plus the dryness fraction times 0.2257, all multiplied by kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 430.325 kilojoules per kilogram.
