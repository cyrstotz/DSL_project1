The equations are as follows:

1. \( h_2 \) equals \( h_f \) plus \( x \) times the difference between \( h_{fg} \) and \( h_f \).
2. \( h_q \) equals \( h_f \) times the fraction of 8 bar over 9.3 kg, multiplied by the fraction of \( (T_{ab} - A - 12) \) over \( (T_{ab} - A - 12) \).
3. \( x \) equals the fraction of \( (h_q - h_f) \) over \( (h_{fg} - h_f) \).
4. \( x \) equals the fraction of \( (h_q - h_f) \) over \( (h_{fg} - h_f) \). Additionally, find and substitute the values for \( h_{f(\text{liquid})} \) and \( h_{f(\text{gas})} \).
