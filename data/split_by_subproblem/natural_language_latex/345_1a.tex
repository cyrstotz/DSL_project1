Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance, plus the rate of heat added, minus the rate of heat removed.

The enthalpy at exit, h_e, is 202.98 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced from Table A-2.

The enthalpy at entrance, h_a, is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced from Table A-2.

The rate of heat removed, denoted as Q_aus, equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance, plus the rate of heat added, which equals 62.18 kilowatts.
