Graph description: The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled s in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled T in Kelvin. The graph contains six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected as follows:
- Point 1 to Point 2 is a vertical line labeled "isotropic".
- Point 2 to Point 3 is a curved line labeled "isobaric".
- Point 3 to Point 4 is a vertical line labeled "isotropic".
- Point 4 to Point 5 is a curved line labeled "isobaric".
- Point 5 to Point 6 is a vertical line labeled "isotropic".
- Point 6 to Point 1 is a curved line labeled "isobaric".
