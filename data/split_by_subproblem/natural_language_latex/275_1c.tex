The average temperatures T1 bar and T2 bar are both 393.15.

There is a diagram showing heat flow out, denoted as Q dot out, pointing downwards, which then leads to negative Q dot out.

This results in the equation for the rate of change of energy E dot with respect to time t, which equals negative Q dot out plus Q dot out divided by T2 plus Q dot out divided by T1 plus s rev.

The equation negative Q dot out divided by T1 plus Q dot out divided by T2 equals the reversible entropy change rate S dot rev, which is equal to 0.053875 kilojoules per second Kelvin.
