The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled 'S' in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled 'T' in degrees Celsius. The graph consists of several curves and lines:
- A curve starting from point 0 to point 1 labeled as "isentrop".
- A horizontal line from point 1 to point 2 labeled as "isobar".
- A vertical line from point 2 to point 3 labeled as "isotherm".
- A curve from point 3 to point 4 labeled as "isentrop".
- A horizontal line from point 4 to point 5 labeled as "isobar".
- A vertical line from point 5 to point 6 labeled as "isotherm".
- A curve from point 6 back to point 0 labeled as "isentrop".
There are also dashed lines indicating the isotherms and isobars, and a shaded area between points 4 and 5.
