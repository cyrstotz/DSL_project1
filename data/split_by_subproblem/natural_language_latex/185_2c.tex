The mass flow rate is represented by m dot.

The equation for the exergy input, E_x,in, is equal to the exergy storage, E_x,stro, minus the exergy storage, E_x,stro.

The term "Exergieinlanz" translates to "Exergy inflow."

The exergy stream, E_x,str, is given by the equation:
m dot times the quantity (h_2 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus half the difference of w_out squared minus w_6 squared).

The exergy stream, E_x,str, simplifies to:
h_2 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus half the difference of w_out squared minus w_6 squared.

Substituting values, it becomes:
79.9 minus 243.15 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus half the difference of 200 squared minus 5.8 squared.

This simplifies further to:
968.56 plus half the difference of 200 squared minus 5.8 squared.

The difference in entropy, s_6 minus s_0, is given by:
s^0 at T_0 minus s^0 at T_0 minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p_6 over p_0.

This can be rewritten as:
c_p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_6 over T_0 minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p_6 over p_0.

Substituting values, it becomes:
1.0889 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 314.95 over 243.1 equals 0.362 kJ/kgK.

The ratio of c_p over c_v equals n, leading to:
c_p equals 1.4 times c_v, which equals 1.4 times 0.688, resulting in 1.4084.
