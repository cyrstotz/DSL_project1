The change in specific exergy due to the stream, denoted as delta e subscript x, str, is equal to e subscript x, str, b minus e subscript x, str, zero. The initial specific exergy, e subscript x, str, zero, is calculated as follows: h subscript zero minus h subscript zero minus T subscript zero times (s minus s subscript zero) plus v squared over 2. This simplifies to c subscript p times (T subscript 6 minus T subscript zero) minus T subscript zero times (s subscript 6 minus s subscript zero) plus v squared over 2. Substituting the values, it becomes 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (340 Kelvin minus 431.9 Kelvin) minus 243.15 kilojoules per kilogram times (4.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times 340 divided by 243) plus one half times (510 meters per second squared). The boundary specific exergy, e subscript x, str, b, is equal to 220 meters per second, which simplifies to 65.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

Continuing, the initial specific exergy, e subscript x, str, zero, is calculated as c subscript p times dot s of T subscript zero minus dot s of s subscript zero plus dot u. Substituting the values, it becomes -1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times 743.15 Kelvin minus 243.15 kilojoules per kilogram times zero plus one half times (200 meters per second squared). This results in -19.755 kilojoules per kilogram. The difference between e subscript x, str, zero and e subscript x, str, zero is 85 kilojoules per kilogram. Therefore, the change in specific exergy, delta e subscript x, str, is 85 kilojoules per kilogram.
