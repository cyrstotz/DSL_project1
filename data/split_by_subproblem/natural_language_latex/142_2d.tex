The actual specific exergy, denoted as e_{x, ist}, is equal to 100 kilojoules per kilogram.

The equation is zero equals the actual specific exergy plus the product of one minus the ratio of T_0 over T and q_B, plus the real specific exergy.

The real specific exergy, denoted as e_{x, real}, is equal to the negative of the actual specific exergy plus the product of one minus the ratio of T_0 over T and q_B.

This results in the real specific exergy being equal to negative 69.58 kilojoules per kilogram.
