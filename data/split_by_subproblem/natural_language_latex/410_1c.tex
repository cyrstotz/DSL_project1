The average temperature T_EF minus 293 Kelvin divided by the heat flow rate Q_aus equals 65 kilowatts.

Zero equals the heat flow rate Q_aus divided by the temperature of the reactor minus the heat flow rate Q_aus divided by the average temperature T_EF plus the entropy generation rate S_ez.

The entropy generation rate S_ez equals the heat flow rate Q_aus divided by the average temperature T_EF minus the heat flow rate Q_aus divided by the temperature of the reactor, which equals 46.146 kilojoules.

Graphical Description:

There is a horizontal rectangular box labeled "Reaktor" with an arrow pointing upwards labeled Q_aus and another arrow pointing downwards labeled Q_ein. The box is connected to a label "Wand" on the right side. Below the box, there is a label "T_reaktor equals 57.3 Kelvin".
