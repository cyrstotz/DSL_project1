The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram with the following details:

- The x-axis is labeled s in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
- The y-axis is labeled T in degrees Celsius.
- There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Point 0 is at the origin.
- Point 1 is higher than point 0, both in terms of T and s.
- Point 2 is vertically above point 1, indicating an isentropic process (s1 equals s2).
- Point 3 is to the right of point 2, indicating an isobaric process (p3 equals p2).
- Point 4 is below point 3, indicating a decrease in entropy (s3 is less than s4).
- Point 5 is to the right of point 4, indicating an isobaric process (p4 equals p5 equals 0.5 bar).
- Point 6 is vertically below point 5, indicating an isentropic process (s5 equals s6).

The graph includes the following annotations:
- "Isobar" between points 1 and 2.
- "Isentrop" between points 2 and 3.
- "Isobar" between points 3 and 4.
- "Isentrop" between points 4 and 5.
- "Isotherm" along the x-axis.
