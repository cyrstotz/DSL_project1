P subscript 3j equals the fraction of R subscript j times T subscript 1 over m subscript j times V subscript 1.

R subscript j equals the fraction of R over mu subscript j, which equals 0.166285944.

P subscript 3j equals the fraction of F over A, which equals P atmospheric plus the fraction of F subscript K over A plus the fraction of F subscript EW over A.

F subscript K equals 32 kilograms times g, which equals 313.813 Newtons.

A equals pi times r squared, which equals pi times the fraction of d squared over 4, which equals 0.00785 square meters.

F subscript EW equals m subscript EW times g, which equals 0.391 Newtons.

P subscript 3 equals 140080.8163 Pascals, which equals 1.4008 bar.

m subscript j equals the fraction of P subscript 3 times V subscript j over R subscript j times T subscript 1, which equals 3.42 grams.
