Q subscript 12 equals m times the difference between u subscript 2 and u subscript 1.

Q subscript 12 equals m times 0.653 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference between T subscript 2 and T subscript 1.

Q subscript 12 equals negative 1082.183.

Student Solution:

- State 2 Q equals 0.
- m subscript 6 times the difference between u subscript 2 and u subscript 1 equals m subscript EL times the difference between u subscript 2 and u subscript 1.
- m times c subscript v times the difference between T subscript 2 and T subscript 1 equals m times c subscript w times the difference between u subscript 2 and u subscript 1.
- 1,139.89.
- Negative 11,353.03 times D over eta subscript 12 times the difference between u subscript 2 and u subscript 1.
- u subscript 1 equals negative 133.91.
- u subscript 1 equals negative 146 and 12 over 19.
- Interpolation at p subscript 2 equals 0.003 equals (x minus u subscript f) divided by (u subscript g minus u subscript f).
- x equals (negative 146 minus u subscript f) divided by (u subscript g minus u subscript f).
- x equals 560.568.
