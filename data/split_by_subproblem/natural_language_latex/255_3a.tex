The equation is:
p1 equals p_amb plus mk times the fraction of g over pi times the square of D over 2, plus m_EW times the fraction of g over pi times the square of D over 2. Simplifying further, it equals p_amb plus the fraction of mk times g over pi times the square of D over 2, plus the fraction of m_EW times g over pi times the square of D over 2, which equals 71.9005 bar.
