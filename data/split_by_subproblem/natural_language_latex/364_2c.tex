The specific work for an exergy stream at state 0 is equal to the mass flow rate times the quantity of enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus the product of temperature at state 0 and the difference in entropy between state 6 and state 0 plus half the square of velocity at state 0 minus half the square of velocity at state 6.

The specific exergy at state 6 is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between state 6 and state 0 minus the product of temperature at state 0 and specific heat at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature at state 6 to temperature at state 0 minus the gas constant times the natural logarithm of the ratio of pressure at state 6 to pressure at state 0.

Substituting values, the specific exergy at state 6 is equal to 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference between 328.075 Kelvin and 243.15 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin times 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 328.075 Kelvin to 243.15 Kelvin.

The specific exergy at state 6 is equal to the enthalpy at state 6 minus the enthalpy at state 0 minus the product of temperature at state 0 and the difference in entropy between state 6 and state 0 plus half the square of velocity at state 0 minus half the square of velocity at state 6, which equals 12.45 kilojoules per kilogram.
