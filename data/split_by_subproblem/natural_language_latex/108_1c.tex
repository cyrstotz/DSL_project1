The equation is asking for the value of S_{e2}. It is given by the formula:
\[
\frac{Q_{\text{aus}}}{\overline{T}_{\text{KF}}} = S_{e2} = 0.29 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]
This translates to: the ratio of Q_{aus} over the average temperature T_{KF} equals S_{e2}, which equals 0.29 kilojoules per Kelvin.
