The rate of exergy change due to the surroundings, denoted as E dot subscript ex, sr, equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the specific exergy, e subscript ex, sr. This is equal to the mass flow rate, m dot, times the expression in brackets: h minus h zero minus T zero times (s minus s zero) plus v squared over 2 plus p e over rho.
