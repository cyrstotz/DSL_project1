The area of the cylinder, denoted as \( A_{\text{Zylinder}} \), is calculated as \( 0.1 \, \text{m}^2 \) times \( \pi \), which equals \( 0.0314 \, \text{m}^2 \).

The density \( \rho \) is given by \( \frac{N}{m^2} \).

The external force, denoted as \( F_{\text{aussen}} \), is calculated as \( 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \) times \( 0.0314 \, \text{m}^2 \) plus \( 32 \, \text{kg} \) times \( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), which equals \( 3455.5 \, \text{N} \).

The internal force times the area of the cylinder, \( F_{\text{innen}} \cdot A_{\text{Zylinder}} \), equals \( 3455.5 \, \text{N} \).

The internal pressure \( P_{\text{innen}} \) is equal to \( P_{a1} \) which is \( 1.1 \, \text{bar} \).

The molar mass \( M \) is \( 50 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{kmol}} \).

The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as \( \frac{\bar{R}}{M} \), which equals \( 166.28 \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} \).

The ratio \( \frac{pV}{RT} \) equals the mass \( m_{g1} \), which is underlined as \( 2.687 \, \text{g} \).
