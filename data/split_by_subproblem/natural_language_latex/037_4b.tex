T sub a is less than T sub i.

The equation zero equals the mass flow rate of R134a times the difference between h sub 2 and h sub 3, plus the power of a.

The mass flow rate of R134a equals negative the volume flow rate of a divided by the difference between h sub 2 and h sub 3, which is equal to the volume flow rate of K divided by the difference between h sub 3 and h sub 2.

S sub 3 equals S sub 2 because it is adiabatic and reversible.
