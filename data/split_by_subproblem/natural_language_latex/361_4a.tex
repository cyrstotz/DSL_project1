The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled T (Temperature) and the y-axis is labeled P (Pressure). There are three regions labeled "Solid", "Liquid", and "Gas". The boundary lines between these regions are shown, with a point labeled i on the line between "Solid" and "Liquid", a point labeled ii on the line between "Liquid" and "Gas", and a point labeled iii on the line between "Solid" and "Gas".
