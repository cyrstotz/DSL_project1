The equation is the ratio of Q dot over T subscript UF equals the integral from T1 to T2 of c subscript i plus of T dT divided by T2 minus T1, which equals the integral from T1 to T2 of c subscript i plus of T dT divided by T2 minus T1.

The equation for T subscript UF equals 298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of 298.15 Kelvin over 288.15 Kelvin, which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
