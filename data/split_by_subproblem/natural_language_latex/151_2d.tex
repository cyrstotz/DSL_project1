The residual exergy of x, denoted as e_{x,res}, equals T_0 times the residual entropy change of x, denoted as dot{s}_{x,res}. This is equal to T_0 times the difference in entropy between state 6 and state 0, plus the heat transfer at the boundary divided by T_0. Simplifying, this results in T_0 times the difference in entropy between state 6 and state 0.
