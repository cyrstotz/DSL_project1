Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the specific enthalpy at the inlet and the specific enthalpy at the outlet, plus the external heat transfer rate, plus the surrounding heat transfer rate, plus the miscellaneous heat transfer rate.

The specific enthalpy at the inlet corresponds to the saturation liquid at 70 degrees Celsius, which equals 293.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The specific enthalpy at the outlet corresponds to the saturation vapor at 100 degrees Celsius, which equals 2675.5 kilojoules per kilogram.

The external heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the specific enthalpy at the outlet and the specific enthalpy at the inlet, minus the internal heat transfer rate, which equals negative 62.1824 kilowatts.
