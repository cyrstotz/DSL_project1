c) The change in exergy due to the stream, denoted as Delta e_x,str, is equal to the expression enclosed in a box, which is h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus Delta ke.

The difference h_0 minus h_0 equals c_p times (T_6 minus T_0), which equals 1.006 times (328.07 minus (20 plus 273.15)), resulting in 85.93 kilojoules per kilogram.

T_0 is calculated as negative 20 plus 273.15, which equals 293.15.

The difference s_6 minus s_0 is equal to c_p times the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0) minus R_L times the natural logarithm of (p_6 divided by p_0), which results in 0.301 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

Delta ke is calculated as one-half times (W_6 squared minus W_0 squared), which equals one-half times (560 squared minus 200 squared), resulting in 110050 square meters per second squared.

Substituting the values into the expression for Delta e_x,str, we get 85.93 kilojoules per kilogram minus 293.15 times 0.301 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin plus 110050 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 122.22 kilojoules per kilogram, underlined.
