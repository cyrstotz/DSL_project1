State 1: x1 equals 0. The pressures p1 and p2 are both 8 bar.

The process is adiabatic.

Energy equation: The rate of heat transfer Q dot equals the mass flow rate m dot times the difference in enthalpy from state k2 to state k1 plus the rate of heat transfer Q dot.

TAB: The internal energy u1 equals u2 equals 53.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

State 2: Adiabatic line: The pressure p2 equals p1.

And it holds that: The temperature T2 equals negative 20 kilojoules per kilogram, the same as,

TAB: The temperature T1 equals 470 Kelvin.

x1 equals the fraction of h1 minus u1 over ug minus uf.

hf equals the average of 3.35 and 3.56.

The ratio of u2 over uf equals 36.365 times the ratio of u2 over ug.

u2 equals 26.345 times the ratio of u2 over uf.

This implies that x2 equals 0.2762.
