The average temperature T_RF is given by the equation:

T_RF bar equals the integral from s_a to s_e of T ds divided by s_a minus s_e, which equals the integral from s_a to s_e of dH divided by s_a minus s_e, which equals c_p f times the fraction (T_ausKF minus T_einKF) divided by the natural logarithm of (T_ausKF divided by T_einKF).

Substituting values, the fraction (298.15 minus 288.15) divided by the natural logarithm of (298.15 divided by 288.15) equals 293.12 Kelvin.
