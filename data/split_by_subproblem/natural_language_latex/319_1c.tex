The rate of change of total entropy \( S_{\text{ges}} \) with respect to time \( t \) is equal to the sum of the mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_i \) times the entropy \( s_i \) for each component \( i \), plus the heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_i \) divided by the temperature \( T_i \) for each component \( i \), plus the rate of entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{ere}} \).

The equation zero equals the heat transfer rate out \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \) divided by the cooling fluid temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \), plus the heat transfer rate out \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \) divided by the reactor temperature \( T_R \), plus the rate of entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{ere}} \).

The rate of entropy production \( \dot{S}_{\text{ere}} \) is equal to the heat transfer rate out \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \) times the difference between the reciprocal of the cooling fluid temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) and the reciprocal of the reactor temperature \( T_{\text{Reaktor}} \), which equals 0.0455 kilojoules per Kelvin.
