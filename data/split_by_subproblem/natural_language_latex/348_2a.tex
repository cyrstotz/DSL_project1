The graph description details a plot with the x-axis labeled as 's' in kilojoules per kilogram and the y-axis labeled as 'T' in Kelvin. It features three curves labeled as "isobar" with the labels: 'p_0 equals 0.15 bar', 'p_1 equals p_5', and 'p_2 equals p_5'. These curves are interconnected by lines with specific labels:
- A line from Point 1 to Point 2 labeled as "isotrop"
- A line from Point 2 to Point 3 labeled as "isobar"
- A line from Point 3 to Point 4 labeled as "isotrop"
- A line from Point 4 to Point 5 labeled as "isobar"
- A line from Point 5 to Point 6 labeled as "isotrop"

The points are connected in a cycle, starting and ending at the same point on the curve labeled 'p_0 equals 0.15 bar'.
