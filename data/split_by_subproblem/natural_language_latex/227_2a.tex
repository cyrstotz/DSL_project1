The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled S and the y-axis labeled T(K). The graph starts at point 1, moves vertically up to point 2, then curves downwards to point 3, and finally moves horizontally to point 4. The region between points 1 and 2 is shaded. The curve from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "Isotherm". The horizontal line from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "Isochore". There is a small curve from point 4 to point 5, and then a horizontal line from point 5 to point 6. The x-axis has an arrow pointing to the right, and the y-axis has an arrow pointing upwards. There is a label "WD" near the x-axis and a label "kJ/K" near the y-axis.
