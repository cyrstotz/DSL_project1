The volume V2 is equal to the mass of gas mg times the temperature at equilibrium Teq divided by the pressure p3,2, which equals 1.1092 times ten to the negative second cubic meters divided by 1.1002 liters.

The change in volume Delta V is negative 2.031 liters.

The work W3,2 is equal to the pressure p3,1 times the change in volume Delta V, which equals negative 284.3 Joules.
