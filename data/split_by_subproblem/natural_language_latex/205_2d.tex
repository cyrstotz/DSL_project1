Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between h zero and s zero plus the term one minus the ratio of T zero over T times the heat flow rate minus the work done by the turbine. The exergy destruction rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between h zero and s zero plus the term one minus the ratio of T zero over T times the heat flow rate minus the work done by the turbine. The average temperature T bar equals the reference temperature T R. The change in property x in times the mass flow rate equals one hundred kilojoules per kilogram, with the terms 'Turbine', 'Lead time', and 'Compressor'. The exergy destruction rate equals one hundred nine point five eight two kilojoules per kilogram.
