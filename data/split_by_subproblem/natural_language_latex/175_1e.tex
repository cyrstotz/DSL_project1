The section discusses calculations with previously computed data.

The change in entropy, Delta S, is given by the formula:
Delta S equals 0.012 times the difference between S1 and S2, plus the difference between the heat output Q_aus and the heat input Q_R divided by the temperature T, plus the entropy S_erz.

S1 is calculated as:
S1 equals S_f plus 0.005 times the difference between s_g and s_f, which equals 1.20069 plus 0.005 times the difference between 7.315 and 4.318, resulting in 1.33714 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

S2 times T, where T is 20 degrees Celsius, equals TA minus 2 times 20 degrees Celsius times s_g, which equals 8.6672 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Delta S is then recalculated as:
Delta S equals 3600 kilograms times the difference between 1.33714 and 8.6672, plus the difference between 25 megajoules and 35 megajoules divided by T, plus S_erz, resulting in -26380 kilojoules per Kelvin.
