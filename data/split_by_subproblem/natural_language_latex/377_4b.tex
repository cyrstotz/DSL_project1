The subsection is titled "1/15 compressed."

The equation given is:
Q equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times the difference between h2 and h3 minus the negative of the power (W dot).

The mass flow rate (m dot) is equal to the negative of the power (W dot) divided by the difference between h2 and h3, and it is noted to check the table for values of h2 and h3.

A table is presented with columns labeled T (temperature), P (pressure in bar), V (volume), x, W dot (power in Watts), and S (entropy). The rows are numbered 1 to 4, with specific entries:
- Row 2 has a pressure of 1 bar, x equals negative 28 times W dot, and W dot equals 0.
- Row 3 has a pressure of 8 bar.

The entropy change from state 2 to state 3, S23, is zero, indicating an adiabatic reversible process.
