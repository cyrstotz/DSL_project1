Entropy balance between coolant and reactor:

The rate of change of entropy with respect to time is equal to the rate of heat transfer out of the system divided by the temperature plus the generated entropy rate.

This implies that zero equals the rate of heat transfer out of the system divided by the temperature plus the generated entropy rate.

This further implies that the generated entropy rate equals negative of the rate of heat transfer out of the system divided by the coolant temperature, which equals negative of negative 37.808 kilowatts divided by 295 Kelvin, resulting in 0.7283 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
