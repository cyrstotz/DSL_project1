**Entropy balance**

The rate of change of entropy S with respect to time t is equal to the sum of the mass flow rate times entropy (sum of mi dot times si) plus the heat transfer rate divided by temperature (Q dot i over Ti) plus the reversible entropy generation (S dot rev).

Zero equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times the difference in entropy between inlet and outlet (s_in minus s_out) plus the heat transfer rate at the outlet divided by the temperature at the condensation point (Q dot out over T_KF).

The difference in entropy between inlet and outlet (s_in minus s_out) equals the integral from the outlet temperature to the inlet temperature of the specific heat capacity over temperature (c_if over T) dT, which simplifies to c_if times the natural logarithm of the ratio of inlet temperature to outlet temperature (T_in over T_out).

Implying another formula: the integral from s_e to s_a of T dS equals the integral from T_e to T_a of c_if dT, which simplifies to c_if times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_a to T_e (T_a over T_e).
