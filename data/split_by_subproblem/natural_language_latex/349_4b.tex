b) stationary flow process

Zero equals the mass flow rate of the mixture times the difference between h2 and h3 plus the volume flow rate of component K.

The mass flow rate of the mixture equals negative the volume flow rate of component A divided by the difference between h2 and h3.

s2 equals s3, p3 equals 8 bar, x2 equals 1.

p2 equals p4.

T2 equals Ti minus 6 Kelvin.
