d) The change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2, denoted as U2 minus U1, equals the heat transferred from 1 to 2, denoted as Q12, minus the work done, which is cancelled out, for an incompressible process.

The internal energy at state 2, U2, is equal to the heat transferred from 1 to 2, Q12, plus the internal energy at state 1, U1.

The internal energy at state 1, U1, is equal to the mass, m, times the specific internal energy at state 1, u1, which is 0.1 kilograms times the quantity negative 333.958 kilojoules per kilogram plus 0.9 times the quantity negative 0.695 kilojoules per kilogram plus 333.958 kilojoules per kilogram.

This results in negative 20.005 kilojoules.

The internal energy at state 2, U2, is negative 18.91689 kilojoules.

The specific internal energy at state 2, u2, is the internal energy at state 2, U2, divided by the mass, m, which equals negative 189.168 kilojoules per kilogram.

The fraction of ice at state 2, denoted as xEis,2, is calculated as the specific internal energy at state 2, u2, minus the specific internal energy at the melting point at state 1, uF1, divided by the difference between the specific internal energy at the melting point and the specific internal energy at the freezing point at state 1, uFC minus uF1, which equals approximately 0.5672.
