Delta E equals the sum of Q from 1 to 2 minus the sum of W from v, 1 to 2.

W equals the integral from 1 to 2 of p dV, which equals p_gas times the difference of V_2 minus V_1.

V_2 equals mRT_2 over p, which equals 3.42 times 10 to the power of negative 3 times R times 273.153 divided by 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5, which equals 0.01110 cubic meters, approximately 1.11 liters.

This implies W equals 1.1 times 10 to the power of 5 times the sum of 1.11 times 10 to the power of negative 3 plus 3.11 times 10 to the power of negative 3, which equals 594.843.

Delta E equals c_v times the difference of T_2 minus T_1.

This equals 0.633 watt-seconds per kilogram Kelvin times the difference of 273.153 minus 773.15.

This equals negative 316 watt-seconds per gram, which implies Delta E times m.

This implies Q from 1 to 2 equals Delta E plus W.
