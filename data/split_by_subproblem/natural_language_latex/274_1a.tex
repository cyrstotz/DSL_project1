a) Q out

- In a stationary 1HS: zero equals mass flow rate times the difference of enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entry plus the sum of Q. 
  \[
  Q equals mass flow rate times the difference of enthalpy at entry and enthalpy at exit.
  \]
  \[
  Q_{out} equals mass flow rate times the quantity of specific heat capacity times the difference of temperature T2 and T1 plus psi times the difference of pressure p2 and p1, under the condition that it equals zero, hence constant.
  \]
  \[
  According to Table A1: Q equals mass flow rate times the difference of enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entry.
  \]
  \[
  Enthalpy at entry equals 2333.8.
  \]
  \[
  Enthalpy at exit equals 2957.0.
  \]
  \[
  Q_{loss} equals negative 23.04 kilojoules.

a) Change in mass m12

Semi-open system
\[
The derivative with respect to time equals mass flow rate times the difference of enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entry plus the sum of heat flow rate times the ratio of change in mass i to mass i.
\]

\[
m12 minus mu1 equals heat flow rate Q_R12 plus change in mass m12 times enthalpy h12.
\]

\[
The ratio of mass flow rate times the difference of internal energy u12 minus u12 minus heat flow rate Q_R12 to enthalpy h12 equals change in mass m12.
\]

\[
At ambient temperature T_a0, according to A2:
\]
\[
z1: Temperature T_R equals 100 degrees Celsius.
\]
\[
z2: Temperature T_R equals 70 degrees Celsius.
\]

\[
Entry temperature T_ein12 equals 20 degrees Celsius.
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
Internal energy u_a2 & equals 418.94. \\
Internal energy u_R2 & equals 252.95.
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
Enthalpy h12 equals 83.96.
\]

\[
Change in mass from 1 to 2 equals negative 5052.79 grams, which is not possible.
