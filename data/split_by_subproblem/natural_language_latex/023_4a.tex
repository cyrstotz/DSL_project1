Graph 1: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled p and the horizontal axis labeled T. The graph shows a curve that starts at the bottom left, oscillates up and down several times, and then curves downwards to the right.

Graph 2: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled p and the horizontal axis labeled T. There are two lines: one labeled "Gas, solid" which is a straight line starting from the origin and going upwards to the right, and another line labeled "liquid" which starts from a point on the first line and goes downwards to the right. There is a point labeled T on the first line, and a region labeled "liquid" below the second line.

T_i equals PR: Lambda bar.

T_i equals negative 10 degrees Celsius.

The efficiency epsilon_k is equal to the ratio of the useful power output dot W_nutz to the input heat rate dot Q_zu.
