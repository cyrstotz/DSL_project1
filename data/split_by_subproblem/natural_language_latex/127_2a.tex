The graph is described as a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram with the y-axis labeled as 'p' and the x-axis labeled as 'v'. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 25, and the x-axis does not have specific numerical values marked. The graph features several curves:
- There are three isobaric lines labeled as 'p_0', 'p_5', and 'p_213' from left to right.
- Two isentropic lines labeled as "isentrop" run vertically.
- Six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are connected by lines to form a cycle.
- The points are connected in the following manner: point 0 to point 1 with a vertical line, point 1 to point 2 with a diagonal line, point 2 to point 3 with a vertical line, point 3 to point 4 with a diagonal line, point 4 to point 5 with a vertical line, and point 5 to point 6 with a diagonal line.
