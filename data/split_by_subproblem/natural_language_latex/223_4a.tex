The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (p-T) diagram. The horizontal axis is labeled T (Temperature) and the vertical axis is labeled p (Pressure). There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, forming a quadrilateral. The points are connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process: from point 1 to point 2, from point 2 to point 3, from point 3 to point 4, and from point 4 back to point 1.
