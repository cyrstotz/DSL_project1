The graph described is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as T in Kelvin and the y-axis is labeled as P in bar. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected by arrows indicating a cycle. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is directly above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, and point 4 is directly below point 3. The cycle proceeds in the order from point 1 to point 2, then to point 3, to point 4, and back to point 1. The pressure at point 1 is labeled as 5 bar, and the temperature at point 3 is labeled as 3i.
