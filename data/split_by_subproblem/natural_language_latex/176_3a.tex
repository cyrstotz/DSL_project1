The change in energy, denoted as Delta E, equals the product of the mass m and the difference in internal energy between states 2 and 1. This is given by the heat transferred per unit mass, Q12 over m, assuming the volume does not change.

The heat transferred, Q12, is 1.5 kilojoules.

The internal energy at state 1, u1, is calculated using the internal energy at 0 degrees Celsius, uf(0 degrees Celsius), plus 0.6 times the difference between the internal energy at the phase equilibrium at 0 degrees Celsius, ufe(0 degrees Celsius), and uf(0 degrees Celsius). This calculation results in -200.093 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy at state 2, u2, is the sum of the heat transferred per unit mass, Q12 over m, and the internal energy at state 1, u1. This results in -185.093 kilojoules per kilogram.

The temperature at state 2, Tg2, is 0.003 degrees Celsius.

The internal energy at state 2, u2, is set to equal -185.093, which is calculated using the internal energy at 0.003 degrees Celsius, uf(0.003 degrees Celsius), plus x2 times the difference between the internal energy at the phase equilibrium at 0.003 degrees Celsius, ufe(0.003 degrees Celsius), and uf(0.003 degrees Celsius). This results in x2 equaling approximately 0.555.
