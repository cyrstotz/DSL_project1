The graph is a phase diagram with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The graph consists of three main regions: liquid, gas, and a region labeled "wet steam". The liquid region is on the left side of the graph, the gas region is on the right side, and the "wet steam" region is in the middle, forming a dome shape. The boundaries between these regions are curved lines. The left boundary curves upwards from the origin, separating the liquid region from the "wet steam" region. The right boundary curves upwards from the origin, separating the gas region from the "wet steam" region. The top of the dome is labeled "critical point". The horizontal axis is labeled \( T \) and the vertical axis is labeled \( p \). The text "test" appears twice, once near the left boundary and once near the right boundary, but it is crossed out.
