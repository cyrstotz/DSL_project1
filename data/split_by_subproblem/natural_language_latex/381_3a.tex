Energy system:
Change in energy, Delta E, equals heat added, Q_zu, minus work, W, which leads to incompressible.
The mass of the energy system at state 2 minus the mass of the energy system at state 1 equals the heat added, Q_zu.
Internal energy at state 1, U_1, at x_1 equals 0.6 times 100 degrees Celsius equals u_p plus 0.6 times (u_fest minus u_p),
equals negative 333.458 plus 0.6 times 0.002,
equals negative 132.733 [unit].
