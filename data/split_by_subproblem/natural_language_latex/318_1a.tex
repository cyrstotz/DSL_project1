The equations are as follows:

1. The mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry plus the heat transfer rate equals zero.
2. The mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry plus the heat transfer rate R equals the heat transfer rate out, which is 62.18 kilowatts.

Additionally:

- The enthalpy at exit is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The enthalpy at entry is 419.09 kilojoules per kilogram.
