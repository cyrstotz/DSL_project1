Change in energy, denoted as Delta E, equals change in internal energy, Delta U, which is equal to Q with subscript 2Delta minus work done, W. This is further expanded as Q with subscript 2Delta minus the integral of pressure p with respect to volume dV, which equals Q with subscript 2Delta minus R over average R times the difference in temperature from T1 to T2.

Average R subscript g is calculated as 8.314 divided by 50 times 10 to the power of negative 3, which equals 166.28, and this is equal to c subscript p minus c subscript v.

Q with subscript 2Delta equals Delta U plus the integral of pressure p with respect to volume dV, which is further expanded as m subscript g times the integral from T1 to T2 of c subscript v with respect to temperature dT plus the integral of pressure p with respect to volume dV. This results in m subscript g times c subscript v times the difference in temperature from T1 to T2 plus p with subscript 3Delta times the difference in volume from V1 to V2.

V2 is calculated as m subscript g times average R subscript g times T with subscript g,2 divided by p with subscript 3Delta, resulting in 0.60 plus 0.103 cubic meters.

Q with subscript 2Delta equals negative 1.0827 kilojoules minus 0.2853 kilojoules, which results in negative 1.3673 kilojoules.
