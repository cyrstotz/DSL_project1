The internal energy at the first equilibrium state, denoted as U_{1EW}, is equal to the internal energy at the conditions of 3 bar and 0 degrees Celsius. 
U_{1EW} is expressed as the sum of the internal energy of the solid phase plus the fraction of ice times the internal energy of the liquid phase plus the fraction of ice times the difference between the internal energy of the solid and liquid phases.
The value of U_{1EW} is given as negative 200.0928.
The product of the mass of water and the difference between the internal energy at the second equilibrium state and the first equilibrium state equals the heat transferred, denoted as Q_k.
The internal energy at the second equilibrium state, U_{2EW}, is calculated as the ratio of the heat transferred to the mass of water plus the internal energy at the first equilibrium state.
The value of U_{2EW} is given as negative 191.6.
Equating negative 191.6 to the sum of negative 0.033 plus the fraction of ice times the difference between negative 333.442 and 0.033.
The fraction of ice at the second equilibrium state, x_{Eis_2}, is calculated to be approximately 0.575.
