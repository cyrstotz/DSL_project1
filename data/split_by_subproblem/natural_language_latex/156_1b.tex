The formula for T_KF is given by the ratio of the integral of T dS from S1 to S2 to the difference S2 minus S1, which equals the ratio of the integral of T dS from T1 to T2 to the integral from T1 to T2 of c_if times dT over T, which simplifies further to the ratio of the integral of T dS from T1 to T2 to c_if times the natural logarithm of T2 over T1. This expression simplifies to the ratio of T2 minus T1 to the natural logarithm of T2 over T1, which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
