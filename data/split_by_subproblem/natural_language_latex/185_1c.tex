The content includes two mathematical expressions arranged in a specific format:

1. The first expression is a matrix with two columns. The first column contains two rows, each with the term "m dot subscript N". The second column is a bordered matrix with two rows and two columns:
   - The first row contains the terms "Q dot subscript 'aus'" and "m dot subscript 2 h subscript 2".
   - The second row contains the terms "m dot subscript 1 h subscript 1" repeated in both columns.

2. The second expression is an equation:
   - It starts with negative "S dot subscript 'EZ'" equals "m dot subscript N" times the difference "(s dot subscript 2 minus s dot subscript 1)" plus "m dot subscript F" times the difference "(s dot subscript 3 minus s dot subscript 2)" plus "Q dot subscript 26" divided by "T bar subscript 'KF'", which implies "Q dot subscript 'aus'".
