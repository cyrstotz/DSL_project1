The average temperature T-bar is given by the formula:

T-bar equals the integral from T-entry to T-exit of T ds, divided by s-a minus s-e, which simplifies to the average of T-exit and T-entry, divided by 2.

Substituting the values, T-bar equals (298.15 plus 288.15) Kelvin divided by 2, which equals 293.15 Kelvin.
