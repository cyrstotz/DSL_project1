The change in entropy, Delta S, is equal to m2 times s2 minus m1 times s1. This can be rewritten as m1 times the difference of s2 and s1 plus Delta m dot times s2.

s1 is obtained from Table A-2 at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius and is equal to 1.306 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

s2 is obtained from Table A-2 at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius and is equal to 0.958 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The change in entropy, Delta S, is calculated to be 1411.88 kilojoules per Kelvin.
