There is a graph with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph contains three blue curves, each representing different isobars. There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 connected by black lines. The points are connected in the following order: from point 0 to point 1, from point 1 to point 2, from point 2 to point 3, from point 3 to point 4, and from point 4 to point 5. The point 0 is at the bottom left, point 1 is slightly above and to the right of point 0, point 2 is further to the right and slightly above point 1, point 3 is above point 2, point 4 is to the right of point 3, and point 5 is below point 4. The points 0, 1, and 2 lie on the first isobar, points 3 and 4 lie on the second isobar, and point 5 lies on the third isobar. There is an arrow pointing upwards from point 0 labeled "reversible adiabate".
