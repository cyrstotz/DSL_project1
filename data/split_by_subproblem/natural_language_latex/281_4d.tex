The energy efficiency, denoted as E_u, is equal to the absolute value of Q_zu divided by the difference between the absolute values of Q_ab and Q_zu, which is also equal to the absolute value of Q_zu dot divided by the absolute value of W_u dot. From the equation zero equals m dot times the difference of h_2 and h_1 plus Q_u dot.

It simplifies to the ratio of Q_u dot over W_u dot, which equals the ratio of m_RT12 dot times the difference of h_1 and h_2 over W_u dot.
