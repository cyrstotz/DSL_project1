Temperature T at state 2, experiment 1 is 0 degrees Celsius.
Pressure p at experiment 1, state 2 is 1.4 bar.

Mass calculation:
Volume V at experiment water, state 2 equals volume at experiment water, state 1.

X equals the fraction (U1 minus U_E) over (U2 minus U_E).

(crossed out section)

c of T equals c_v.
c of T2 minus c of T1 equals (T2 minus T1) times c_v.
c times t of T1 equals c times t of T which implies U2 is approximately equal to U1.

Fluid solution:
U2 equals U_E plus 0.6 times (y minus U_E) equals negative c times 0.6 plus 0.6 times (negative 33.3 MegaPascals times 0.04) equals negative 200.053 Joules per kilogram.

The above and below.
