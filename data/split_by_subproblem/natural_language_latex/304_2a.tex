The graph described is a T-s diagram, where the x-axis is labeled 's' and the y-axis is labeled 'T'. It features two curves: one originates from point O and curves upwards to the right, while the other also starts from point O but curves upwards to the left. The points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the graph. The path on the graph progresses from point O to point 1, then moves vertically up to point 2, diagonally up to point 3, horizontally to point 4, diagonally down to point 5, and finally vertically down to point 6. Additionally, the points p1 and p2 are indicated on the upper curve, and point p0 is marked on the lower curve.
