The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as entropy 's' in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled as temperature 'T' in Kelvin. There are three isobars shown as dashed lines, and the region between two isobars is labeled as "Isobars". There is a closed cycle with four points labeled as '1', '2', '3', and '4'. The cycle starts at point '1', moves to point '2', then to point '3', and finally back to point '1'. Point '1' is at the intersection of the lowest isobar and the y-axis. Point '2' is at a higher entropy and temperature than point '1'. Point '3' is at a higher temperature but the same entropy as point '2'. Point '4' is at the same temperature as point '1' but at a higher entropy.
