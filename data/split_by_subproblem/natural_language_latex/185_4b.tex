The mass flow rate, denoted by m dot, is considered for the entire system only through energy equations. The rate of kinetic energy, denoted by W_k dot, equals the mass flow rate m dot multiplied by k times the specific volume energy ev. The rate of electrical work, denoted by W_el dot, equals the integral from 1 to 2 of velocity v with respect to pressure dp. The mass flow rate m dot equals the rate of kinetic energy W_k dot divided by the electrical work W_el. For temperature change, denoted by Delta U, it equals heat q minus work W.
