The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between two points, plus the sum of heat transfer rates minus the sum of work rates.

The change in energy is equal to the change in mass between two points times the difference in enthalpy between those two points.

The change in energy is equal to the change in internal energy, which is the internal energy at point two minus the internal energy at point one.

This implies that the change in mass between two points is equal to the difference in specific internal energy between two points divided by the difference in enthalpy between those two points, which equals the specific heat capacity times the difference in temperature between two points divided by the specific heat capacity times the negative difference in temperature between those two points, which results in infinity.
