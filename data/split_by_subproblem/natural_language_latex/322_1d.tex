Energy Balance from state 1 to state 2:
The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum of the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy, kinetic energy per unit mass, and potential energy per unit mass, plus the sum of heat transfer rates minus the sum of work rates.

This implies that the rate of change of internal energy from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the mass at state 1 times the enthalpy at state 1 minus the mass at state 2 times the enthalpy at state 2 plus the heat added.

This further implies that the mass flow rate into the system times the difference in specific internal energy between state 1 and state 2 is equal to the mass at state 1 times the enthalpy at state 1 minus the mass at state 2 times the enthalpy at state 2 plus the heat added.

Therefore, the mass flow rate into the system is equal to the numerator, which is the mass at state 1 times the enthalpy at state 1 minus the mass at state 2 times the enthalpy at state 2 plus the heat added, divided by the difference in specific internal energy between state 1 and state 2.

This can also be expressed as the mass flow rate into the system is equal to the sum of the mass at state 1 times the enthalpy at state 1 minus the mass at state 2 times the enthalpy at state 2 and the heat added, all divided by the difference in specific internal energy between state 1 and state 2.
