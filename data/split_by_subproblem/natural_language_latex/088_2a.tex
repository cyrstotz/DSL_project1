A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as S in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin. The graph consists of a curve starting from point 0, moving to point 1, then to point 2, and finally to point 3. The segment from point 0 to point 1 is labeled as "isentrop". The segment from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "isobar". The segment from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "isobar". The segment from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "isobar". The segment from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "isobar". The segment from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "isobar". The segment from point 4 to point 0 is labeled as "isobar".
