The average temperature T-bar is given by the equation T-bar equals the integral from S_e to S_a of T dS divided by S_a minus S_e.

The integral from S_e to S_a of T dS equals Q because pressure p is constant.

S_a star minus S_e equals the integral from T_AE to T_A of c_p of T divided by T dT.

This equals c_p of T times the natural logarithm of T evaluated from T_AE to T_A.

The equation ends with an equals sign, indicating continuation or further steps not provided.
