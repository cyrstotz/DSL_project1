Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance, plus the heat transfer rate at the exit divided by the temperature at the exit, minus the heat transfer rate out divided by 295 Kelvin, plus the generated entropy rate. This implies that the generated entropy rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit, plus the heat transfer rate divided by 100 degrees Celsius, plus the heat transfer rate out divided by 295 Kelvin. This equals 0.3 times the difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit, minus the heat transfer rate times 1000 divided by the sum of 100 and 273.15, plus negative 62.182 times 1000 divided by 295 Kelvin.

The difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit is given as follows: the entropy at the entrance at 100 degrees Celsius is 1.30669 times 1000 Joules per kilogram Kelvin, and the entropy at the exit at 70 degrees Celsius is 0.9549 times 1000 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.

This results in negative 0.373 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
