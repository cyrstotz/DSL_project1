b) Polytropic equation:

The ratio of T6 over T5 equals the ratio of p6 over p5 raised to the power of (K minus 1) divided by K, which implies that T6 equals 328.075 Kelvin.

The rate of change of E0 with respect to time equals the sum of the mass flow rate times (enthalpy i plus kinetic energy i plus potential energy i0) plus the sum of heat flow minus the sum of work flow.

Zero equals the total mass flow rate times (enthalpy at 5 minus enthalpy at 6 plus kinetic energy at 5 minus kinetic energy at 6).

Zero equals the total mass flow rate times (specific heat at constant pressure times (T6 minus T5) plus one half times 220 squared minus one half times w6 squared).

This implies that w6 equals 249.525 meters per second.
