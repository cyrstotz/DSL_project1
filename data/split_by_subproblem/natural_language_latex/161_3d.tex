The efficiency of the compressor, denoted as epsilon K, is equal to the absolute value of Q sol divided by the absolute value of the dot product of W kl.

The absolute value of Q sol is equal to the dot product of m ex multiplied by the difference between h n3 and h n1.

h 2 is equal to h g at 8 bar, which is equal to g 2 times u 2 times the ratio of R to g.

s 2 is equal to s 3, and s 2 is also equal to s g at T i minus 6 degrees Celsius.

x 3 is equal to the fraction where the numerator is s 2 minus s f at 8 bar, and the denominator is the difference between s g at 8 bar and s f at 8 bar.

h 3 is equal to h f at 8 bar plus x times the difference between h g at 8 bar and h f at 8 bar.
