The change in existing exergy, denoted as Delta e subscript ex, ist, is equal to the expression in parentheses: h subscript c minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times the difference of s subscript 6 and s subscript 0, plus one half times w subscript 6 squared minus one half times w subscript 0 squared. This expression simplifies to c subscript p times the difference of T subscript G and T subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times c subscript p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T subscript G over T subscript 0, plus one half times w subscript 6 squared minus one half times w subscript 0 squared. The value of Delta e subscript ex, ist is 165.17 kilojoules per kilogram.

Additionally, T subscript G is given as 310 Kelvin, and w subscript 6 is 510 meters per second.
