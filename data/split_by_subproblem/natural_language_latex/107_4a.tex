Graph Description:

The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled "Temperature [Â°C]" and the y-axis labeled "Pressure [bar]". The x-axis runs horizontally and the y-axis runs vertically. The graph contains two curves. The first curve starts at the origin (0,0), rises steeply, and then levels off before rising steeply again. The second curve branches off from the first curve at a certain point and rises more steeply than the first curve.
