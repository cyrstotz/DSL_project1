A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as S in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgK) and the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin (K). There are three curves on the graph labeled as P0, P2/P3, and P5 from left to right. Six points are marked on the graph and connected with lines:

- Point 0 is located on the leftmost curve labeled P0.
- Point 1 is slightly above and to the right of Point 0 on the same curve.
- Point 2 is located on the middle curve labeled P2/P3 and is connected to Point 1.
- Point 3 is above Point 2 on the same curve.
- Point 4 is on the rightmost curve labeled P5 and is connected to Point 3.
- Point 5 is below Point 4 on the same curve.
- Point 6 is on the leftmost curve labeled P0 and is connected to Point 5.
