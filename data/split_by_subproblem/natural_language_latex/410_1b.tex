The average temperature T_EF is given by the equation:
T_EF bar equals the integral from S_e to S_a of T dS, divided by S_a minus S_e.

For an ideal fluid:

S_a minus S_e equals the integral from T_in to T_out of c_p prime of T over T dT.

The adiabatic process constant PKF_adi equals the input process constant PKF_in, which implies that the process is isobaric plus adiabatic equals reversible equals isentropic.

The average temperature T_EF is calculated as the average of T_EF,old and T_EF,in, which equals 293.15 Kelvin.
