The expressions are as follows:

- \( P_{S1} \) and \( M_{g} \)

- \( P_{S1} \) equals \( P_{0} \) plus the fraction of \( (m_{k} + m_{ew}) \times g \) over \( \pi \) times the square of \( \frac{d}{2} \), which equals 1.4 bar underlined.

- \( m_{g} \) equals the fraction of \( P_{S1} \times V_{S1} \) over \( R \times T_{S1} \), which equals 5.29 grams underlined.

- \( R \) equals \( \overline{R} \) over \( M_{g} \), which equals 166.28 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.
