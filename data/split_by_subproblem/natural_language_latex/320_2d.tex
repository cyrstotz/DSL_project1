The equations are as follows:

1. The rate of exergy destruction, denoted as dot e subscript x, ver, equals T subscript 0 times dot s subscript gen times dot s subscript ver.

2. Zero equals q subscript B divided by T subscript B plus dot s subscript ver.

3. The rate of entropy generation for ice, denoted as dot s subscript ice, equals q subscript B divided by T subscript B, which equals 1105 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 1298 Kelvin, resulting in 0.927 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

4. The rate of exergy destruction, denoted as dot e subscript x, ver, equals 303.15 Kelvin times 0.927 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, which equals 281 kilowatts.
