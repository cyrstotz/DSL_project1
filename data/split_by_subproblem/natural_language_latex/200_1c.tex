The average temperature T2 is 293.72 Kelvin.

Graphical description: There is a horizontal line with an upward arrow labeled Q dot out (heat flow out) pointing upwards from the line. Below this line, there is another horizontal line with an upward arrow labeled Q dot out pointing upwards from the line. To the right of these lines, there is a handwritten note: S dot generated equals Q dot out divided by 293.72.

The temperature T1 is 70 degrees Celsius, which is equal to 373.15 Kelvin.

The equation is zero equals m dot times (he minus ha) plus Q dot out divided by T2 minus Q dot out divided by T1 equals S dot generated.

S dot generated equals Q dot out times (1 divided by T2 minus 1 divided by T1).

This equals 62.182 kilowatts per Kelvin, which is boxed as 45.497 watts per Kelvin.
