Stationary flow process around mass in the reactor:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, minus the heat flow rate out plus the heat flow rate due to reaction.

This implies that the heat flow rate out equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat flow rate due to reaction.

The enthalpy at the inlet at 700 degrees Celsius equals the enthalpy of fluid at 100 degrees Celsius times 1 plus the difference between the enthalpy of gas at 700 degrees Celsius and the enthalpy of fluid at 700 degrees Celsius.

Using Table A-2:

Equals 292.98 plus 0.005 times (2626.8 minus 232.98).

Equals 304.65 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at the outlet at 1000 degrees Celsius equals the enthalpy of fluid at 1000 degrees Celsius times 1 plus the difference between the enthalpy of gas at 1000 degrees Celsius and the enthalpy of fluid at 1000 degrees Celsius.

Using Table A-2:

Equals 429.04 plus 0.005 times (2676.1 minus 419.04).

Equals 430.33 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat flow rate out equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 304.65 kilojoules per kilogram and 430.33 kilojoules per kilogram, plus 100 kilowatts.

Equals
