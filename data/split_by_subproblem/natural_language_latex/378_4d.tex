d) The specific heat transfer rate, q_K, is equal to the heat transfer rate, dot Q_K, divided by the total volume flow rate, dot V_t, which equals dot Q_K divided by 28W.

The rate of change of heat transfer, dot Q_K, is given by the derivative of dot T with respect to T, which equals the mass flow rate, dot m, times the difference in enthalpy h_2 minus h_1, plus the heat transfer rate dot Q_2v, minus the ratio of the volume flow rate dot V_v over the volume V.

The heat transfer rate dot Q_2v is equal to the mass flow rate, dot m, times the difference in enthalpy h_2 minus h_1.

Therefore, the efficiency epsilon_K is equal to the mass flow rate, dot m, times the difference in enthalpy h_2 minus h_1, divided by 28W.
