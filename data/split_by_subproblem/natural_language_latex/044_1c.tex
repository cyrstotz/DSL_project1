Fine: The temperature \( T_{EF} \) is 255 Kelvin given that \( T_w \) is 100 degrees Celsius plus 273.15 Kelvin.

Entropy:

Closure: The system remains as before.

The rate of change of entropy \( \frac{dS}{dt} \) is equal to the heat flow rate \( \dot{Q}_{zu} \) divided by the temperature \( T_{EF} \), plus the heat flow rate \( \dot{Q}_{zu} \) divided by the temperature \( T_w \), plus the incoming entropy \( S_{zu} \).

Where \( T_w \) is 100 degrees Celsius.

The incoming entropy \( S_{zu} \) is equal to the heat flow rate \( \dot{Q}_{zu} \) times the sum of the reciprocals of the temperatures \( T_{zu} \) and \( T_{KF} \).

This results in \( S_{zu} \) being equal to 0.04615 kilowatts per Kelvin.
