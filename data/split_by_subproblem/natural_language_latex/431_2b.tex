From step 5 to 6, the process is isentropic, which implies that the change in entropy, delta s, equals zero.

The equation zero equals c_p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_6 to T_5 minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p_6 to p_5 is given.

The efficiency eta is defined as the ratio of c_p to c_v, leading to the expression for c_v as c_p divided by eta, which equals 0.7186 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

The gas constant R is calculated as c_p minus c_v, resulting in 0.2874 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

The temperature T_6 is calculated using the formula T_5 times the exponential of the fraction R over c_p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p_6 to p_5.

The calculated temperature T_6 is 328.084 Kelvin.

The equation zero equals the mass flow rate dot m times the quantity h_5 minus h_6 plus half the difference of w_5 squared and w_6 squared plus dot Q minus dot W equals zero is provided.

The velocity w_6 is calculated using the square root of twice h_5 minus twice h_6 plus w_5 squared minus the square root of twice the quantity c_p times the difference T_5 minus T_6 plus w_5 squared.

The calculated velocity w_6 is 507.25 meters per second.
