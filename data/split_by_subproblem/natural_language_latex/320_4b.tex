The mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, equals the kinetic power, denoted as W dot subscript k, divided by the difference between h subscript 2 and h subscript 3.

Zero equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference between h subscript 3 and h subscript 2, minus the kinetic power, W dot subscript k.
