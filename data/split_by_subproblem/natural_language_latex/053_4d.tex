The rate of heat input minus the rate of heat output equals the rate of useful work. The rate of heat input equals the rate of heat output. The total heat transfer, Q, equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 4 and state 1 plus the rate of heat input. The rate of heat input equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 1. This is equal to 658.43 kilojoules per second. This is also equal to the difference in enthalpy between state i2 and state 3 divided by 1000. This difference in enthalpy is calculated as 237.62 kilojoules per kilogram minus 33.42 kilojoules per kilogram per second.

From Table A11:
The pressure at state 3 equals the pressure at state 2, which is 8 bar. The enthalpy at state u2 equals the enthalpy at the fluid state at 8 bar, which is 33.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
