Shear Force Diagram: 0

The rate of change of energy with respect to time equals the sum of the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy and half the velocity squared for the outgoing minus the sum of the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy and half the velocity squared for the incoming plus the rate of heat transfer minus the sum of the rate of work.

The mass flow rate times the sum of the initial enthalpy and half the initial velocity squared equals the mass flow rate times the sum of the enthalpy at stage 6 and half the velocity squared at stage 6 plus the rate of heat transfer equals zero.

The initial enthalpy minus the enthalpy at stage 6 plus half the initial velocity squared minus half the velocity squared at stage 6 plus the rate of heat transfer equals zero.

Half the initial velocity squared equals the specific heat capacity times the difference in temperature from initial to stage 6 plus half the velocity squared at stage 6 plus the rate of heat transfer.

The initial velocity equals the square root of twice the sum of the specific heat capacity times the temperature difference from initial to stage 6 plus half the velocity squared at stage 6 plus the heat transfer, which equals 1503 meters per second.
