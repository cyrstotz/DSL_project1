The rate of entropy generation for the system, denoted as S dot subscript er, equals the sum of the rate of entropy generation for the cooler, denoted as S dot subscript Kuper, and the rate of entropy generation for the reactor without shutdown, denoted as S dot subscript Reaktor, oSz.

The rate of entropy generation for the cooler in the system, denoted as S dot subscript KF, er, equals S subscript 2 minus S subscript 1 minus Q divided by T subscript KF.

The rate of entropy generation for the reactor without shutdown, denoted as S dot subscript Reaktor, oSz, equals negative Q dot divided by T plus m dot times the difference between S subscript 2 and S subscript 1, which equals 4.25 Watts per Kelvin.

S subscript 1 equals S subscript f equals 0.8549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

S subscript 2 equals S subscript f equals 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

T equals T subscript Reaktor equals 100 degrees Celsius.

Q dot equals Q dot subscript R plus Q dot subscript aus.
