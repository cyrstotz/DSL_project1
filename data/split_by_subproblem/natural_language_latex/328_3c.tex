Energy Balance:
For a closed system, the change in energy, Delta E, is equal to E0 minus E1 minus the sum of Q minus the sum of dot W. The mass at E0 is 0.6 kilograms minus 0.6 kilograms, and the mass at W0 is 0.4 kilograms minus 0.4 kilograms, which equals the mass of 2H2 minus the mass of CH.

Turning it around:
Delta E equals the fraction of E2 minus E1 plus the sum of Q minus the sum of dot W over i. This equals m_g1 times U2 minus U1 plus Q12, which equals m_g1 times c_v times T2 minus T1 equals Q. This results in 3.429 times 0.633 times (500 minus 0.003) times 10 raised to the power of 5.273 equals Q12.
