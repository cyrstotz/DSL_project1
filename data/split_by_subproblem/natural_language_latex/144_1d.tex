For the first equation:
The change in energy rate, Delta dot E, equals the product of mass flow rate from state 1 to 2, dot m subscript 12, and specific enthalpy at entry, dot h subscript ein, plus the heat transfer rate from state 1 to 2, dot Q subscript 12.

For the second equation:
The change in energy rate, Delta dot E, equals the sum of the product of mass flow rate i, dot m subscript i, and the sum of specific enthalpy i, h subscript i, plus half the square of velocity c subscript i, plus the product of gravitational acceleration g and height z subscript i, summed over all i, plus the sum of heat transfer rates, sum dot Q, minus the sum of work rates input, sum dot W subscript in.

For the third equation:
The product of mass flow rate from state 1 to 2, dot m subscript 12, and specific internal energy at state 2, dot u subscript 2, minus the product of mass flow rate from state 1 to 2, dot m subscript 12, and specific internal energy at state 1, dot u subscript 1, equals the product of mass flow rate from state 1 to 2, dot m subscript 12, and specific enthalpy at entry, dot h subscript ein, plus the heat transfer rate from state 1 to 2, dot Q subscript 12.
