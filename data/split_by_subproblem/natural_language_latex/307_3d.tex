The change in energy, Delta E, equals E2 minus E1, which is the sum over j of Qj minus the sum of Wvh tending to zero, and this is less than the number of eigenvalues.

The product of the equivalent mass, meq, and the difference between u2 and u1 equals Q12, which is 1500 Joules.

The equivalent mass, meq, is 0.1 kilograms.

u2 equals uf evaluated at Tev2 and pev2 plus x2 times the difference between ug evaluated at Tev2 and pev2 minus uf.

u1 equals uf evaluated at Tev1 and pev1 plus x1 times the difference between ug evaluated at Tev1 and pev1 minus uf.
