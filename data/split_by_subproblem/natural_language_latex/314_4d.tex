The efficiency of the Carnot cycle, denoted as epsilon K, is equal to the ratio of the heat input rate, denoted as Q dot zu, to the positive work rate, denoted as W dot plus. This is also equal to the ratio of the absolute value of the heat input rate to the difference between the absolute value of the heat output rate and the absolute value of the heat input rate.
