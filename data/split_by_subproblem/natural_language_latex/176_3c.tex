The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to E2 minus E1, which is equal to m3alpha times u2 minus m3alpha times u1, and this equals Q minus Wv.

The temperatures are given as:
- Tgz is 0 degrees Celsius.
- T3alpha is 500 degrees Celsius.
- The change in internal energy per unit mass, u2 minus u1, is equal to cvpg times (T2 minus T1), which equals 316.5 Joules per kilogram.

The work done per unit mass, Wv over m, is equal to the gas constant R times (T2 minus T1) divided by (1 minus n).

Calculating Wv over m gives:
- Wv over m equals 0.16628 times 500 divided by (1 minus 1.263), which results in -316.5 Joules per kilogram.
- The system is frictionless, hence it is isentropic.
- The polytropic index n is calculated as (R plus cv) divided by cv, which equals 1.263.

This results in 316.5.
