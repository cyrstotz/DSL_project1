The graph is described as a simple Cartesian coordinate system. The vertical axis is labeled T in Kelvin, and the horizontal axis is labeled S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. There is an arrow on the horizontal axis pointing to the right, indicating the positive direction of S. There is also an arrow on the vertical axis pointing upwards, indicating the positive direction of T.
