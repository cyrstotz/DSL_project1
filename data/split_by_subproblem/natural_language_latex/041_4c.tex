The pressure \( p_4 \) equals \( p_3 \) which is 8 bar. The process is an adiabatic throttle, which implies it is isothermal, thus \( T_3 \) equals \( T_4 \). The quality \( X_4 \) equals 0, indicating that it is saturated at 8 bar. The temperature \( T_u \) is 31.33 degrees Celsius, according to TABA-11, and it is in the liquid-vapor state at 8 bar.
