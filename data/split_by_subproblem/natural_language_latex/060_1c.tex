The entropy balance equation is given as:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at condition c and the entropy at condition r, plus the sum of the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature for each i, plus the irreversible entropy generation rate.

This implies that the negative irreversible entropy generation rate equals 0.83 times the heat transfer rate at condition r divided by the temperature at condition r, which equals 399.36 divided by 293, resulting in 0.3380 kilojoules per Kelvin per second, which simplifies to 0.3380 kilojoules per Kelvin.
