The change in internal energy, Delta U, is equal to the change in mass from state 1 to 2, denoted as Delta m_12, multiplied by the enthalpy of entry, h_ein, minus the heat transfer from state 1 to 2, QR_12. This is equal to the mass at state 2, m_2, times the specific internal energy at state 2, u_2, minus the mass at state 1, m_1, times the specific internal energy at state 1, u_1.

The change in mass from state 1 to 2, Delta m_12, is equal to the mass at state 2, m_12, times the specific internal energy at state 2, u_2, minus the mass at state 1, m_1, times the specific internal energy at state 1, u_1, plus the heat transfer from state 1 to state 2, QR_12, all divided by the enthalpy of entry, h_ein.

In the table for a to z, the enthalpy of entry, h_ein, at 20 degrees Celsius is initially crossed out, indicating it is not used, and then it is stated that the enthalpy of fusion, h_f, at 20 degrees Celsius is 83.96 kilojoules per kilogram.

The specific internal energy at state 2, u_2, is not provided in the text.
