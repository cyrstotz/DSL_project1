The fraction of the rate of change of energy in the x-direction due to velocity, denoted as dot E sub x, vel, divided by mass m, equals the initial temperature T sub zero times the rate of change of displacement in the x-direction, denoted as dot s sub e, x, plus the energy in the x-direction due to velocity, denoted as e sub x, vel.
