State 1 in 65W!

Implies that the pressure at state gs equals the pressure at state gw.

Implies that the area at state pw equals the area at state panb plus the mass at state wg.

Area equals (0.1 meters squared) times pi.

Implies that the pressure at state gw equals the ratio of the area at state panb plus the mass at state bg over the area, which equals the ratio of (0.1 meters squared times pi times 10 to the power of 5 plus 32 times 9.81) over (0.1 meters squared times pi).

Equals 1.1 bar.

Implies that the pressure at state gs equals the pressure at state gw.

Implies that the area at state pg equals the area at state pw plus the mass at state EK times g. Implies that the pressure at state g equals the ratio of the area at state pw plus the mass at state EK times g over the area.

Equals 1.1 bar.

The mass at state g equals the ratio of the pressure at state g times the volume at state g over the product of the pressure at state g and the temperature at state g, which equals the ratio of 1.1 bar times 3.19 liters over (8.314 Joules per mole Kelvin times 773.15 Kelvin) equals 2.68 grams.
