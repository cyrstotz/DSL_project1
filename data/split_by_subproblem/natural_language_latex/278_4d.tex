The efficiency of K, denoted as epsilon subscript K, equals the ratio of Q subscript zu over dot W subscript K, which simplifies to 252.8 divided by 28, resulting in 9.28.

Q subscript zu equals dot m subscript R times the difference between h subscript 2 and h subscript 3, which calculates as 1.80 kilograms per second times (237.74 minus 93.42) kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in 258.8 kilowatts.
