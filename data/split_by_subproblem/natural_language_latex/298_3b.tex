b) T_{2,g} p_{2,g}?

The mass flow rate mÌ‡_{2,g} is greater than zero, which implies that it is at the front end.

The temperature T_{2,g} is exactly the equilibrium temperature of the ice-water mixture, hence T_{ew} equals 0 degrees Celsius, since thermal equilibrium has been reached (no more heat is flowing). The pressure p_{2,g} is also constant, as the expression remains constant due to the weight of the water-ice mixture and the ambient pressure.
