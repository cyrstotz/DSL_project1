The equation for T is given by the integral of T ds from s_a to s_e, which equals the fraction (h_a minus h_e) divided by (s_a minus s_e). This is further equal to the fraction where the numerator is the product of dot Q superscript o times (T_aus minus T_ein) plus the product of dot V times (p_2 minus p_1), and the denominator is dot Q superscript o times the natural logarithm of (T_aus divided by T_ein). Simplifying this, we get the fraction (298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin) divided by the natural logarithm of (298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin), which equals 293.12 Kelvin, denoted as T_uF.
