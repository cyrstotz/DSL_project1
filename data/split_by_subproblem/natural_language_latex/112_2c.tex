The local error change in x direction, denoted as delta e subscript x, istr, loc, is equal to the sum of delta e subscript x, istr, 10A plus the cancelled term delta e subscript x, istr, 10A, plus delta e subscript x, istr, 14A, plus the cancelled term delta e subscript x, istr, 10A minus 5A.

The total mass flow rate, denoted as dot m subscript ges, times dot m subscript in, equals dot m subscript in, which equals dot m subscript in, which equals 5.233 times dot m subscript in minus dot m subscript ges, which equals 6.233 times dot m subscript in.

Therefore, the local error change in x direction, delta e subscript x, istr, loc, equals the cancelled term of dot m subscript in times the quantity T subscript 0 times (s subscript 5 minus s subscript 0) plus one half times (w subscript 5 squared minus w subscript 0 squared) plus h.

The enthalpy at state 6, denoted as h subscript 6, equals the enthalpy at state 0, h subscript 0, minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus one half times (w subscript 2 squared minus w subscript 0 squared).

The difference in enthalpy between state 6 and state 0, h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0, equals the specific heat at constant pressure, c subscript p, times (T subscript 0 minus T subscript 6); and the difference in entropy between state 6 and state 0, s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0, equals the specific heat at constant pressure, c subscript p, times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T subscript 6 to T subscript 0 minus the gas constant, R, times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p subscript 6 to p subscript 0.
