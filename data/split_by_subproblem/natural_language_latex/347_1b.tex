The integral of dot Q over T equals the integral of dot Q over T plus the integral of dot Q over T.

For an ideal fluid, this implies a wavy line, which implies that s(T/p) equals s(T).

For an ideal fluid, T equals the average of T_out minus T_in, which implies that T_in equals 289.15 Kelvin, and the average of 259.15 Kelvin and 293.15 Kelvin equals 293.15 Kelvin.
