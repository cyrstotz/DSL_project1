a) Stationary Flow Process

The first equation is zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in entropy at the exit and the entrance plus the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature plus the generated entropy rate.

The second equation is zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy at the exit and the entrance plus the heat transfer rate out minus the work done in, since the process is isobaric.

The third equation states that the heat transfer rate out equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy at the entrance and the exit.

The fourth equation expresses the difference in enthalpy between the entrance and the exit as the product of the isentropic fluid capacity times the difference in temperatures between the second entrance temperature and the exit temperature plus half the velocity squared times the difference in pressures between the second entrance pressure and the first entrance pressure.

The fifth equation states that the second entrance pressure equals the entrance pressure.

The sixth equation states that the heat transfer rate out equals the mass flow rate times the isentropic fluid capacity times the difference in temperatures between the cooling temperature at the entrance and the first cooling temperature at the exit.
