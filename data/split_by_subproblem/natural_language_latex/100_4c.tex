Part c:

- The value of p_vk equals p_1, which is 1.2 times 10, and T A 10.
- h_1 is equal to h_ey.
- x equals 1.2.
- h_u equals 95.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
- x equals the fraction (h_4 minus h_f) divided by (h_g minus h_f), which equals 0.3 or 0.39.

The statement in German translates to: "This would complicate what one is trying to modulate, as the heat is being removed, making it harder to transfer into the gas phase."
