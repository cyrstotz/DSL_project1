Heat transferability of the system, open, steady state. It only absorbs heat, ideal fluid.

The temperatures are given as:
- T_in equals 288.15 Kelvin
- T_out equals 293.15 Kelvin
- P_1 equals P_2

The rate of change of temperature T_dot is given by the formula:
T_dot equals Q_dot divided by (m_dot times c_p)
Lambda
The difference in entropy S(T_1) minus S(T_2) equals the integral from T_1 to T_2 of (c_p(T) divided by T) dT, assuming c_p is constant.

Therefore, T_dot equals (T_2 minus T_1) divided by the natural logarithm of (T_2 divided by T_1). The unit is kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
Considering the source capability as Q_dot, T_dot equals (293.15 minus 288.15 Kelvin) divided by the natural logarithm of (293.15 divided by 288.15), which approximately equals 293.12 Kelvin.
