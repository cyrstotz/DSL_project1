The derivative of mass flow rate with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between h2 and h3, plus the rate of heat transfer in the evaporator divided by the temperature in the evaporator, minus the rate of volume flow k.

h2 is defined as h of pf, hg, with s2 equal to s1.

h3 is defined as h of s3 equal to s2, at 8 bar.

The rate of volume flow k is equal to negative 28 Watts.
