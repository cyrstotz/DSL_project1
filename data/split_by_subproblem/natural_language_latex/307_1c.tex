The section is titled "Entropy Balance:"

The first equation is:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the inlet and the entropy at the outlet, plus the heat flow rate at the outlet divided by the mean temperature, plus the generated entropy rate.

The implication from the first equation leads to the second equation:
The generated entropy rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the outlet and the entropy at the inlet, minus the heat flow rate at the outlet divided by the mean temperature.

The final expression simplifies to:
The generated entropy rate equals the mass flow rate times the specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the outlet temperature to the inlet temperature, minus the heat flow rate at the outlet divided by the mean temperature.
