The equations are as follows:

1. The rate of heat input divided by the temperature of the cold reservoir plus the rate of entropy generation minus the rate of heat output divided by the temperature of the hot reservoir equals zero.

2. The rate of entropy generation equals the rate of heat output times the difference between the inverse of the temperature of the cold reservoir and the inverse of the temperature of the hot reservoir.

3. This is calculated as 62.33 kilowatts times the difference between the inverse of 293.17 Kelvin and the inverse of 373.15 Kelvin.

4. The rate of entropy generation equals 46 Joules.
