For item b):

The rate of change of kinetic energy, denoted as W-dot subscript K, equals 28 watts.

The pressure at state 3, denoted as p3, equals 8 bar.

Energy balance equation:

Zero equals the mass flow rate, denoted as m-dot, times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3, plus the heat transfer rate from state 2 to state 3, which leads to zero, indicating an adiabatic process.

The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3 equals the rate of kinetic energy divided by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3.

State 3 is in a liquid state as per Table 4, with a temperature T3 equal to 31.33 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy at state 3, denoted as h3, equals 93.62 kilojoules per kilogram, and the entropy at state 3, denoted as s3, equals 0.3459 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
