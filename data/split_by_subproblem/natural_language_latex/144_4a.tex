Graph Description: The graph is a plot on grid paper with the y-axis labeled as kilojoules per kilogram and the x-axis labeled as temperature in Kelvin. The graph consists of a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The region between points 1 and 2 is labeled as "Wet Steam". The curve from point 1 to point 2 is a rising curve, and from point 2 to point 3, it is a steeply rising curve. The curve from point 3 to point 4 is a horizontal line labeled "isobar". The curve from point 4 to point 1 is a falling curve labeled "isobar".
