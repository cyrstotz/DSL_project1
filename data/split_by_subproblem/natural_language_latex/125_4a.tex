Graph 1:
The graph is a plot with an x-axis labeled T and a y-axis labeled P. The plot shows a complex curve that starts from the origin, goes upwards, and then oscillates. Within this curve, there is a quadrilateral with vertices labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The quadrilateral is positioned such that:
- Vertex 1 is at the bottom left.
- Vertex 2 is at the top left.
- Vertex 3 is at the top right.
- Vertex 4 is at the bottom right.
The quadrilateral is drawn with straight lines connecting these vertices in the order 1-2-3-4-1.

Graph 2:
The second graph is a plot with an x-axis labeled T and a y-axis labeled P. The plot shows a curve that starts from the origin and rises upwards in a nonlinear fashion, indicating a phase boundary. The curve separates two regions:
- The region below the curve is labeled "solid".
- The region above the curve is labeled "gas/vapor".
There is a horizontal line labeled i that starts from a point on the y-axis and extends to the right, intersecting the curve. From the intersection point, a vertical line labeled ii extends downwards to the x-axis.
