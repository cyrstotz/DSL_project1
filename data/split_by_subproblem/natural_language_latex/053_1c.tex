The heat transfer Q is equal to the heat output Q_aus divided by the temperature of the reactor T_reaktor minus the heat output Q_aus divided by the temperature T_EF, leading to the entropy balance of the system affected by wind.

The total entropy rate S_tot is equal to the heat output Q_aus divided by the temperature T_EF minus the heat output Q_aus divided by the temperature of the reactor T_reaktor, which calculates to 654 kJ divided by 285 K minus 654 kJ divided by 373.15 K, resulting in 0.04615 kJ per K.
