Graph description: The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled T in degrees Kelvin and the x-axis labeled s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph consists of several points connected by lines, representing different states:

- Point 1 is at the origin.
- Point 2 is above and to the right of point 1.
- Point 3 is above and to the right of point 2, with a steeper slope.
- Point 4 is to the right of point 3, with a horizontal line.
- Point 5 is below point 4, with a vertical line.
- Point 6 is below and to the right of point 5, with a steep slope.

The points are connected in the following order: from point 1 to point 2, from point 2 to point 3, from point 3 to point 4, from point 4 to point 5, and from point 5 to point 6. There are labels indicating "isobar" and "isotherm" along the lines connecting the points.
