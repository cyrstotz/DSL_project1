The mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at point a (crossed out) and the enthalpy at point o minus the temperature at point o times the difference between the entropy at point 1 and point 6 plus the change in kinetic energy, all evaluated between points 1 and 2.

The temperature at point o is 243.15 Kelvin.

The change in exergy due to the stream is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at point e and the enthalpy at point s.

The mass flow rate times the sum of the enthalpy at point e and the enthalpy at point o minus the temperature at point o times the difference between the entropy at point 6 and the entropy at point o plus the kinetic energy at point e minus the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at point s and the enthalpy at point o minus the temperature at point o times the difference between the entropy at point 5 and the entropy at point o plus the kinetic energy at point e5 equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at point e and the enthalpy at point s minus the temperature at point o times the difference between the entropy at point 6 and point 5 plus half the difference between the square of the velocity at point e and the square of the velocity at point s.

The difference between the enthalpy at point e and the enthalpy at point s is equal to the integral from the temperature at point o to the temperature at point o of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure times the change in temperature, which equals 1.006 times the sum of 328.07 and 243.15, resulting in 243.15 kilojoules per kilogram.

The difference between the entropy at point 6 and point 5 is equal to the integral from the temperature at point o to the temperature at point o of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure over the temperature times the change in temperature minus the gas constant times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the pressure at point o over the pressure at point o, which equals 1.006 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 328.07 over 243.15 minus 1.725 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 4 over 1, resulting in 0.301 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The change in exergy due to the stream is equal to the total mass flow rate times the difference between 85.43 kilojoules per kilogram and 243.15 kilojoules per kilogram times 0.301 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, which equals the total mass flow rate times 24659.122 kilojoules per kilogram, and the exergy is 24659.122 kilojoules per kilogram.
