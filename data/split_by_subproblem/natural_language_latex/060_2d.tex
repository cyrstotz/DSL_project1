The derivative of epsilon_x with respect to time t equals the sum of epsilon_x,str minus the derivative of epsilon_x,vel with respect to time minus the sum of epsilon_x,qj minus the sum of the product of the derivative of W_n with respect to time t and the fraction of p_0 times the derivative of V with respect to time t.

Epsilon_x,a equals the integral from a of the product of one minus the fraction of T_c over T_a, SQ of the cosine of theta, times the derivative of gamma with respect to gamma.

The derivative of epsilon_x with respect to time t equals the sum of epsilon_x,str plus the sum of epsilon_x,qj minus epsilon_x,vel equals 80.2 kilojoules per kilogram minus epsilon_x,vel.

Epsilon_x,vel plus ke equals 80.2 plus epsilon_x,q minus epsilon_x,vel.

Implying that epsilon_x,vel equals 80.2 plus epsilon_x,q minus epsilon_x,vel minus ke.

Ke equals the fraction of w squared over 2.
