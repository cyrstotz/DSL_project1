b)

The temperature \( T_{SU,2} \) equals the temperature \( T_{EW,1} \), which is \( 0^\circ \) Celsius.

The pressure \( p_{g,1} \) equals the pressure \( p_{g,2} \) and is approximately \( 1.40094 \) bar.

There is thermal equilibrium in state 2.

There is also equilibrium of forces.

3.c) Perfect Gas & Isobaric:

The product of mass \( m \) and the difference in enthalpy \( (h_2 - h_1) \) equals the heat transfer \( Q_{12} \).

The product of mass \( m \), the sum of constant volume specific heat \( C_v \) and gas constant \( R \), and the change in temperature \( \Delta (T_2 - T_1) \) equals the heat transfer \( Q_{12} \).

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is \(-1.367 \) kilojoules.

**System boundary Gas:**

There is a rectangular box divided into two horizontal sections. The upper section is labeled "EW" and the lower section is labeled "Gas". An arrow labeled \( Q_{12} \) points upwards from the lower section (Gas) to the upper section (EW).
