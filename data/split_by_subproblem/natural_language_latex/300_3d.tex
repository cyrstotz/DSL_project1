The quantity \( Q_{12} \) equals 1366.8 Joules.

The equations are as follows:
1. \( E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} \)
2. \( U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12} \)

For \( U_2 \), the equation is:
\[ U_2 = x_2 U_{Fe} + (1 - x_2) U_{Fl} \]
This is taken from Table 1.

Where:
\[ U_{Fe} = -333.458 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \]
\[ U_{Fl} = -0.045 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \]

For \( U_1 \), the equation is:
\[ U_1 = x_1 U_{Fe} + (1 - x_1) U_{Fl} = -200.803 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \]
And \( x_1 = 0.6 \).

The equation to find \( x_2 \) is:
\[ x_2 (U_{Fe} - U_{Fl}) + U_{Fl} - U_1 = Q_{12} \]
Solving for \( x_2 \), we get:
\[ x_2 = \frac{Q_{12} + U_1 - U_{Fl}}{U_{Fe} - U_{Fl}} \]

Finally, \( x_2 \) is calculated to be approximately 0.598.
