Item c) First equation for a gas in a closed system:

Delta U equals Q subscript 12 minus W subscript 12, which equals Q subscript 12 minus W subscript V.

Q subscript 12 equals Q subscript 2 minus Q subscript 1, which equals W subscript V.

Q subscript 12 equals Q subscript 2 minus Q subscript 1 plus W subscript V.
