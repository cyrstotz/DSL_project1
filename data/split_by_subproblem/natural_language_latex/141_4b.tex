The content includes:

- The mass flow rate of R134a.
- The term "stationary process" followed by "(Balance around the compressor)".
- An equation stating zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entry minus the power input to the compressor.
- The mass flow rate is expressed as the power input to the compressor divided by the difference between the enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entry, which equals 28 times omega divided by the difference between the enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entry.
- The power input to the compressor is given as 28 omega.
- It mentions that the values of enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entry should be read from Table A-11.
- The value of enthalpy at exit is not provided and seems to be left for further input or calculation.
