The specific work \( W_G \) is 520 kilojoules per kilogram.

The temperature \( T_6 \) is 340 Kelvin.

The change in exergy due to irreversible processes \( \Delta e_{\text{ex,istr}} \) is calculated as the difference between the exergy at state 6 and state 0, expressed as \( e_{\text{ex,istr6}} - e_{\text{ex,istr0}} \).

The exergy at state 6 \( e_{\text{ex,istr6}} \) is given by the formula \( h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} \).

The exergy at state 0 \( e_{\text{ex,istr0}} \) simplifies to \( \frac{w_0^2}{2} \) since \( h_0 - h_0 - T_0 (s_0 - s_0) \) equals zero.

The change in exergy \( \Delta e_{\text{ex,istr}} \) is then \( h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2} \).

The reference temperature \( T_{u0} \) or \( T_0 \) is 243.15 Kelvin.

The change in enthalpy from state 0 to state 6 is \( h_6 - h_0 = c_p \cdot (T_6 - T_0) \), assuming an ideal gas (IG) with stable properties.

The change in entropy from state 0 to state 6 is \( s_6 - s_0 = c_p \cdot \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) \), also under the assumption of ideal gas behavior.

The change in exergy due to irreversible processes is then calculated as \( \Delta e_{\text{ex,istr}} = c_p \cdot \left[ (T_6 - T_0) - T_0 \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) \right] + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2} \).

Finally, substituting the values, \( \Delta e_{\text{ex,istr}} \) is calculated as \( 1.006 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} \left[ (340 - 243.15) - 243.15 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{340}{243.15} \right) \right] + \frac{520^2 - 200^2}{2} \), resulting in \( \Delta e_{\text{ex,istr}} = 125.42 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).
