The temperature \( T_{e2} \) is equal to 0 degrees Celsius and the pressure \( p_{e2} \) is equal to \( p_{e1} \) which is 1.966 bar.

**Temperature:** Since \( x = 0 \), the system is still in phase equilibrium and all the heat supplied was used for melting, not for increasing the temperature, and the ice is in thermal equilibrium, which implies the same temperature.

**Pressure:** Since the external pressure and the mass are constant, the pressure \( p \) automatically remains constant as well.
