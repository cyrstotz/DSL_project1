c) The rate of change of specific exergy due to storage, denoted as e-dot subscript x1, sto, is equal to the integral from v0 to v of v0 times v divided by 2 with respect to v, at a constant temperature T0, and is related to the term "pro bezogen auf f√ºr Enge" (translated as "per related to for narrowness"). This results in e-dot subscript x1, sto being equal to 20 kilojoules per kilogram.

The rate of change of specific exergy due to storage, e-dot subscript x1, sto, is also given by the formula h1 minus h0 minus T0 times (s1 minus s0) plus v0 squared divided by 2.

This expression simplifies to cp times (T0 minus T0) minus T0 times (cp times the natural logarithm of T0 over T0) minus R times the natural logarithm of p over p0 plus v0 squared divided by 2.

This results in 85.149 kilojoules per kilogram minus 73.27 kilojoules per kilogram plus 124.448 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 136.605 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, the change in the rate of specific exergy due to storage, Delta e-dot subscript x1, sto, is underlined as 116.60 kilojoules per kilogram.
