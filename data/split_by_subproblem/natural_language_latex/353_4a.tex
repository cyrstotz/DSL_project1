The graph is a phase diagram with pressure on the y-axis and temperature on the x-axis. The y-axis is labeled "P [mBAR]" and the x-axis is labeled "T [째C]". The graph displays three regions labeled "solid", "liquid", and "gas". The "solid" region is on the left, the "liquid" region is on the top right, and the "gas" region is on the bottom right. The graph includes a line that starts from the origin and curves upwards, representing the sublimation point. There is a point labeled "TRIPLE" at 5 mBAR and 0째C. Two vertical dashed lines are drawn at -20째C and 0째C. There are two horizontal arrows labeled "I" and "II" indicating transitions between phases. The arrow "I" points downwards from the "liquid" region to the "gas" region, and the arrow "II" points downwards from the "solid" region to the "gas" region. The temperature difference between the two arrows is labeled "10K".
