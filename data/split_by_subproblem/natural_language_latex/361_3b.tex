(Diagram of a container with arrows pointing inward and outward)

The pressure inside the container \( p_{gz} \) equals the external pressure \( p_g \) which is 1.4 bar, indicating that the same forces are still acting from outside.

The temperature inside the container \( T_{gz} \) equals the environmental temperature \( T_{ew} \) which is 0 degrees Celsius, implying that the water is still in the ice-water state and is in the solid-liquid region.

There is no heat transfer: \( T_{gz} \) equals \( T_{ew} \).
