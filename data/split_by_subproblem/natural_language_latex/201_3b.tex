b) Continue with \( p_{g1} = 7.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( m_g = 3 \, \text{kg} \).

Goal: \( x_{g1,2} \), \( T_{g1,2} \), \( p_{g1,2} \) with the condition \( x_{g1,2} > 0 \).

Assuming that the ice has completely melted, it remains:

\( T_{g1,2} < T_{g1,1} \) then temperature equalization until \( T_{ev,1} \approx T_{g1,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).

Because \( V_{g1,2} \) decreases, \( p_{g1,2} \) increases due to forces/pressures.

\( p_{g1,2} = p_{g1,1} \) then no additional effects at state 2.
