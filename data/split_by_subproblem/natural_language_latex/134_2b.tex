- Isentropic: u equals k equals 1.4 implies the ratio of T_c over T_s equals the ratio of p_c over p_s raised to the power of (k-1) over k. Therefore, T_c equals T_s times (6.1 over 0.5) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1) over 1.4, which equals 328.675 Kelvin.

- Energy balance: m dot times (h_1 minus h_2) plus the fraction of (w_s squared minus w_c squared) over 2 plus Q dot plus W dot equals zero.

- This implies m dot times c_p times u times (T_s minus T_c) plus the fraction of (w_s squared minus w_c squared) over 2 plus R times (T_2 minus T_1) equals zero.

- R equals c_p minus c_v and the ratio of c_p over c_v equals 1.4 implies c_v equals c_p divided by 1.4, which equals 0.718 times c_p.

- R equals 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

- Implies T_R: in ?
