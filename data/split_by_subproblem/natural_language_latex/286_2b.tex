The speed \( w_S \) equals 220 meters per second.
The ratio of \( T_6 \) to \( T_5 \) is 0.5 bar.
The pressure \( p_6 \) equals 0.737 bar.
The mass flow rate \( m_S \) equals \( m_6 \).
The ratio of \( w_6 \) to \( p_6 \) equals the ratio of \( w_S \) to \( p_S \).
This implies \( w_6 \) equals \( w_S \) times the ratio of \( p_6 \) to \( p_S \), which calculates to 575.9 meters per second.
The ratio of \( T_6 \) to \( T_5 \) equals the ratio of \( p_6 \) to \( p_5 \) raised to the power of \( \frac{n-1}{n} \).
This implies \( T_6 \) equals 431.8 Kelvin times the ratio of 0.737 bar to 0.5 bar raised to the power of \( \frac{0.4}{1.4} \), which calculates to 328.1 Kelvin.
