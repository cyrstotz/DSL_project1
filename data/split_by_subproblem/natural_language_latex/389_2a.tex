The graph is described as a pressure-entropy (p-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with entropy in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled with temperature in Kelvin. Several isobars are drawn on the graph, with pressures of 0.191 bar and 0.5 bar indicated. The graph depicts a cycle with six points labeled from 1 to 6. The cycle begins at point 1, progresses to point 2, then to point 3, 4, 5, and returns back to point 1. The temperature at the bottom of the graph is marked as minus 30 degrees Celsius.
