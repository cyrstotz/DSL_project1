The change in internal energy, Delta U, is equal to Q from state 1 to state 2 minus the work done from state 1 to state 2 at constant volume.

The differential of internal energy minus m times g times the difference between u2 and u1 equals Q from state 1 to state 2.

It implies that m times g times u times the difference between TG2 and TG1 equals Q from state 1 to state 2, which equals negative 1.083 kilojoules.
