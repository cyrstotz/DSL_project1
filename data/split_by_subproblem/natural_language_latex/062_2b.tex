The ratio of T6 to T5 is equal to the ratio of p6 to p5 raised to the power of (n-1) divided by n.

T6 equals T5 times the ratio of 0.191 to 0.5 raised to the power of 0.1 divided by 1.4, which equals 328.07 Kelvin.

The mass flow rate times the quantity (h5 minus h6 plus the difference of the squares of w5 and w6 divided by 2) equals zero (stationary).

The quantity (h5 minus h6) minus the quantity (w5 squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2) equals zero.

The square of w6 equals two times (h5 minus h6) plus the square of w5.

w0 equals the square root of two times (hf minus h0) plus uc, ist, which equals the square root of 2 times 107.5 times 10 to the power of 3 Joules per kilogram times (200 meters squared per second squared), resulting in 498.80 meters per second.
