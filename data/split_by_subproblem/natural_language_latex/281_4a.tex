The graph is a pressure-temperature diagram, denoted as p-T diagram. The y-axis is labeled p for pressure and the x-axis is labeled T in degrees Celsius for temperature. There is a closed loop on the graph with four points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. The loop starts at point 1, proceeds to point 2, then to point 3, then to point 4, and returns back to point 1. The shape of the loop is roughly elliptical, with point 1 located at the top right, point 2 at the bottom right, point 3 at the bottom left, and point 4 at the top left.
