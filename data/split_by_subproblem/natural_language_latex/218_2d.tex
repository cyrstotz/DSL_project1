Zero equals the mass flow rate times negative delta E sub x plus the quantity one minus the ratio of T sub zero over T times Q sub j minus Ex vel. Ex vel equals one hundred kJ per kg minus four point five kJ per kg. Ex vel equals one hundred kJ per kg plus the quantity one minus the ratio of two hundred forty-three point one five Kelvin over one thousand two hundred eighty-nine Kelvin times one point one nine five kJ per kg. This equals one thousand sixty-nine point five five kJ per kg underlined.
