The average temperature, denoted as T-bar, is calculated as follows:

1. T-bar equals the integral of T dS from S_a to S_e, divided by the difference S_a minus S_e.
2. This expression simplifies to (h_a minus h_e) divided by (S_a minus S_e).
3. Further, it can be expressed as (Q-dot times (T_a minus T_e) plus m-dot times (h-bar minus h_e)) divided by (m-dot times the natural logarithm of (T_a divided by T_e)).
4. Substituting values, it becomes (298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin) divided by the natural logarithm of (298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin).
5. The result is 293.12 Kelvin.
