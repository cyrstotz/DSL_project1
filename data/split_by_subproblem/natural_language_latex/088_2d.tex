Energy for stationary fixed point:

Zero equals negative kinetic energy rate plus the sum of one minus the ratio of T0 over T times the heat rate minus the sum of the work rate minus the internal energy due to losses.

Internal energy due to losses equals negative kinetic energy rate plus one minus the ratio of T0 over T times the heat rate.

Internal energy due to losses equals 847.38 kilojoules per kilogram.

q equals negative 1485 kilojoules per kilogram.

T0 equals 293.15 Kelvin.

Average T0 equals 1289 Kelvin.
