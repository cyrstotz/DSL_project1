The average temperature T-bar is equal to the sum of the outlet temperature T-aus and the inlet temperature T-ein, divided by 2, which equals the sum of 293.15 and 293.15 divided by 2, resulting in 293.15 Kelvin.

The temperature T is equal to the product of q_T and r, divided by the difference of q_e minus q_e.
