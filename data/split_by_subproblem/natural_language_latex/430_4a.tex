- The graph is a pressure-volume diagram with the x-axis labeled "V [L]" and the y-axis labeled "p [bar]".
- The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Point 1 is at the bottom left, labeled "Liquid".
- Point 2 is at the bottom right, labeled "Wet steam".
- Point 3 is at the top right, labeled "Dry".
- Point 4 is at the top left, labeled "Superheated steam".
- The curve from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isothermal".
- The curve from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isothermal".
- The curve from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "isothermal".
- The curve from point 4 to point 1 is labeled "isothermal".
