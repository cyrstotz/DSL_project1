The section is titled "2. HS stationary adiabatic".

The equations are as follows:

1. Q equals s_0 minus s_6 plus the rate of entropy generation, which implies that the rate of entropy generation equals s_6 minus s_0.

2. The entropy generation rate is equal to c_p1 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_6 to T_0 minus R times h times the ratio of p_6 raised to the power of 0.5 to p_0. This is further calculated with specific values as 1.006 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 328.0 to 293.15, which equals 0.3 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

3. This implies that the rate of heat transfer per unit mass, denoted as dot q erw, equals T_0 times the rate of entropy generation, which equals 73.27 kilowatts per kilogram.
