The mass of the gas, denoted as \( m_g \), is calculated using the Ideal Gas Equation. The equation for the mass of the gas is given by:

\[ m_g = \frac{pV_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} \]

where \( R \) is the gas constant, calculated as:

\[ R = \frac{8.314 \, \text{Joules per mole Kelvin}}{50 \, \text{kilograms per mole}} = 166.28 \, \text{Joules per kilogram Kelvin} \]

Using the values for pressure \( p \), volume \( V_{g,1} \), and temperature \( T_{g,1} \), the mass of the gas is calculated as:

\[ m_g = \frac{14.1079 \, \text{Pascals} \times 3.14 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{cubic meters}}{166.28 \, \text{Joules per kilogram Kelvin} \times 273.15 \, \text{Kelvin}} = 0.00342 \, \text{kilograms} = 3.42 \, \text{grams} \]
