Verbal Description of the Graph:

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as 's' in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin [kJ/kgÂ·K] and the y-axis is labeled as 'T' in Kelvin [K]. There are six points labeled from 1 to 6. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are connected by a path that forms a loop. Points 5 and 6 are connected vertically to points 2 and 1, respectively. There are three isobaric lines (constant pressure lines) drawn in blue, labeled as 'p5 equals 0.5 bar' and 'p6 equals 0.191 bar'. The isobaric lines are marked with an asterisk (*).
