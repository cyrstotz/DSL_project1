Energy balance of a liquid engine (system boundary around the entire engine):

The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times the sum of the enthalpy at point 0 minus the enthalpy at point 6 plus half the square of the outlet velocity minus half the square of the velocity at point 6, plus the sum of heat transfer rates minus the sum of work rates.

Negative square of the velocity at point 6 equals two times the enthalpy at point 0 minus two times the enthalpy at point 6 plus the square of the outlet velocity.

Negative mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between point 0 and point 6 equals the integral from temperature at point 0 to temperature at point 6 of the specific heat at constant pressure times the differential of temperature.

To determine:

Temperature at point 6 equals temperature at point 5 times the ratio of pressure at point 0 to pressure at point 5 raised to the power of (gamma minus one divided by gamma), which is illegible.

Temperature at point 6 equals 431.5 Kelvin times 0.191 raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4), which equals 328.08747 Kelvin.

The difference in enthalpy between point 0 and point 6 equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference between 743.15 Kelvin and 328.08747 Kelvin, which equals negative 85.434 kilojoules per kilogram.

Velocity at point 6 equals the square root of two times negative 85.434 plus 200 meters squared per second squared.
