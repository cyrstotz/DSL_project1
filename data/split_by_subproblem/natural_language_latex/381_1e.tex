a) Entropy

The equation is zero equals mass flow rate times the difference between entropy at point c and entropy at point a, plus the ratio of the heat flow rate out times the useful entropy over the temperature inside, pointing towards 100 degrees Celsius.

The useful entropy equals the mass flow rate times the difference between entropy at point a and entropy at point e, pointing towards 65 kilowatts.

The ratio of 65 kilowatts over 373.15 equals 0.127 kilojoules.

TA2

The entropy at point e equals the entropy at the fluid state at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 0.8549.

The entropy at point a equals the entropy at the fluid state at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 1.3069.
