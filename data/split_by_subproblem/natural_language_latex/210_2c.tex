The change in exergy due to the stream, denoted as Delta e_x,str, is equal to e_x,str6 minus e_x,h0. The value of e_x,str6 is given by h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times the difference between s_6 and s_0. Therefore, the difference between e_x,str6 and e_x,h0 is equal to h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times the difference between s_6 and s_0, which equals Delta dot e_x,str.

The ratio of h_6 to h_0 is equal to the difference between h_6 and h_0 divided by c_p times the difference between T_6 and T_0.

The difference between s_6 and s_0 is equal to c_p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_6 to T_0 minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p_6 to p_0, where p_6 equals p_0.

This implies that Delta dot e_x,str is equal to c_p times the quantity T_6 minus T_0 minus T_0 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_6 to T_0.

Substituting values, this expression becomes 1.006 times the quantity 340 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 340 Kelvin to 243.15 Kelvin, with units kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

This results in a final value of 115.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
