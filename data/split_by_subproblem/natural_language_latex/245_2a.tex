The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled T in Kelvin and the horizontal axis labeled S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph contains a curve with several points marked and labeled as follows:
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.
- Point 2 is slightly above and to the right of Point 1.
- Point 3 is above Point 2, connected by a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 4/5 is to the right of Point 2, connected by a line labeled "adiabat, irreversible".
- Point 6 is to the right of Point 4/5, connected by a line labeled "adiabat, reversible".
- Point 0 is to the right of Point 6.
