The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled s (entropy) and the y-axis is labeled T (temperature). The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The region between points 1 and 2 is labeled "vapor-liquid two-phase region". The region to the left of point 4 is labeled "liquid", and the region to the right of point 3 is labeled "gas". There is an isobar labeled "Isobar p3 equals 8 bar" extending vertically from point 3. The process from point 4 to point 1 is labeled "adiabatic".
