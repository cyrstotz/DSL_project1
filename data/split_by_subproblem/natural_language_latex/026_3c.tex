The equations are as follows:

1. The derivative of E with respect to t equals Q dot minus the sum of W dot superscript c.

2. m times g times the difference between u2 and u1 equals Q dot.

3. m times g times v times the difference between T2 and T1 equals negative 1.07 kilowatts, which is equal to Q dot.
