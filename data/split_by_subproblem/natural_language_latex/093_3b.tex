p2 equals p1 (No change in pressure, because the pressure depends on the weight and volume).

Interpolation of the temperatures of water:

T at 1.0 bar equals T at 1.4 bar minus (9.8 times 6.1 bar) divided by (2 minus 1.0 bar).

This equals negative 0.012 degrees Celsius (The temperature must be the same, because of the Cp of the TD, since ice is present = solid).
