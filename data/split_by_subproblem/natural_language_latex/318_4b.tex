Mass flow rate total.
The temperature inside the evaporator is 9 degrees Celsius, denoted as T_i.
The temperature inside the evaporator is 9 degrees Celsius minus 6 Kelvin, which equals 3 degrees Celsius.
The equation zero equals mass flow rate times the difference between h_2 and h_3 plus the power of the compressor.
The power of the compressor equals the mass flow rate times the ratio of the power of the compressor to the difference between h_2 and h_3.
h_3 is obtained from Table A-12 through interpolation.
The equation for interpolation is y equals (x minus x_1) divided by (x_2 minus x_1) times (y_2 minus y_1) plus y_1.
h_2 at temperature T_2, which is at -22 degrees Celsius, is completely evaporated.
h_2 at -22 degrees Celsius equals 234.08 kilojoules per kilogram.
Interpolation between 0 degrees Celsius and 6 degrees Celsius.
The equation for interpolation is y equals (x minus x_1) divided by (x_2 minus x_1) times (y_2 minus y_1) plus y_1.
y equals 2.94 kilojoules per kilogram.
y_2 equals 247.23 kilojoules per kilogram.
x_1 equals 0 degrees Celsius.
x_2 equals 6 degrees Celsius.
h_3 equals (value not provided in the text).
