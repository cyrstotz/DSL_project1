c) Entropy balance at the drive

The mass flow rate times the difference in entropy at the inlet and outlet plus the difference in heat flow rate at the source and outlet divided by the temperature equals the generated entropy, which is greater than or equal to zero.

The generated entropy equals the mass flow rate times the difference in entropy at the outlet and inlet minus the difference in heat flow rate at the source and outlet divided by the temperature, which implies here only with 67.182.

The generated entropy equals the mass flow rate times the difference in entropy at the outlet and inlet minus the difference in heat flow rate at the source and outlet divided by the temperature equals negative 0.0226 kilojoules per Kelvin.

The mass times the change in work equals 0.98 kilograms.

W equals 1.3069.
