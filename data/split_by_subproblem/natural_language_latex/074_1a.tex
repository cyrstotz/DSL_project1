The equation is:
h_c minus h_q equals the integral from T_1 to T_2 of c times dt.

State:
The rate of heat Q_R equals the rate of heat out, which is 100 kilowatts.

Energy Balance:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the quantity (h_c minus h_q) plus the rate of heat out.

Energy Balance:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times (h_e minus h_i) plus the rate of heat minus the rate of work.

Semi-open System:
m_2 times u_2 minus m_1 times u_1 equals (mass flow rate times delta t) times h_ein plus the rate of heat minus the rate of work.
