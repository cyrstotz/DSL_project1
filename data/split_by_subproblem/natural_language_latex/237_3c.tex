The change in internal energy, denoted as delta u subscript g, equals the heat transfer rate, dot Q subscript 12, divided by the mass m.

The heat transfer Q subscript 12 equals the mass m times the specific heat at constant volume c subscript V times the difference in temperature between T subscript 2g and T subscript g1, which equals 110.45 Joules.

The temperature T subscript 2g is 0.003 degrees Celsius, which is equal to 273.153 Kelvin.

The temperature T subscript g1 is 773.15 Kelvin.
