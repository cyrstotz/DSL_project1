The equation for \( T_{KF} \) is given as the integral of \( T \) with respect to \( dS \) from \( S_a \) to \( S_e \), divided by \( S_a - S_e \), which equals \( \frac{q_{ea}}{S_a - S_e} \). This expression simplifies further to \( \frac{h_a - h_e}{S_e - S_e} \), and then to \( \frac{sp (T_a - T_e)}{sp \cdot \ln \left( \frac{T_a}{T_e} \right)} \). Continuing, it simplifies to \( \frac{T_a - T_e}{\ln \left( \frac{T_a}{T_e} \right)} \), and then to \( \frac{T_{KF, \text{out}} - T_{KF, \text{in}}}{\ln \left( \frac{T_{KF, \text{out}}}{T_{KF, \text{in}}} \right)} \), resulting in a final value of 253.12157 Kelvin, which equals \( T_{KF} \).

Graphical Description:
There is a small diagram on the right side of the page. The diagram consists of a rectangular box labeled "Q_{\text{out}}" in the center. There are arrows pointing into and out of the box. The arrow pointing into the box from the left is labeled "m_{\text{in}}", and the arrow pointing out of the box to the right is labeled "m_{\text{out}}". The box is enclosed in a dashed rectangle.
