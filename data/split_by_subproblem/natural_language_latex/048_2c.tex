The change in internal energy, denoted as delta e subscript x, actual, is given by the sum of several terms: each term is the difference in enthalpy h at two consecutive states minus the product of the temperature T subscript zero and the difference in entropy s at those states. This is expressed from state zero to state six. Simplifying this, it equals the difference in enthalpy between state zero and state six minus the product of the temperature T subscript zero and the difference in entropy between state zero and state six.
