Graph with T on the vertical axis and s on the horizontal axis. There are two isentropic curves and one isobaric curve. The isentropic curves are labeled as follows: The first isentropic curve starts at point 0, passes through point 1, and ends at point 2. The second isentropic curve starts at point 4, passes through point 5, and ends at point 6. The isobaric curve starts at point 2, passes through point 3, and ends at point 4. Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the graph.

The initial pressure \( p_0 \) is 0.1 bar, the initial temperature \( T_0 \) is 30 degrees Celsius, and the initial entropy \( s_0 \) is not specified.

There is a horizontal arrow pointing to the right labeled \( s_0 \). Another horizontal arrow pointing to the right is labeled \( s_1 \) which is not equal to \( s_0 \).
