Graph Description:

The graph is a phase diagram with the y-axis labeled as p (pressure) and the x-axis labeled as T (temperature). The graph shows a curve starting from the origin and rising upwards, representing the phase boundary between different states of matter.

- The curve is labeled "triple point" at a specific point where three phases meet.
- To the left of the curve, the region is labeled "solid".
- To the right of the curve, the region is labeled "liquid".
- Above the curve, the region is labeled "vapor".
- There is a line extending from the triple point upwards at an angle labeled 2 alpha.
- Another line extends horizontally from the triple point to the right, indicating the boundary between liquid and vapor phases.
- A point on the curve is labeled "boiling point".
