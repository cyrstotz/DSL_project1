The average temperature T-bar is equal to the difference between the enthalpy at point a and point e, divided by the difference between the entropy at point a and point e, which implies an ideal fluid.

The average temperature T-bar is equal to the integral from T1 to T2 of C dT, divided by the integral from T1 to T2 of C over T dT, where there is no change in pressure and C is constant.

In another expression, given that c is constant, the average temperature T-bar is equal to the heat flow rate times the difference between T2 and T1, divided by the heat flow rate times the natural logarithm of T2 over T1.

T2 is given as 298.15 and T1 is given as 288.15, resulting in an average temperature T-bar of 293.12 Kelvin.
