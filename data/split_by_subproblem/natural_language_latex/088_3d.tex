x sub 1 equals 0.6. The rate of change of energy with respect to time equals the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy at point 1, half of the velocity at point 1 squared, plus g times z, minus the rate of heat transfer, minus the rate of work done, and the rate of change of volume is constant.

We calculate with Q equals 1500 Joules.

Change in internal energy equals Q sub 21.
The mass of water times the difference in internal energy between state 2 and state 1 equals Q sub 21.
Internal energy at state 2 equals Q sub 21 divided by the mass of water plus internal energy at state 1, which equals negative 185.1 Joules per kilogram.

x sub s equals the ratio of internal energy at state 2 minus the minimum internal energy to the difference between the critical internal energy and the minimum internal energy, which equals 0.555.
