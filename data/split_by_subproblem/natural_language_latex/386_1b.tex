The average temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is equal to the integral from \( s_e \) to \( s_a \) of \( T \) dS divided by \( s_a - s_e \).
The integral of \( T \) dS equals \( \Delta U \), as per the table (Differential, dm isobaric).
The difference \( s_a - s_e \) is equal to \( c_{if} \) times the natural logarithm of \( \frac{T_e}{T_a} \).
The average temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is then given by \( \frac{T_e - T_a}{\ln \left( \frac{T_e}{T_a} \right)} \), which equals 293.122 Kelvin.
