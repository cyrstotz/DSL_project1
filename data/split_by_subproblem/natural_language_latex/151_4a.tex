The graph described is a Pressure-Temperature (p-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled T in degrees Celsius and ranges from negative 50 to 10 degrees. The y-axis is labeled p in bars and ranges from 0.01 to 10 bars. The graph displays a phase diagram with a curve that separates the liquid and gas phases. This curve begins at the bottom left and curves upwards to the right. The area below the curve is labeled as "gas" and the area above the curve is labeled as "liquid" (fl√ºssig in German). Several points and lines are marked on the graph:
- Point 1 is located on the curve and is labeled "1".
- Point 2 is situated above the curve and is labeled "2".
- Point 3 is found below the curve and is labeled "3".
- A vertical line, labeled "isobar", connects points 2 and 3.
- A horizontal line, labeled "isotherm", connects points 1 and 2.
- Another vertical line, labeled "GK", extends upwards from point 2.
