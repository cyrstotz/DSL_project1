The section discusses the entropy balance for the entire system in a stationary state. The equation provided is:

Zero equals the mass flow rate of water times the sum of the entropy of water at the entry and the entropy of water at the exit, plus the mass flow rate of the coolant times the sum of the entropy of the coolant at the entry and the entropy of the coolant at the exit, plus the heat flow rate out of the system divided by the average temperature of the coolant, plus the rate of entropy generation.

Additionally, there is a reference to Table A2.

The entropy at the entry for a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius and a quality of 0.005 is 0.789 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy at the exit for a temperature of 1000 degrees Celsius and a quality of 0.005 is 1.837 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The equation is cut off and incomplete as it ends with "[s_e^{KF} - s".
