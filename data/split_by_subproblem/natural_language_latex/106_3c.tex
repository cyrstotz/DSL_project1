The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to the change in internal energy, Delta U, plus the canceled terms kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE), which equals Q12 minus the canceled work W12.

Q12 is equal to the specific heat at constant volume, cv, times the difference in temperature from T1 to T2, plus the canceled term R times T2 divided by V2.

This results in negative 316.5 kilojoules.
