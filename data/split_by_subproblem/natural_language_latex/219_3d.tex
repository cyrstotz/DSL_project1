1. Heat Equation:

The mass of the evaporating working fluid times the change in internal energy (u2 minus u1) equals the heat transfer Q12:

\[ m_{EW} (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12} \]

The internal energy u1 is given by the formula:

\[ u_1 = u_f + x_1 (u_s - u_f) = -200.03 \, \frac{\text{kj}}{\text{kg}} \quad \text{(from Table 1)} \]

The internal energy u2 is the sum of the heat transfer Q12 and the internal energy u1, and can also be expressed as:

\[ u_2 = Q_{12} + u_1 = u_f + x_2 (u_s - u_f) \]

The value of u2 is:

\[ u_2 = -183.54 \, \frac{\text{kj}}{\text{kg}} \]

From this, the quality x2 can be calculated as:

\[ \Rightarrow x_2 = \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_s - u_f} = 0.5638 \quad \text{(from Table 2)} \]
