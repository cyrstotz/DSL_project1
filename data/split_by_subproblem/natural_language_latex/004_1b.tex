The average temperature, denoted as T-bar subscript HF, is equal to the integral from s-subscript-ein to s-subscript-aus of T ds, divided by the difference s-subscript-aus minus s-subscript-ein, which equals the difference U-subscript-aus minus U-subscript-ein divided by c raised to the power f times the natural logarithm of the ratio T-subscript-aus over T-subscript-ein.

Material model:
Delta s equals the integral of c raised to the power f times the natural logarithm of the ratio T-subscript-aus over T-subscript-ein.
Delta U equals c raised to the power f times the difference T-subscript-aus minus T-subscript-ein.
The average temperature, denoted as T-bar, equals the difference T-subscript-aus minus T-subscript-ein divided by the natural logarithm of the ratio T-subscript-aus over T-subscript-ein, which equals 293.72 Kelvin.
