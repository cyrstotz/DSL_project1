The average temperature T-bar subscript KF equals the integral from s1 to s2 of T ds divided by s1 minus s2.

This equals h1 minus h2 divided by s1 minus s2, which equals the integral from T1 to T2 of T dT divided by the integral from T1 to T2 of dT over T, which equals negative 10 k divided by the natural logarithm of T1 over T2, which equals negative 10 k divided by the natural logarithm of 293.15 Kelvin over 283.15 Kelvin, which equals 293.15 Kelvin.

The pressure p is constant.

Ideal fluid.
