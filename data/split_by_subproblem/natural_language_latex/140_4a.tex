Verbal Description of the Graph:

The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as P in bars and the x-axis labeled as T in Kelvin. The graph displays a curve that begins at the bottom left, ascends to a peak, and then descends. The curve is segmented into three regions: "sol." (solid) on the left, "flu." (fluid) in the middle, and "gas" on the right. There are three points marked on the curve: point 1 at the bottom right, point 2 at the bottom left, and point 3 at the peak. A vertical dashed line extends upwards from point 3. A horizontal arrow points from point 2 to point 1.

The equations provided are:
- Epsilon k equals the absolute value of Q dot zu divided by the absolute value of omega dot plus.
- Epsilon k equals the absolute value of Q dot t divided by the absolute value of omega dot t.
