The pressure \( p_{g1} \) equals 1 milligram.
The temperature \( T_{g1} \) equals 500 degrees Celsius, which is equivalent to 773 Kelvin.
The volume \( V_{g1} \) equals 3.14 liters, which is equivalent to 0.00314 cubic meters.
The equation \( pV = nRT \) represents the ideal gas law.
The gas constant \( R \) is given by \( R \) divided by the molar mass \( M_g \), which equals 0.166.
The molar mass \( M_g \) of the gas is 50 kilograms per kilomole.
The equation \( pV = n \overline{R} T \) represents another form of the ideal gas law using the specific gas constant \( \overline{R} \).
