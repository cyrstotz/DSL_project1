The graph description is as follows: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled p in megapascals and the horizontal axis labeled T in kelvins. The plot consists of a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The loop starts at point 1, moves to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 4, before returning to point 1. The path from point 1 to point 2 is a rising curve, from point 2 to point 3 is a horizontal line, from point 3 to point 4 is a falling curve, and from point 4 back to point 1 is a horizontal line.
