The graph is a Temperature (T) versus Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as 'S' and the y-axis is labeled as 'T'. There is a curve that starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls back down. The curve is labeled as "isobaric heat addition". There are several annotations around the graph:
- To the right of the peak, there is a label "adiabatically reversible".
- Below the peak, there is a label "adiabatically irreversible".
- To the left of the peak, there is a label "adiabatically reversible".
- There is a point labeled "1" on the left side of the curve and a point labeled "2" on the right side of the curve.
- There is a label "adiabatic compression with Pi less than 1" near the bottom right of the graph.
- There is a label "adiabatically reversible nozzle" near the top right of the graph.
- There is a label "adiabatically irreversible turbine" near the bottom right of the graph.
