Required: \( p_{01} \) and \( m_g \)

Weight resting on the gas: \( m_{ew} + m_c + p_{\text{membrane}} = 0.1 \text{kg} + 3 \text{kg} = 3.2 \text{kg} \)

\( m_g = 32.1 \text{kg} \times 9.81 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2} = 314.901 \text{N} \)

\( p_0 = p_1 + \frac{F_g}{A} = p_{\text{amb}} + \frac{F_g}{A} \)

\( p_0 \) is represented by a graph with a sinusoidal wave pattern, where the amplitude of the wave is approximately 0.05 meters, and the wave is centered around 314.901 Newtons. The x-axis is labeled in meters and the y-axis in Newtons.

\( p_{01} = 1.401 \text{ bar} \)
