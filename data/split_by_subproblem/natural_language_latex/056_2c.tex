The change in exergy, denoted as delta e_x, is calculated as the difference between e_x at state 6 and e_x at state 1. This is expressed as:

Delta e_x equals e_x at state 6 minus e_x at state 1.

Further, delta e_x is expanded to:

Delta e_x equals h at state 6 minus h at state 0 minus T_0 times (s at state 6 minus s at state 0) plus half of w at state 6 squared minus the quantity h at state 0 minus T_0 times (s at state 0 minus s at state 0) plus half of w at state 0 squared.

The difference h_6 minus h_0 is given by c_p times (T_6 minus T_0) and equals 85.429.

The difference s_6 minus s_0 is calculated as the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_6 to T_0 minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p_6 to p_0, and this equals 0.2395.

Finally, delta e_x is given as 130 kilojoules per kilogram.
