The pressure remains the same, since the external pressure and mass are equal: \( p_2 = 1.400394 \, \text{bar} \)

The mass of the gas, pressure, and gas constant remain the same, but the volume, and thus also the temperature, decreases since \( x_{ice} \geq 0 \)

If the temperature of the equilibrium water equals zero and thus the gas temperature \( T_{g,2} = 0 \)
