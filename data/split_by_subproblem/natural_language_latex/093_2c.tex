The content includes an energy balance equation and several related expressions:

1. The equation zero equals the mass flow rate times the expression in brackets, which includes the enthalpy at exit minus the enthalpy at reference conditions minus the reference temperature times the difference in entropy between exit and reference conditions, plus the heat transfer rate times the expression in brackets, which is one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the temperature, minus the external work rate.

2. The term "exst (FS)" appears, which might be a label or placeholder.

3. The equation equals enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at reference conditions minus the reference temperature times the difference in entropy between exit and reference conditions plus kinetic energy plus potential energy.

4. The equation equals exergy flow rate minus the reference exergy equals the expression in brackets, which includes enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at reference conditions minus the reference temperature times the difference in entropy between exit and reference conditions, plus kinetic energy times the difference in the squares of the velocities at exit and reference conditions divided by two.

5. The equation equals the expression in brackets, which includes enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at reference conditions minus the reference temperature times the difference in entropy between exit and reference conditions plus half the difference in the squares of the velocities at exit and reference conditions.
