The task is to find \( Q_{1,2} \).

Starting with the equation:
\[ Q \Rightarrow \Delta E = \Delta U = Q_{1,2} - W_{v,1,2} \]

It implies:
\[ \Delta U_s = m_g C_v (T_2 - T_1) + W_{v,1,2} = Q_{1,2} \]

Where the work done \( W_{v,1,2} \) is given by:
\[ W_{v,1,2} = \] (The equation is incomplete here)
