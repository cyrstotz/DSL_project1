Find the values for omega_c and T_6.

The ratio of T_6 over T_5 equals the ratio of p_6 over p_5 raised to the power of (gamma minus one) divided by gamma.

T_6 equals T_5 times the ratio of p_6 over p_5 raised to the power of (gamma minus one) divided by gamma, which equals 328.07 Kelvin.

The equation is zero equals the total mass flow rate times the quantity of h_5 minus h_6 plus the difference of w_5 squared minus w_6 squared over two, plus xi times the heat flow rate minus the work flow rate at state 6.

This equals c_p times the total difference of T_5 minus T_6.

Omega_c squared equals two times c_p times the difference of T_5 minus T_6 plus omega_5 squared, which equals 507.25 meters squared per second squared.
