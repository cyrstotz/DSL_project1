Section d):

The equation for the efficiency of K, epsilon K, is given by the absolute value of Q dot zu divided by the absolute value of W dot t, which equals the absolute value of Q dot zu divided by the difference of the absolute values of Q dot ab and Q dot zu. This implies that the ratio of W dot K to the difference of Q dot ab and Q dot K equals 28 Watts divided by an unspecified value.

Energy balance:

The equation zero equals m dot times the difference of h1 and h2 plus Q dot K is given. This implies that Q dot K equals m dot times the difference of h2 and h1.

The values of h2 and h1 are not specified.

The initial temperature, T i, is given as minus 10 degrees Celsius, which equals 263.15 Kelvin.
