The change in entropy, Delta S, equals S2 minus S1, which equals m times the difference between s2 and s1, which equals the sum over i of Qi divided by Tj plus S times the term 'e x z' which is cancelled out.

Minus S times 'e x z' times the sum over i of the mass flow rate dot mi times si plus the sum over j of Qj divided by Tj.
