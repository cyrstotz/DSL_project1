c) The rate of entropy production, denoted as S dot subscript "ver"? Zero equals the mass flow rate m dot times the difference in entropy between inlet and outlet (s subscript "ein" minus s subscript "aus") plus the rate of heat transfer Q dot subscript "aus" divided by temperature T plus the rate of entropy production S dot subscript "ver".

The rate of entropy production S dot subscript "ver" equals negative mass flow rate m dot times the difference in entropy between point e and point a (s subscript "e" minus s subscript "a") minus the rate of heat transfer Q dot subscript "aus" divided by the temperature at the cooling fluid T subscript "KF".

The difference in entropy between point e and point a, s subscript "e" minus s subscript "a", equals the specific heat at constant pressure c subscript "p" times the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature at point e to temperature at point a, equals c subscript "p" times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 293.15 Kelvin to 293.15 Kelvin, which results in negative 0.0394 times c subscript "p".

The rate of entropy production S dot subscript "ver" equals negative the mass flow rate at the inlet m dot subscript "ein" times negative 0.0394 times c subscript "p", which equals 0.010233 times c subscript "p" minus 212.116.
