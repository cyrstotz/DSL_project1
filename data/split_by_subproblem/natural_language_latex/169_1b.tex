The average temperature T_kf is given by the integral of T with respect to s from s_a to s_e, divided by the difference between s_a and s_e. This is mathematically represented as:

The average temperature T_kf equals the integral from s_a to s_e of T ds, divided by s_a minus s_e.

This equals the sum of 288.15 and 298.15 Kelvin, divided by 2, which approximately equals 293.15 Kelvin, underlined.
