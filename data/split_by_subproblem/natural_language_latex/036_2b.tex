w_s

The equation zero equals the total mass flow rate times the quantity of h_5 minus h_0 plus half the difference of w_5 squared minus w_0 squared, which equals negative total work rate.

w_5 equals 220 meters per second.

h_5 minus h_4 equals the integral from T_0 to T_5 of c_p of t dt, which equals delta t times c_p, equals the quantity of four times 319.9 Kelvin minus seven times 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The square root of negative the quantity of the total work rate divided by the total mass flow rate plus h_0 minus h_5 times two plus w_5 squared equals w_6.

The total work rate equals the integral from 1 to 2 of P dV, which equals one over one minus nu times the quantity of P_2 V_2 minus P_1 V_1, equals the gas constant times the quantity of T_5 minus T_0 divided by the quantity of seven minus 7.4.

P_0 equals R times T.

R equals c_p minus c_v, and R equals 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

K equals c_p over c_v equals 7.4, and c_p equals c_p over 7.4 equals 2.006 over 7.4 equals 0.719 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
