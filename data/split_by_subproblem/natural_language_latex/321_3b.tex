b) \( P_{s,2} = P_{s,1} \) since the weight of the piston and the weight of the ice-water mixture, as well as the ambient pressure do not change.

\[
T_{agg} = \frac{0.2 \, \text{kg} \cdot 773.15 + 3.4247 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K}}{0.2 \, \text{kg} + 3.4247 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg}}
\]

\[
= 289.694 \, \text{K}
\]

\[
= 16.54^\circ \text{C}
\]
