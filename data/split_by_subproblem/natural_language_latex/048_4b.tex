b)

- A complex diagram is drawn with multiple lines and labels.
- The diagram is labeled as "EB in the Compressor".
- The equation is written as: the mass flow rate of R134a times the difference between h2 and h3 minus the compressor work equals the mass flow rate of R134a times the compressor work divided by the difference between h2 and h3.
- The labels h2, h3, and h3 (8 kJ) are present.
- The label "T" is also present.

- The pressures p3 and p4 are equal to 8 bar.
- The enthalpies h2 and h4 are equal.
- h2 is not specified.

EB in the Compressor

- The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate of R134a times the difference between h2 and h3 minus the compressor work, which implies that the mass flow rate of R134a equals the compressor work divided by the difference between h2 and h3.

- The heat transfer rate at the condenser equals the heat transfer rate at the absorber minus the compressor work.
