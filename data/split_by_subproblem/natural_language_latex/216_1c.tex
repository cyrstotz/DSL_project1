The rate of entropy generation, denoted as S dot with subscript 'erf', equals the sum over j of the rate of heat transfer Q dot subscript j divided by the temperature T subscript j, through conversion.

The rate of entropy generation, denoted as S dot with subscript 'ers', equals the rate of heat transfer Q dot divided by the temperature T subscript j. This equals the rate of heat transfer Q dot with subscript 'aus' divided by the temperature T, which equals 0.711 kilowatts per Kelvin.
