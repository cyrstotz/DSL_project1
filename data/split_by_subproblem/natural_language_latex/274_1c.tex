The section discusses the entropy generation related to the reactor and coolant.

- For a steady state entropy, the equation is given as:
  zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at exit and at entry, plus the sum of heat transfer divided by temperature, plus the entropy generation rate.
  Mathematically, it is expressed as:
  zero equals the mass flow rate at exit times NSE minus the mass flow rate of coolant times the entropy at entry, plus the sum of heat transfer at boundary divided by the coolant temperature, plus the entropy generation rate.

- The entropy generation rate is then simplified to:
  the entropy generation rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at entry and at exit, plus the heat transfer at boundary divided by the coolant temperature.

- Further simplifying, the entropy generation rate is expressed as:
  the entropy generation rate equals the mass flow rate times the specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of the ratio of tau at exit to tau at entry, minus the heat transfer at boundary divided by the coolant temperature.

- Finally, the entropy generation rate is calculated as:
  the negative of the heat transfer at boundary divided by the coolant temperature, which equals negative 0.165 kilowatts.
