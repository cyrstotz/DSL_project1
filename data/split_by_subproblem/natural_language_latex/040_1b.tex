The rate of heat transfer, denoted as Q dot subscript KF, equals the integral from s subscript a to s subscript e of T ds.

Here, the arithmetic mean can be used:
The average temperature, denoted as T bar subscript KF, equals the sum of T subscript KF,a and T subscript KF,e divided by 2, which equals 293.15 Kelvin.
