d) The efficiency epsilon_k is equal to the absolute value of Q_zu divided by the absolute value of W_el, which is equal to the absolute value of Q_el divided by the absolute value of W_el.

1. For the evaporator in the first law of thermodynamics: zero equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times the difference between enthalpy h_n and h_2 plus the heat transfer rate Q_k dot.

This implies that the heat transfer rate Q_k dot equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times the difference between enthalpy h_2 and h_n.

The enthalpy h_2 is 234.08 kilojoules per kilogram, refer to Table A-10.

The mass flow rate (m dot) is calculated as 4 kilograms per hour, converted to kilograms per second, and multiplied by the difference in enthalpy (234.08 minus 93.42) kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in 156.3 watts.

Therefore, the efficiency epsilon_k is calculated as 156.3 watts divided by 28 watts, which equals approximately 5.582.
