Graph Description: The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The y-axis is labeled T in Kelvin and the x-axis is labeled S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. There are three isobars drawn as curved lines, labeled 0.15 bar, 0.5 bar, and an unlabeled isobar. There are six points labeled 1 through 6, connected by lines indicating processes. The points are connected as follows: from point 1 to point 2, from point 2 to point 3, from point 3 to point 4, from point 4 to point 5, and from point 5 to point 6. The points 1 and 6 are on the 0.15 bar isobar, points 2 and 5 are on the 0.5 bar isobar, and points 3 and 4 are on the unlabeled isobar.
