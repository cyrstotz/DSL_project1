Assume energy conservation in system 1, which is stationary.

The equation is:
mass flow rate of 1 times (half of u2 squared plus h subscript e2) minus mass flow rate of 1 times (half of u1 squared plus h subscript e1) equals zero.

Friction is missing here with T subscript s equals 433.14 from Table A-22 and here u subscript tp equals 0.5 meters per second.

The equation for h subscript e2 (39.94 kilojoules per kilogram) is:
h subscript e2 (40.04) divided by 104 minus 1.134 times h subscript e1 (40.04) equals 133.36.

The equation for h subscript a (0.05 meters per second) is:
(h subscript a (0.5472) minus h subscript a (0.4630)) divided by (0.5472 minus 0.4630) times (0.5 minus 0.4630) plus h subscript a (0.4630) equals.
