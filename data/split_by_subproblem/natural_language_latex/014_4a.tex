The description includes two graphs:

1. The left graph displays pressure \( P \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. It features multiple curves that show varying peaks and troughs, which indicate different phases or states.

2. The right graph also displays pressure \( P \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. This graph identifies three distinct regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "gas." There are two points marked on the graph: point "1" and point "2," with an arrow pointing from point 1 to point 2. The region between the solid and liquid phases is shaded with diagonal lines. Additionally, the point where the three phases meet is labeled as "Sublimation point."
