Energy balance around the entire engine:
The derivative of the energy flow rate with respect to time equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the inlet specific enthalpy and the outlet specific enthalpy plus half the square of the velocity at the inlet minus half the square of the velocity at the outlet.
Zero equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between the inlet and outlet plus half the square of the velocity at the inlet minus half the square of the velocity at the outlet.
The difference between the inlet specific enthalpy and the outlet specific enthalpy equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between the inlet and outlet.

Energy balance around the jet nozzle:
Zero equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between the state before the nozzle and the outlet plus half the square of the velocity at the outlet minus half the square of the velocity at the outlet.
Zero equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between the inlet and outlet plus half the square of the velocity at the inlet equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between the state before the nozzle and the outlet plus half the square of the velocity at the outlet.
