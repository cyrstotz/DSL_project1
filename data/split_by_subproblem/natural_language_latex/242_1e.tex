The change in entropy, denoted as Delta S_12, is calculated as m_2 times s_2 minus m_1 times s_1. This implies that m_2 equals m_1 plus Q_zu, which equals 8572.45 kilograms.

The entropy s_2 at 70 degrees Celsius is equal to s_f at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 0.95 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The entropy s_1 is equal to s_f at 100 degrees Celsius plus 0.005 times the difference between s_g at 100 degrees Celsius and s_f at 100 degrees Celsius, resulting in 1.3374 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Therefore, the change in entropy, Delta S_12, is 1388.2 kilojoules per Kelvin.
