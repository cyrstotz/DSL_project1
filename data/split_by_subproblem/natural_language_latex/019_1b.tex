One over I equals the integral from T1 to T2 of T dS divided by Sa2 minus Sa1, which equals 9 kilowatts minus 2 kilowatts divided by Sa2 minus Sa1, which equals T2 minus T1 divided by the natural logarithm of T2 divided by T1.

T2 minus T1 divided by the natural logarithm of T2 divided by T1.

T2 equals 282.15 Kelvin.

T1 equals 283.15 Kelvin.

Equals 233.12 Kelvin.
