The graph description includes a plot with the x-axis labeled as s in cubic meters per kilogram and the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin. The graph features several points and lines:
- Point O is at the origin.
- Point 1 is slightly above and to the right of point O.
- Point 2 is above and to the right of point 1.
- Point 3 is above and to the right of point 2.
- Point 4 is below and to the right of point 2.
- Point 5 is above and to the right of point 4.
- Point 5' is slightly above and to the right of point 5.
- Point P2 is located between points 2 and 3.
- Point P0 is to the right of point 5'.
The lines on the graph include:
- A solid line connecting points O, 1, 2, 3, P2, 5, and 5'.
- A dashed line connecting points O, 4, 5, and P0.

The equations provided are as follows:
- The rate of energy change for a stream x is given by the equation: the rate of energy change equals the mass flow rate of x times the enthalpy of x minus the reference temperature times the difference in entropy of x and the reference entropy plus the change in kinetic energy.
- The change in kinetic energy is calculated as half the difference between the square of the angular velocity and the square of the radius at point 2 and the square of the angular velocity and the square of the radius at point 1.
- The change in specific energy for the stream x is given by the equation: the change equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature at points 6 and 0 minus the reference temperature times the specific heat at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature at point 6 to the reference temperature plus the change in kinetic energy.
- The change in specific energy for the stream x is numerically calculated as 122.21 kilojoules per kilogram.
