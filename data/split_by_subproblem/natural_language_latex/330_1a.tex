Energy balance in the water in the reactor:

SFP: The rate of heat transfer Q dot equals the mass flow rate m dot times the difference between the enthalpy at exit h_e and the enthalpy at entry h_alpha, plus the heat added Q_R dot, minus the heat lost Q_aus dot.

The heat lost Q_aus dot equals the mass flow rate m dot times the difference between the enthalpy of water at exit h_e^H2O and the enthalpy of water at entry h_alpha^H2O, plus the heat added Q_R dot.

The enthalpy at exit h_e is equal to the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius, from table TAB-A2, which is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at entry h_alpha is equal to the enthalpy at 700 degrees Celsius, which is 919.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat lost Q_aus dot is 62.18 kilowatts.
