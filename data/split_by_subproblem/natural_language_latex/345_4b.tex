The rate of change of kinetic energy, denoted as W dot subscript K, equals the mass flow rate of KN, denoted as m dot subscript KN, multiplied by the difference in enthalpy h2 minus h3.

The entropy at state 2, s2, equals the entropy at state 3, s3.

The pressure p subscript i equals 1 millibar, and the temperature T subscript i equals negative 10 degrees Celsius.

The temperature at state 2, T2, equals negative 22 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy at state 2, h2, equals 234.08 kilojoules per kilogram, and the entropy at state 2, s2, equals 0.935 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, as referenced from Table A-10.

The enthalpy at state 3, h3, is calculated as 267.75 plus the difference between 273.66 and 267.75, resulting in 272.95 kilojoules per kilogram.

The entropy at state 2, s2, equals 0.2066, and the difference between 0.9379 and 0.2066, as referenced from Table A-12.

The mass flow rate of KN, m dot subscript KN, equals 0.37 kilograms per hour.
