The pure heat transfer \( Q_{\text{aus rein}} \) leads to a reversible process, hence the total entropy change \( S_{\text{tot}} \) equals zero.

The heat \( Q \) is equal to the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference in entropy \( s_1 - s_2 \) plus the heat transfer \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) divided by the temperature \( T \), leading to an average temperature \( \overline{T} \) which equals \( \dot{m} \) times \( s_2 - s_1 \) plus the rate of heat transfer \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \).

The heat \( Q \) is also equal to the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference in internal energy \( u_{EF1} - u_{EF2} \) plus the heat transfer \( Q_{\text{aus}} \).

The ratio of the heat transfer \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) to the difference in internal energy \( u_{EF1} - u_{EF2} \) equals the product of the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) and the average temperature \( \overline{T} \).

The ratio of the heat transfer \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) to the exponential of the temperature difference \( (T_1 - T_2) \) over \( T_1 \) equals the product of the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) and the exponential of the temperature difference \( (T_1 - T_2) \) over \( T_1 \).

The average temperature \( \overline{T} \) is calculated as the reciprocal of the ratio of \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) to the exponential of \( T_2 \) over \( T_1 \), which simplifies to \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) divided by the exponential of the temperature difference \( (T_1 - T_2) \) over \( T_1 \), and further simplifies to the temperature difference \( (T_1 - T_2) \) divided by the natural logarithm of the ratio \( T_2 \) over \( T_1 \), resulting in \( 293.12 \) Kelvin.
