Heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) between energy balance 1-2: \( dE = \sum \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W} \) (closed system).

The rate of change of internal energy plus kinetic energy plus potential energy equals the heat transfer \( \Delta Q \) (with \( T_2 \) from the problem statement).

The change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2, \( \Delta U_{12} \), equals the heat transfer \( \Delta Q_{12} \), which results in \( \Delta u_{1,2} = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} c_{p} \, dT = c_{p} (T_2 - T_1) \).

The change in specific internal energy from state 1 to state 2 is \( 0.633 - (-0.003) = 0.636 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).

The change in heat transfer per unit mass \( \Delta q_{12} \) is \( 0.0019 \, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{kg}} \), leading to \( m \cdot \Delta s_{12} = 1.2 \, \text{kg} \).

This equals 1900 transferred between gas and EW (external work).
