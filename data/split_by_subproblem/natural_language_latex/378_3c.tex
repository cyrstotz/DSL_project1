The temperature T subscript 3,2 equals 0.005 degrees Celsius.

The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times some expression, plus the heat flow rate in, minus the work done by volume.

The change in energy minus the mass of gas times the change in internal energy is equal to the mass of gas times the specific heat at constant volume times the difference between temperature T2 and T1.

If the work done by volume is constant pressure, then the ratio of temperature T2 to T1 is equal to the ratio of volume V2 to V1, which implies that volume V2 equals 1.109 liters.

The work done by volume is equal to the difference in volume V2 minus V1 times the density, which equals negative 284.28 Joules.

This implies that the heat flow rate in equals negative 1082.96 kilojoules plus 284.28, which equals negative 798.68 Joules minus 1367.24 Joules.

This implies that the absolute value of the heat flow rate in is 137.26 Joules.
