The graph has a title at the top left corner labeled as "h(T2)". The x-axis is labeled as "[T/K]" and the y-axis is labeled as "h". There are two points marked on the y-axis: one at the origin, which is zero, and another at a higher value, which is one. There are two points marked on the x-axis: one at the origin, which is zero, and another at a higher value, which is two. The graph contains a curve that starts from the origin, oscillates, and then follows a roughly linear path upwards.
