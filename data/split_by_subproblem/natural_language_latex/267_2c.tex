The text contains three mathematical expressions:

1. "mil. \( w_6^2 = 50 \frac{m^2}{s^2} \)" translates to "The square of w six equals fifty meters squared per second squared."

2. The second expression is:
   \( e_{ex,st} = h_6 - h_0 - T_0 ( s_6 - s_0 ) + \frac{1}{2} ( w_6^2 - w_0^2 ) \)
   This translates to "e ex st equals h six minus h zero minus T zero times the difference of s six and s zero plus one-half times the difference of the square of w six and the square of w zero."

3. The third expression is broken into two parts:
   \( = n c_v ( T_1 - T_0 ) - T_0 c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_1}{T_0} \right) - T_0 c_p \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) + \frac{1}{2} ( w_6^2 - w_0^2 ) \)
   This translates to "equals n times c v times the difference of T one and T zero minus T zero times c p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T one to T zero minus T zero times c p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p six to p zero plus one-half times the difference of the square of w six and the square of w zero."

   \( = 727.67 \frac{kJ}{kg} \)
   This translates to "equals seven hundred twenty-seven point six seven kilojoules per kilogram."
