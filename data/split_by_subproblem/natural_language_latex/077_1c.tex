Entropy balance:
The rate of change of entropy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times the entropy at the inlet plus the sum of the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature at each point plus the generated entropy.

Adiabatic implies zero.

Further:

Equation one:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between entropy at point one and entropy at point two plus the generated entropy.

Equation two:
The generated entropy equals the mass flow rate times the difference between entropy at point two and entropy at point one, where S2 and S1 are present as boiling liquids.

Equation three:
The entropy at point two at 100 degrees Celsius is 1.306 gigajoules.

Equation four:
The entropy at point one at 70 degrees Celsius is 0.959 gigajoules.

Equation five:
The generated entropy equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 1.306 gigajoules per kilogram-kelvin and 0.959 gigajoules per kilogram-kelvin.

Final equation:
This equals the absolute value of 0.1056 gigajoules per kelvin-second, which is equivalent to the absolute value of 105.6 megajoules per kelvin-second.
