A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as T degrees Celsius and the y-axis labeled as p (bar). The graph shows a curve labeled as "Triple point" which intersects the y-axis at a point labeled "i)" and the x-axis at a point labeled "ii)". Another curve labeled as "Phase boundary" starts from the point "i)" and moves towards the right, approaching the x-axis asymptotically. The point "i)" is marked on the curve "Phase boundary" and the point "ii)" is marked on the x-axis. The region to the left of the curve "Phase boundary" is labeled as "(solid)" and the region to the right is labeled as "(liquid)". The region below the curve "Triple point" is labeled as "(gaseous)".
