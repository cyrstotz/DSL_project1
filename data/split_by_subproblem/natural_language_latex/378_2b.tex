Thrust nozzle:
The velocity v_5 is 220 meters per second, the pressure p_5 is 0.56 bar, and the temperature T_1 is 431 Kelvin.

The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate at point 5 times the difference in enthalpy between points 5 and 6 plus half the difference of the squares of the velocities at points 6 and 5, plus the heat added minus the work done by the system.

Considering a reversible and adiabatic thrust nozzle, which is isentropic with n equals 1.4,

The change in enthalpy is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperatures between T_5 and T_c, which results in a change in enthalpy of 10.4 times 4.88 kilojoules per kilogram.

The temperature T_c is calculated as T_5 times the ratio of pressure p_0 to p_1 raised to the power of (n-1) divided by n, resulting in 328.07 Kelvin.

The enthalpy at point 5 is equal to the product of the mass flow rate, a constant mass flow rate factor, time, and the mass flow rate at point 5. Consequently, the constant mass flow rate factor is equal to itself times time and the mass flow rate at point 5.

The velocity W_q is calculated as the square root of the square of the exit velocity plus twice the change in enthalpy, resulting in 498.29 meters per second.
