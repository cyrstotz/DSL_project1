The average temperature T-bar subscript KF equals the integral from s1 to s2 of T dS over s2 minus s1, which equals the integral from 1 to 2 of dq over c subscript LF times the natural logarithm of T2 over T1, which equals q12 over c subscript LF times T2 over T1, which equals h2 minus h1 over c subscript LF times T2 over T1.

The derivative of Z-dot superscript o with respect to t equals m-dot times h1 minus h2 plus Q-dot subscript aus minus W-dot superscript o subscript n.

h2 minus h1 equals negative Q-dot subscript aus over m-dot.
