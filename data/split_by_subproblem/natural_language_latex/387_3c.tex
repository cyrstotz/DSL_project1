c) The temperature T_2s equals zero degrees Celsius, which implies that the minimum heat Q_mind is 1.082 kilojoules, as one article suggests that this is greater than Q_out.

c) Q from 1 to 2

See last task:
The heat transfer Q from state 1 to state 2 is given by the equation:

Change in internal energy Delta U equals heat Q minus work W.

The work W from state 1 to state 2 is given by the formula:
W from 1 to 2 equals R times (T_2 minus T_1) divided by (1 minus n).

Where n equals the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure c_p to specific heat at constant volume c_v, which is 1.286, leading to the number 6.

The specific heat at constant pressure c_p equals the gas constant R plus the specific heat at constant volume c_v, which equals 799 Joules per kilogram Kelvin, leading to the number 2.

This results in a value of -316.5 Joules per kilogram.

The work W from 1 to 2 equals -1.082 Joules per kilogram.

The change in internal energy Delta U equals the specific heat at constant volume c_v times (T_2 minus T_1) times the mass m, which equals 866.38 Joules per kilogram.

Thus, the heat transfer Q from 1 to 2 equals 1.945 Joules per kilogram.
