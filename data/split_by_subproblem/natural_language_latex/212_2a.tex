Graph description:
The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled temperature in Kelvin.
There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
The curve starts at point 0, goes down to point 1, then to point 2, and then to point 3.
From point 3, it curves up to point 4, then to point 5, and finally to point 6.
The region between points 0, 1, and 2 is shaded.
The region between points 3, 4, 5, and 6 is shaded.
The curve between points 0 and 1 is labeled "isotherm".
The curve between points 1 and 2 is labeled "isotherm".
The curve between points 2 and 3 is labeled "isotherm".
The curve between points 3 and 4 is labeled "isotherm".
The curve between points 4 and 5 is labeled "isotherm".
The curve between points 5 and 6 is labeled "isotherm".
The curve between points 0 and 6 is labeled "beve line".
