c) The temperature \( T_{gj2} \) is 0.002 degrees Celsius.

Energy balance around the gas: Closed, at the piston

The equation \( m_j (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{k2} - W_v \) represents the energy balance, where \( m_j \) is the mass flow rate, \( u_2 \) and \( u_1 \) are the internal energies at states 2 and 1 respectively, \( Q_{k2} \) is the heat transfer, and \( W_v \) is the work done.

The work done \( W_v \) is given by \( W_v = R \frac{(T_{2g} - T_{1g})}{1 - n} \), where \( R \) is the gas constant, \( T_{2g} \) and \( T_{1g} \) are the temperatures at states 2 and 1 respectively, and \( n \) is a constant.

The equation \( m_j c_v (T_{2g} - T_{1g}) + W_v = Q_{k2} \) relates the mass flow rate, specific heat at constant volume \( c_v \), temperature change, work done, and heat transfer.

The constant \( n \) is the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure \( c_p \) to specific heat at constant volume \( c_v \), which equals 1.2626.

The specific heat at constant pressure \( c_p \) is calculated as \( c_p = \frac{R}{m_j} + c_v = 0.29228 \).
