The question asks for the value of Q_{12}, which is unknown.

The temperature T_{g,2} is given as 0.003 degrees Celsius.

The value of Q_{12} is calculated as the change in enthalpy, Delta h_2, which equals C_p times the difference in temperatures T_2 minus T_1. Substituting the values, it is 0.7993 times (0.003 minus 500), which equals negative 399.65 kilojoules.

The value of z is unknown.
