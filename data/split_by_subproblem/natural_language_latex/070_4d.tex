The energy efficiency ratio, denoted as E_ic, is calculated as the ratio of Q_ev over the difference of Q_ic minus W_t, which simplifies to the ratio of Q_ic over W_t. Substituting the values, Q_ic is 120.3 and W_t is 28, the calculation yields E_ic equals 120.3 divided by 28, which equals approximately 4.476.
