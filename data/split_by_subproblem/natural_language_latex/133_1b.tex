The rate of change of entropy for the Carnot cycle, denoted as S dot subscript TKF, is equal to the integral from s subscript A to s subscript C of T ds, divided by s subscript A minus s subscript C. This is equal to one over s subscript A minus s subscript C times the quantity T subscript A squared over two minus T subscript C squared over two.

s subscript A minus s subscript C equals c times the natural logarithm of the ratio T subscript 2 over T subscript 1.
