The equation is zero equals m dot times the quantity of h sub c minus h sub a plus the quantity of w sub c squared minus w sub a squared all over two.

h sub s at 0.05 bar and 437.3 Kelvin.

n equals 1.4.

The ratio of T sub 6 over T sub 5 equals the ratio of p sub 6 over p sub 5 raised to the power of (n minus 1) over n, which leads to T sub 6 equals T sub 5 times the ratio of p sub 6 over p sub 5 raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4.

c sub p equals 1.006 Joules per kilogram Kelvin equals 437.3 Kelvin times the ratio of 0.05 over 0.1 raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 equals 254.1 Kelvin.

h sub s minus h sub c equals the integral from T sub 5 to T sub 6 of c sub p dT, which equals T sub 5 minus T sub 6 times c sub p.

This equals 1.006 Joules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference of 437.3 Kelvin minus 254.1 Kelvin equals 138.2 kilograms per second.

Zero equals m dot times the quantity of 138.2 kilograms per second plus the quantity of 202.5 meters per second squared minus w squared all over two.
