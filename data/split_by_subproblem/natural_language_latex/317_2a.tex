Graph Description:

The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as T (temperature) and the x-axis labeled as s [kJ/kgÂ·K] (entropy). The plot contains a cycle with six points labeled 1 through 6. The cycle is described as follows:

- From Point 1 to Point 2: A vertical line labeled "isentrop".
- From Point 2 to Point 3: An upward sloping line labeled "isobar".
- From Point 3 to Point 4: A horizontal line.
- From Point 4 to Point 5: A vertical line labeled "isentrop".
- From Point 5 to Point 6: A downward sloping line.
- From Point 6 to Point 1: A curved line with a zigzag pattern indicating some form of complex process.
