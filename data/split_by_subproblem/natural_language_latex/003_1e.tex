The change in entropy, denoted as Delta s, is equal to m subscript 2 times s subscript 2 minus m subscript 1 times s subscript 1. This is further equal to the sum of Delta m subscript i times s subscript i plus the sum from i to j of Q subscript i superscript o divided by T subscript i, plus Ser subscript 2.

Ser subscript 2 is equal to Delta m subscript 2 times s subscript n2.
