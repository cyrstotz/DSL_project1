The mass flow rate of R134a is denoted as m-dot subscript R134a.

The equation zero equals m-dot subscript R134a times the difference of h subscript 2 minus h subscript 3, minus W-dot subscript k.

The equation h subscript 2 times the fraction f over g minus h subscript g equals nothing on the right side.

The power W-dot subscript k equals 28 watts.
