For an ideal fluid, the change in enthalpy, denoted as delta h, is equal to the integral from temperature T1 to T2 of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (c_if) with respect to temperature T, under isobaric conditions.

For a semi-open system in the first law of thermodynamics, the equation is given by:
mass times the change in internal energy (u2 minus u1) equals the mass flow rate (dot m) times the difference in enthalpy at the inlet and outlet (h_ein minus h_aus) plus the heat transfer rate out of the system (dot Q_aus) minus the work done by the system (dot W).
