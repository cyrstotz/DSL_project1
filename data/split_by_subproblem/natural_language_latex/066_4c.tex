Assumption: mass flow rate, m dot, equals 4 kilograms per hour, and the saturation temperature, T_se, equals 52 degrees Celsius.
We need to find x_1.

From T&B A-10, the enthalpy of vaporization, h_g, at 52 degrees Celsius is 234.28 kilojoules per kilogram.
(We know h_4 equals 93.49 kilojoules per kilogram.)
And from T&B A-10, the pressure, p_4, at 52 degrees Celsius is 1.24992 bar, which equals p_2.

Enthalpies h_2 and h_3 from T&B A-10:
h_g2 equals 234.28 kilojoules per kilogram.
h_f2 equals 93.49 kilojoules per kilogram.

x_1 is calculated as (h_1 minus h_f2) divided by (h_g2 minus h_f2), with h_4 equals 93.49.

Therefore, x_1 equals 0.3375.
