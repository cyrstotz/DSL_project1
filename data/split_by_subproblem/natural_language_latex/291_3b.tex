The pressure \( p g_2 \) equals the pressure \( p g_1 \) because the same weight is still pressing on the gas.
The pressure \( p g_2 \) equals 14 bar.
The temperature \( T g_2 \) equals the temperature \( T g_1 \) according to the ideal gas law.
The temperature remains the same when pressure \( p \) is constant and volume \( V \) is constant.
The pressure \( p g_2 \) equals 0 degrees.
The volume does not increase.
