The graph is a Pressure-Entropy (P-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as entropy in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled as pressure. The graph consists of six points labeled 1 through 6. The process between points 1 and 2 is a vertical line labeled "isothermal compression". The process between points 2 and 3 is a diagonal line labeled "isobaric heat addition". The process between points 3 and 4 is a vertical line labeled "adiabatic, irreversible turbine". The process between points 4 and 5 is a horizontal line labeled "isobaric mixing chamber". The process between points 5 and 6 is a vertical line labeled "isothermal nozzle". There are dashed lines indicating isobars and isotherms.
