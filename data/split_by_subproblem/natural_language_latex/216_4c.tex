In R134a:
- The specific volume of the refrigerant, denoted as v_kg, is equal to 4 kg divided by V.
- The temperature T is minus 22 degrees Celsius.

In the throttle:
- The enthalpy h2 equals h4.

Table A 11:
- The enthalpy h_g1 at 8 bar and quality x equals 0 is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The enthalpy h3 at 8 bar is not specified.
- The entropy s2 equals s3.

Further calculations:
- The enthalpy h4 is equal to h_f1 plus x times the difference between h_g1 and h_f1.
- The quality x is calculated as (h1 minus h_f2) divided by (h_g2 minus h_f2), which equals the enthalpy h2 at minus 22 degrees Celsius and quality x equals 1, divided by the enthalpy h_g1 at minus 10 degrees Celsius and quality x equals 1, resulting in 1 over 400 kilograms per second.

The energy EK is equal to the heat input Qzu divided by V4, which equals 5787.
