W6 and T6 equals what? W5 equals 220 meters per second. p0 equals pc equals 0.191 bar. p5 equals 0.5 bar. T5 equals 431.9 units. For an ideal gas, the ratio of T6 to T5 equals the ratio of p6 to p5 raised to the power of (n-1) over n. Therefore, T6 equals the ratio of p6 to p5 raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 times T5, which equals 328.0746565 units.

In a steady process, the total mass flow rate times the sum of the change in enthalpy and half the difference of the squares of omega G and omega 5, plus the sum of heat transfer rates minus the sum of work rates equals zero. Therefore, the change in enthalpy equals half the difference of the squares of omega 0 and omega 5. The change in enthalpy equals the integral from T5 to TG of cp dT, which equals cp times the difference of the logarithms of TG and T5, which equals -0.27 plus 66024 Kelvin per Joule. 0.27 times 66024 times 2 plus omega 5 squared equals omega G squared equals 48400.553 square meters per second squared. Therefore, omega G equals the square root of the previous result. The change in enthalpy equals the integral from T5 to TG of cp dT, which equals cp times the difference of TG and T5, which equals -104.448 Kelvin per Joule. Therefore, twice the change in enthalpy plus omega 5 squared equals omega G squared equals 252294.912 square meters per second squared. Omega G equals 504.2454159 meters per second.
