The graph description includes a plot with the x-axis labeled as S and the y-axis labeled as T. It features several points and lines:

- Point 1 is located at the bottom left corner, labeled T equals 243.15.
- Point 2 is above point 1, with a vertical arrow pointing upwards labeled T equals 311.9.
- Point 3 is to the right of point 2, with a horizontal arrow pointing right.
- Point 4 is above point 3, with a vertical arrow pointing upwards labeled 0.5 bar.
- Point 5 is to the right of point 4, with a horizontal arrow pointing right labeled P2 equals P3.
- Point 6 is below point 5, with a vertical arrow pointing downwards labeled 0.5 bar.
- Point 7 is to the left of point 6, with a horizontal arrow pointing left labeled P4 equals P5.
- Point 8 is below point 7, with a vertical arrow pointing downwards labeled 0.5 bar.
- Point 9 is to the left of point 8, with a horizontal arrow pointing left labeled P2 equals P3.

Several annotations on the graph include:
- c1 equals c2
- P1 equals P2
- P2 equals P3
- c1, 9 isar
- Wout equals 200 meters per second
- v/s is less than 1

Additionally, there is a table with columns labeled P, V, T, c, Q, and s. The rows are filled as follows:
- Row 1: P equals 0.191, V equals 30, other columns are empty.
- Row 2: P2 equals P3, other columns are empty.
- Row 3: All columns are empty.
- Row 4: P equals 0.5, other columns are empty.
- Row 5: P4 equals P5, other columns are empty.
- Row 6: P equals 0.5, other columns are empty.
