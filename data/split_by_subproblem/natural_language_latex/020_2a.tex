The graph is described as a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with entropy S in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled with temperature T in Kelvin. The graph includes six points labeled from 1 to 6. These points are connected by lines that represent different thermodynamic processes:
- A line from Point 1 to Point 2 represents an isentropic process and is drawn as a vertical line.
- A line from Point 2 to Point 3 represents an isobaric process and is drawn as a horizontal line.
- A line from Point 3 to Point 4 represents an isentropic process and is again a vertical line.
- A line from Point 4 to Point 5 represents an isobaric process and is a horizontal line.
- A line from Point 5 to Point 6 represents an isentropic process and is a vertical line.
Each of these points is marked with circles and labeled accordingly.
