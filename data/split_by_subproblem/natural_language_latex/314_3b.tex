The mass of gas, denoted as \( m_g \), is calculated using the formula \( m_g = m_g \frac{V_{g1}}{R T_{g1}} \) which equals \( 0.003 \) kilograms. The gas constant \( R \) is given by \( R = \frac{1}{M_g} = 0.4 \frac{\text{Joules}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{Kelvin}} \). The result is \( 3.42 \) grams.

In state 2, which is the final state, the ice water and the gas must have the same temperature, \( T_{g2} = 0^\circ C \), so that no more heat is exchanged and the system remains "constant".

The pressure \( p_2 \) remains the same as \( p_1 \), since the external conditions do not change.
