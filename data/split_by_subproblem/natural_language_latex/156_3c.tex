The susceptibility of ice, denoted as chi subscript "Eis", is greater than or equal to 70.

Determine T subscript g12 and p subscript g12.

The pressure p subscript g12 equals the pressure p subscript g1 because the water is incompressible and the melting of ice leads to no change in volume. Therefore, the process is isochoric, and equation (1) from part c) for Q subscript 12 is applicable.

For the given:
Change in internal energy U2 minus U1 equals Q subscript 12.

It implies that Q subscript 12 equals the mass of the substance m subscript g times the specific heat at constant volume C subscript v times the difference in temperature T2 minus T1, which equals negative 1.0820 kilojoules.
