The partial derivative of E with respect to t equals the sum over i of the mass flow rate of i at time t times the quantity of the enthalpy of i at time t plus half the square of the velocity of i at time t plus the product of the gravitational acceleration and the height of i at time t, minus the sum over e of the mass flow rate of e at time t times the quantity of the enthalpy of e at time t plus half the square of the velocity of e at time t plus the product of the gravitational acceleration and the height of e at time t, plus the sum over i of the heat transfer rate of i at time t, minus the sum over e of the heat transfer rate of e at time t, minus the mass flow rate at time t.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance plus the heat transfer rate out minus the heat transfer rate out, which implies that the heat transfer rate out equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance plus the heat transfer rate R.

The enthalpy at the exit at 20 degrees Celsius and 1 bar is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram, from Table A-2.

The enthalpy at the entrance at 200 degrees Celsius and 1 bar is 419.94 kilojoules per kilogram, from Table A-2.

The heat transfer rate out equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram and 419.94 kilojoules per kilogram plus 100 kilowatts, which equals 62.182 kilowatts.
