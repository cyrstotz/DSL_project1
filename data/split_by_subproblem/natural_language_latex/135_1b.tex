b) (with Q_out = 65 kW)

T equals the integral from s_a to s_e of T ds.

This equals the integral from s_a to s_e of dH over T.

This equals the integral from T_e to T_a of c_p dT.

This equals c_p times the integral from T_e to T_a of dT over T.

This equals c_p times the natural logarithm of (T_a over T_e).

This equals Q dot over c_p times the natural logarithm of (T_a over T_e).

This equals 65 divided by 2.94 times ((298.15 minus 288.75) divided by the natural logarithm of (293.75 over 288.75)) equals 293.72 Kelvin.
