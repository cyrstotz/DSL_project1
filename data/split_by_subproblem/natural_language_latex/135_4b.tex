The transition from state 2 to state 3 is isotropic, meaning that s2 equals s3.

There is a table with the following columns: State, pressure in bars, temperature T, quality x, entropy s, and enthalpy h. The rows represent different states:
- State 1 has no values specified.
- State 2 has a quality of 1 and entropy s2 equals s3, but other values are not specified.
- State 3 has a pressure of 8 bars, but other values are not specified.
- State 4 has a pressure of 8 bars, a quality of 0, and enthalpy h equals h4, but other values are not specified.

It implies x3 equals some value (not specified).

The enthalpy h1 is calculated as 77.4 h equals hf plus 36 h, which results in 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram, and this value is equal to h1.
