The average temperature, denoted as T-bar, is equal to the integral of temperature T with respect to s from S-in to S-aus, divided by the difference S-aus minus S-in. This expression is equal to q-rev divided by S-aus minus S-in, which is further equal to c-p times the difference T-aus minus T-ein divided by c-p times the natural logarithm of the ratio T-aus over T-ein. This results in a value of 293.12 Kelvin.
