The volume \( V_{\text{g2}} \) is calculated as \( \frac{R \cdot m_{\text{g}} \cdot T_{\text{g2}}}{p_{\text{g2}}} \) which equals 1.05 liters. This is further detailed by substituting \( m_{\text{g}} = 3.46 \, \text{g} \), \( p_{\text{g2}} = 1.05 \, \text{bar} \), and \( T_{\text{g2}} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \) into the formula.

The energy change \( E_{\text{g2}} \) in the closed system is given by \( E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W_{\text{v}} \).

Solution: The difference \( E_1 - E_2 \) is calculated as \( m_{\text{g}} (u_2 - u_1) - m_{\text{g}} \cdot c_{\text{v}} \cdot (T_2 - T_1) \) which results in 1.133 kilograms.

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is given by \( c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_1) \) which equals 1.4337 Joules.

The specific heat at constant pressure \( c_p \) is calculated as \( R + c_{\text{v}} \) which equals \( 0.16628 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} + 4.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} = 0.75328 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} \).
