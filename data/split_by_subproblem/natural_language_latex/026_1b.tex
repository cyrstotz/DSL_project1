Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat flow rate at the outlet.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet minus the heat flow rate plus the heat flow rate due to radiation.

The heat flow rate at the outlet equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat flow rate due to radiation.

For the section labeled "T-Az":
The enthalpy at the inlet at 70 degrees Celsius equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.
The enthalpy at the outlet at 100 degrees Celsius equals 418.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

For the section labeled "FAZ":
The enthalpy at the inlet times the mass flow rate at 70 degrees Celsius with x equals 0.005 is 364.64 kilojoules per kilogram.
The enthalpy at the outlet equals the enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius with x equals 0.005 is 421.1 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat flow rate at the outlet is 66.24 kilowatts.
The heat flow rate at the outlet is 65.05 kilowatts.

The average temperature is equal to the change in enthalpy divided by the change in entropy, since it is an ideal fluid.

The average temperature equals the difference between temperature two and temperature one divided by the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature two to temperature one, which results in an average temperature of 203.12 Kelvin.
