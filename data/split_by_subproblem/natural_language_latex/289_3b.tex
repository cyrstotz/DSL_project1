The pressure \( p_{g2} \) equals \( p_{g1} \) times \( \frac{z}{2} \) which equals 1.40094 bar.

The pressure does not change because the system is closed and the same external pressure still prevails.

It holds that \( T_{g2} = T_{ew} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)

There is still ice (\(T = 0^\circ \text{C}\)) and no more heat exchange occurs.
