The pressure p equals p sub s,4 which is 7.4 bar. The flow rate Q is 15000.

The rate of change of energy E with respect to time t is equal to the mass flow rate of vapor m dot sub 2v times the enthalpy of vapor h sub 2v divided by specific volume v, plus the heat transfer rate Q dot sub 2v minus the work rate W dot.

The change in energy Delta E is equal to the mass flow rate of vapor m dot sub 2v times the absolute value of the heat transfer rate Q sub 2v.

The change in internal energy Delta u times the mass of vapor m sub 2v equals the absolute value of the heat transfer rate Q sub 2v, which leads to 15000 divided by the enthalpy of vaporization h sub g, resulting in a change in internal energy delta u.

The change in internal energy Delta u is equal to some scribbles.

This implies that the rate of change of liquid fraction x dot sub Flüssig plus the change in fraction x minus the change in internal energy u equals 0.04, leading to some scribbles. The fraction of vapor at state d,3 x sub d,3 equals 0.9330, which is 1 minus the liquid fraction x sub Flüssig.

The difference in enthalpy of vaporization h sub g at 7.4 bar and 1.4 bar divided by some scribbles.

Below this, there are two small sketches labeled "Steam" and "Liquid".

- The sketch labeled "Steam" shows a vertical arrow pointing upwards with a horizontal line at the top.
- The sketch labeled "Liquid" shows a vertical arrow pointing downwards with a horizontal line at the bottom.
