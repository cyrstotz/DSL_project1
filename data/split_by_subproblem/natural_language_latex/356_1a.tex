The heat flow out, denoted as Q dot out, is to be determined.

The mass flow rate in, denoted as m dot in, equals the mass flow rate out, denoted as m dot out, which implies that m dot equals 0.3 kilograms per second.

From the stationary flow process:
Zero equals m dot times the sum of delta h, delta e squared over 2, and delta p over rho, plus the sum of Q dot minus the sum of W dot.

m dot times delta h plus the sum of Q dot equals zero.

The enthalpy at point a, denoted as h_a, equals h_f plus x_D times (h_g minus h_f), which equals 304.6491 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced from Table A-2.

The enthalpy at point e, denoted as h_e, equals h_f plus x_D times (h_g minus h_f), which equals 430.3253 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced from Table A-2.

m dot times delta h plus 100 kilowatts plus Q dot out equals zero.

Q dot out equals the negative absolute value of Q dot out, which equals 62.294 kilowatts.
