Exergetic balance for turbine: steady state, adiabatic process

The equation zero equals the mass flow rate times the change in exergy from state 1 to state 6 plus the term (one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the temperature) times the heat transfer rate minus the exergy rate due to velocity.

The equation (one over the mass flow rate) times the mass flow rate times the change in exergy due to the stream equals the change in specific exergy due to the stream plus the term (one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the temperature) times the heat transfer rate.

The exergy rate due to velocity equals one hundred kilojoules per kilogram plus the term (one minus the ratio of 293.15 to 1289) times 1.195 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 1009.58 kilojoules per kilogram.
