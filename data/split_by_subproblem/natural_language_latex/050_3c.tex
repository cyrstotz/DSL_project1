The equilibrium temperature \( x_{ew} \) is 0.003 degrees Celsius.

The heat transfer \( Q \) is given by the formula:
\[ Q = m_g (u_{12} - u_1) + m_{ew} (u_2 - u_1) \]

This can be expanded to:
\[ Q = m_g (c_v (T_{z} - T_1)) + m_{ew} c (T_{z} - T_1) \]

Substituting the values, the equation becomes:
\[ Q = 0.0027 (0.633 (273.153 - 273.15)) + 0.1 \cdot c \]
