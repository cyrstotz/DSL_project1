b) The equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{EW}} \) is 0 degrees Celsius.

- The temperature \( T_{B12} \) is 0 degrees Celsius.
- The equilibrium water (EW) remains at 0 degrees Celsius in state 2, as it is still in a two-phase state and is in equilibrium.
- The pressure \( p_{g2} \) is 1.4 bar, since at 0 degrees Celsius there is also a pressure \( p_{\text{EW}} \) of 1.4 bar, and it must be in equilibrium.
