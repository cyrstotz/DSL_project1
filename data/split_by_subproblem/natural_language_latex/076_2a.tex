- The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram.
- The x-axis is labeled as s in units of Joules per kilogram Kelvin.
- The y-axis is labeled as T in Kelvin.
- There are six points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Point 1 is at the bottom left, labeled with a pressure of 0.5 bar, which is the same for points 4 and 5.
- Point 2 is above point 1, connected by a vertical line labeled "adiabat".
- Point 3 is to the right of point 2, connected by a horizontal line labeled "isobar".
- Point 4 is above point 3, connected by a vertical line labeled "isotherm".
- Point 5 is to the right of point 4, connected by a horizontal line labeled "isobar".
- Point 6 is below point 5, connected by a vertical line labeled "adiabat".
- The line connecting points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 forms a closed loop.
- The line connecting points 1 and 6 is labeled with a pressure of 0.193 bar, which is the same for point 6.
