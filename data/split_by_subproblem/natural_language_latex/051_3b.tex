As long as the ice content \( x_{\text{Eis,2}} \) is greater than 0, ice is present, and the temperature is 0°C, since all the heat supplied goes into the phase transition to water and does not result in a temperature change. Therefore, the temperature must be at the melting point. \( T_{g,2} = T_{EW,2} \) because of thermodynamic equilibrium!

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) remains the same as in state 1, thus

\[
p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.9 \, \text{bar}
\]

This is because neither the external pressure \( p_{\text{amb}} \) nor the mass (\( m_k + m_{EW} \)) have changed.

\[
T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C}
\]

\[
p_{g,2} = 1.910 \, \text{bar} = p_{g,1}
\]
