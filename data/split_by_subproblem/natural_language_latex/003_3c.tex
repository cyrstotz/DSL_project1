The change in energy, denoted as Delta E, is equal to m subscript 2 times u subscript 2 minus m subscript 1 times u subscript 1, which is equal to Q subscript m subscript 2, and this is also equal to m times the difference of u subscript 2 and u subscript 1.

u subscript 2 at the temperature of 1000 degrees Celsius equals.
