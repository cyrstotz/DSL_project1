The temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is 295 Kelvin.

Entropy Balance in Heat Carrier Wall:

The entropy generation rate \( \dot{S}_{\text{ERZ}} \) is approximately equal to the heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{AUS}} \) divided by the temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \), which is approximately 210.79 Watts per Kelvin.
