The change in energy, denoted as Delta E, equals m times the change in internal energy, which is m times the difference between u subscript g2 and u subscript g1. This is equal to the absolute value of Q minus W.

The expression m times the difference between U subscript 1g and U subscript 2g minus c subscript v times the difference between T subscript 2 and T subscript 1 times m equals 1.1394 kilojoules, which is equal to the absolute value of Q.

The specific heat at constant volume, c subscript v, equals 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin. The mass, m, equals 3.6 grams. The temperature T subscript g2 equals 0.0039 liters.
