Zero equals mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 5 and state 6 plus half the difference in the squares of velocities at state 5 and state 6, plus heat flow rate minus the flow rate of volume at state zero.

The flow rate of volume at state zero equals the gas constant divided by the molar mass times the difference in temperature rates between state 6 and state 5, which equals the gas constant divided by the molar mass times the difference in temperature rates between state 6 and state 5 divided by the difference between seven and n.

The flow rate of volume at state zero equals the gas constant divided by the molar mass times the difference in temperature rates between state 6 and state 5 divided by the difference between seven and n, equals two times the heat flow rate times the sum of 273.15 minus 30 plus 4.5741 divided by the difference between seven and 7.4, equals 47.875 times the heat flow rate per second.

The heat flow rate equals the mass flow rate times the gas constant divided by the molar mass, equals 8.314 Joules per mole Kelvin times 2000 moles per second, equals two times the heat flow rate.

The flow rate of volume at state zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 1 and state 0, equals the mass flow rate times half the difference in the squares of velocities at state 1 and state 0.

The volume at state zero equals the square root of the square of velocity at state 2 plus two times the difference between the flow rate of volume at state zero and the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 5 and state 6.

The difference in enthalpy between state 5 and state 6 equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between state 5 and state 6.
