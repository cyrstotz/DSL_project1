Subsection a) Required: Heat flow rate out, denoted as Q-dot-out.

Energy Balance Equation:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at inlet (h1-in) and the enthalpy at outlet (h2-out), plus the heat flow rate into the system (Q-dot-K), plus the heat flow rate out of the system (Q-dot-out).

The heat flow rate out of the system, Q-dot-out, is equal to 0.3 kilograms per second times the sum of h1 and h2, minus the heat flow rate into the system, Q-dot-K.

From equation A-2, the enthalpy at inlet, h1, is 292.88 kilojoules per kilogram at 70 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy at outlet, h2, is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram at 100 degrees Celsius.

Substituting the values, the heat flow rate out of the system, Q-dot-out, is 0.3 kilograms per second times (419.04 minus 292.88) kilojoules per kilogram, minus 100 kilowatts, which equals negative 62.182 kilowatts.
