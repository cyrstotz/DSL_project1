The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as 's' in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as 'T' in Kelvin. The graph contains several points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected by lines. The points are connected in the following order: from point 0 to point 1, from point 1 to point 2, from point 2 to point 3, and from point 3 to point 4. There are also three curves labeled as "isotherm", "isobar", and "isochore". The point 0 is at the origin. The point 1 is slightly above and to the right of point 0. The point 2 is above and to the right of point 1. The point 3 is above and to the right of point 2. The point 4 is below and to the right of point 3.

The interpolation formula is given by:
Y equals Y1 plus the fraction (Y2 minus Y1) over (X2 minus X1) times (x minus X1).
