The efficiency epsilon K is given by the ratio of the absolute value of the heat transfer rate from the upper cycle to the work done by the upper cycle, which equals the ratio of the absolute value of the heat transfer rate from the lower cycle to the work done by the lower cycle. This is calculated as the specific heat capacity at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between T1 and T2, divided by the temperatures T1 equals 60 degrees Celsius and T2 equals negative 220 degrees Celsius. The area A is 19 and the specific heat capacity c_p is 2934 times 10 to the power of 3.

The heat transfer rate for the lower cycle approaches zero and is represented by the mass flow rate times the difference in specific enthalpy between h1 and h2 plus the heat transfer rate of the lower cycle.

The specific enthalpy h_x affected by negative x over f leads to the heat transfer rate of the lower cycle being equal to the negative of the mass flow rate times the temperature difference between T1 and T2 times the specific heat capacity, which equals negative 91776 Watts.

Again, using the specific enthalpy h_x affected by negative x over f, the efficiency epsilon k is calculated as negative 91776 Watts divided by 28 Watts, resulting in negative 3277.7.

The final value underlined is negative 3277.7.
