The equations are as follows:

1. The rate of change of specific internal energy at reference state r,0 is equal to the total rate of change of specific energy multiplied by the expression (u6 minus u3 minus T0 times (s6 minus s7) plus one-half times the square of the rate of change of angular velocity at state 6).

2. The rate of change of specific internal energy at reference state 0 is equal to the total rate of change of specific energy multiplied by the expression (u1 minus u0 minus T0 times (s1 minus s0) plus one-half times the square of the rate of change of angular velocity at state 1).

3. The rate of change of specific internal energy at reference state stiv,0 is equal to the rate of change of specific energy at state i multiplied by the expression (negative u0 minus T0 times negative s0 plus one-half times the square of the rate of change of angular velocity at state 0).
