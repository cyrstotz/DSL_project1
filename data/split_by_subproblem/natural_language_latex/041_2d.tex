The equations are as follows:

1. The rate of heat output, denoted as Q-dot-out, is equal to the sum of the rates of energy exchange due to structure, denoted as E-dot-x-str-i, plus the sum of the rates of energy exchange due to heat, denoted as E-dot-x-Q-i, minus the sum of the work rates, denoted as W-dot-n, minus the rate of energy exchange due to losses, denoted as E-dot-x-ver-l.

2. Zero equals the sum of the rates of energy exchange due to structure, denoted as E-dot-x-str-i, plus the rate of energy exchange due to heat, denoted as E-dot-x-Q-i, minus the rate of energy exchange due to losses, denoted as E-dot-x-ver-l.

3. The rate of specific exergy loss, denoted as e-dot-x-ver-l, equals h-zero minus h-zero minus T-zero times (s-zero minus s-zero) plus k-e plus the quantity one minus the ratio of T-zero over T-B times q-B.

4. The rate of specific exergy loss, denoted as e-dot-x-ver-l, equals the change in specific exergy due to structure, denoted as Delta e-x-str, plus the quantity one minus the ratio of T-zero over T-B times q-B.

5. The rate of specific exergy loss, denoted as e-dot-x-ver-l, equals 100 kilojoules per kilogram plus the quantity one minus the ratio of (273.15 minus 30) over 1285 times 1195, which equals 1069.58 kilojoules.
