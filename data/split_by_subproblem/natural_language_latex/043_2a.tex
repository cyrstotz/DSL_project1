T[s]

Verbal description of the graph:

The graph is a T-s diagram. The x-axis is labeled S in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled T in Kelvin. The graph consists of a closed loop with six points labeled 1 through 6. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isobar", from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isochor", from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "adiabat", from point 4 to point 5 is labeled "isobar", from point 5 to point 6 is labeled "isotherm", and from point 6 back to point 1 is labeled "isobar". There is a horizontal line from point 2 to point 5 labeled "MM". The pressure at point 3 is labeled as p3 equals p1 and the pressure at point 6 is labeled as p6 equals pa.
