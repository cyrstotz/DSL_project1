- Omega six, T six equals question mark.
- Adiabatic, reversible implies entropy (s) is constant.
- The ratio of T six over T five equals the ratio of p six over p five raised to the power of (n minus one) over n.
- T six equals T five times the ratio of p five over p five raised to the power of (n minus one) over n.
- T six equals 431.9 times the ratio of 0.5 bar over 0.799 bar raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1) over 1.4.
- This results in 568.6 Kelvin.
- Entropy (s) is constant.
- Energy balance:
- Zero equals m dot times (h five minus h six plus the difference of omega five squared minus omega six squared over two).
- Two times m dot times (h five minus h six) plus m dot times omega five squared over two equals m dot times omega six squared over two.
- h five at (431.9, 0.5) equals the difference of h at 440 minus h at 430 over 10 times (431.9 minus 430) plus h at 430.
- This results in 433.36.
- h six at (-30 degrees Celsius, 8.19) equals the difference of h at 250 minus h at 240 over 10 times (247.75 minus 240) plus h at 240.
- This results in 247.15.
- For an ideal gas:
- The difference h at T two minus h at T one equals C p times (T two minus T one).
- This implies omega six squared equals two times C p times (T x minus T five s) plus omega five squared.
- Omega x equals the square root of two times 1.006 times (568.6 minus 431.9) plus 220 squared.
- This results in 226.6 meters per second.
- Equals 568.71 meters per second.
