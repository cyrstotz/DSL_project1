The graph is described as a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as entropy (s) and the y-axis is labeled as temperature (T). The graph includes several isobars, which are constant pressure lines, labeled as P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6. These isobars are curved lines that start from the left side and rise towards the right side. There is also a dome-shaped curve labeled as "wet steam" that intersects these isobars. Points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the graph, with arrows indicating transitions between these points.
