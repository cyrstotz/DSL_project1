a) stationary

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat transfer rate into the system, plus the heat transfer rate out of the system.

This implies that the heat transfer rate out of the system equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet, minus the heat transfer rate into the system.

From Table A2:
The enthalpy at the inlet, at 70 degrees Celsius, is 292.38 kilojoules per kilogram.
The enthalpy at the outlet, at 100 degrees Celsius, is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

This implies that the heat transfer rate out of the system is 37.384 kilowatts minus 100 kilowatts, which equals negative 62.182 kilowatts.
(with the heat transfer rate into the system being the normal heat exchange)
