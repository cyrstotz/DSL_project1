Statement:

Entropy is generated in the wall!

- No mass flow through the wall!
- Stationary: the derivative of S with respect to t equals zero.

The equation zero equals Q dot over T plus S dot generated implies S dot generated equals negative Q dot over T sub w.

Q dot equals negative Q dot R plus Q dot out equals negative 100 plus 62.182 equals negative 37.818.

S dot generated equals 37.818 divided by 293.12 equals 0.129 kilojoules per Kelvin.

Graphical Description:

There is a horizontal line labeled "Cooling jacket" with an arrow pointing to the right labeled "Q out". Below this line, there is another horizontal line labeled "Reactor" with an arrow pointing upwards labeled "Q R". There are also some additional arrows and labels indicating the direction of heat flow.
