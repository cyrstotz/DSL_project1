1. The change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2, denoted as Delta U_12, equals Q_12, which is 1.08 kilojoules.
2. The product of the mass of the working fluid and the change in specific internal energy (u_2 minus u_1) equals 1.08 kilojoules.
3. The specific internal energy at state 1, u_1, is calculated as negative 333 plus 0.045 plus 0.6 times (negative 333.458 plus 0.045), resulting in negative 200.093 kilojoules per kilogram.
4. The specific internal energy at state 2, u_2, is calculated as 1.08 kilojoules plus the mass of the working fluid times negative 200.093 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in negative 18.29 kilojoules per kilogram.
5. The quality at state 2, x_2, is calculated as (u_2 minus u_f) divided by (u_g minus u_f), which equals 0.0568.
