b) 
- K_B12 is greater than 0,
- T_B12 is increasing,
- p_B12 is decreasing.

Subsection: as well as heat removal (ideal gas)
- The change in heat Q equals m times c_p times the difference between T_2 and T_1.
- c_p equals R plus c_v, which is equal to R over M plus c_v.

Subsection: Proof
- No friction, isotropic state change.
- The ratio of T_2 over T_1 equals the ratio of p_2 over p_1 raised to the power of (n-1) over n.
- The ratio of m over 1 equals n, which equals c_p* over c_v*, which is equal to (R over M plus c_v*) over c_v*, leading to R over M times c_v*.

Subsection: The pressure does not change!
- p_B12 equals p_B12.
