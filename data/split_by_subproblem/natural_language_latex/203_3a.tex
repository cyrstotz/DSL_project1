R equals Ru divided by mu, which equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole Kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole, resulting in 0.1663 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

p0

A equals r squared times pi, which equals (d over 2) squared times pi, equals (0.02 over 2) squared times pi, equals 0.000785 square meters.

pa1 times A equals p0 times A plus mg plus mEW times g.

pa1 equals p0 plus (1 over A) times (mk plus mEW), equals 1 bar plus (9.81 meters per second squared divided by 0.000785 square meters) times (32 kilograms plus 0.7 kilograms), equals 1.401 bars.

pV equals mRT, Va1 equals 0.00374 cubic meters, Ta1 equals 773.15 Kelvin.

ma1 equals (pa1 times Va1) divided by (RTa1), equals (1.401 bars times 0.00374 cubic meters) divided by (0.1663 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times 773.15 Kelvin), equals 3.4275 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms.
