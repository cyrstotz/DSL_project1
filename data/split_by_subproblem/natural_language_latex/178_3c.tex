The rate of change of heat Q with respect to time t is equal to the mass flow rate m dot times the difference in enthalpy h2 minus h1 plus Q.

The change in enthalpy Delta h is equal to the heat transfer per unit mass qm divided by the number of moles n.

The difference in internal energy u2 minus u1 is equal to qm.

The product of specific heat at constant volume cv times the temperature difference T2 minus T1 is equal to qm.

qm is equal to 0.633 times the difference between 0.005 and 500, which equals negative 316.5 kilojoules per kilogram.

The temperature TL is 0.005 degrees Celsius.

Q is equal to the negative of qm, which is 36,600 minus 316.5, resulting in negative 1440 Joules.
