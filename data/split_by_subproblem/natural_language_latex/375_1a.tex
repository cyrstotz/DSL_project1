Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the rate of heat added and minus the rate of heat removed. The enthalpy at the inlet for water at 700 degrees Celsius standard is given as 292.88 kilojoules per kilogram. The enthalpy at the outlet for water at 100 degrees Celsius standard is given as 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram. The rate of heat removed is calculated as 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 292.88 kilojoules per kilogram and 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram, plus 100 kilowatts, which equals 62.182 kilowatts.
