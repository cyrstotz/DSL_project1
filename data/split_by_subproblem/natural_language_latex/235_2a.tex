The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled T in Kelvin and the horizontal axis is labeled s in kilojoules per Kelvin. The graph consists of six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by various lines indicating different processes:
- A vertical line from Point 1 to Point 2 labeled "isentropic".
- A horizontal line from Point 2 to Point 3 labeled "isobaric".
- A vertical line from Point 3 to Point 4 labeled "isentropic".
- A horizontal line from Point 4 to Point 5 labeled "isobaric".
- A vertical line from Point 5 to Point 6 labeled "isentropic".
There are also two isobars labeled \( p_0 \) and \( p_5 \) drawn as curved lines. The points \( p_3 = p_4 \) and \( 5_s, 5 \) are also indicated.
