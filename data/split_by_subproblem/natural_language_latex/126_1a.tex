a) Continuous Reactor:

The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance plus the heat flow rate.

The heat flow rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the entrance and the enthalpy at the exit, which is equal to the mass flow rate times the specific heat capacity times the difference between the temperature at the entrance and the temperature at the exit.

The enthalpy at the entrance at temperature T1 is 252.18 kilojoules per kilogram, with A equal to 2.

The enthalpy at the exit at temperature T2 is 449.01 kilojoules per kilogram, with A equal to 2.

The heat flow rate equals the constant C times 3 kilograms per second times the difference between 252.18 and 449.01, which results in negative 37.8 kilojoules per second.
