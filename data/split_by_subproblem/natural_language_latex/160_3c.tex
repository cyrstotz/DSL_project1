Closed system at the piston, boundaries around the gas,

The change in energy, Delta E, equals E2 minus E1, which is equal to Q minus Wv.

Kinetic and potential energies are negligible.

The mass of the gas times the change in internal energy (u2 minus u1) equals Q minus Wv.

u2 minus u1 equals cv times (T2 minus T1).

Therefore, Q equals the mass of the gas times cv times (T2 minus T1) plus Wv.

Therefore, Wv equals the reversible volume V1 times the pressure of the gas pg, which equals the mass of the gas times the gas constant Rg times (T2 minus T1), which is also equal to pg times (V2 minus V1).

V2 equals the mass of the gas times the gas constant R times T2 divided by p2, which calculates to 0.00111 cubic meters.

Therefore, Wv equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 Newtons per square meter times (0.00111 cubic meters minus 0.00314 cubic meters), which equals -284.187 Joules.

Therefore, Q12 equals 3.422 times 10 to the power of -3 kilograms times 0.633 times 10 to the power of 3 Joules per kilogram per Kelvin times [273.15 minus 500 plus 273.15] Kelvin minus 284.187 Joules.

This equals -1367.2484 Joules, approximately -1.367 kilojoules.
