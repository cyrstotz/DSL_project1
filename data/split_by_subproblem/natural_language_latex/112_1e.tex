e) \(c_{S_{\Delta z}}\)

Energy balance of the ballistic system:

The equation for \(c_{S_{\Delta z}}\) is given by the fraction where the numerator is \(m_2 S_2\) minus \(m_1 S_1\) and the denominator is \(\Delta z\).

The equation for \(c_{E_{\Delta z}}\) is \(m_1\) times the difference \(S_2 - S_1\) plus \(c_{m_2}\) times \(m_2 S_2\).

The equation for \(m_2\) is \(m_1\) plus \(\Delta m_{12}\).
