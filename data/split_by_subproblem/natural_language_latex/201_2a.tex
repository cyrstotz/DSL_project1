a) T-s Diagram

- The diagram is a T-s (Temperature-Entropy) diagram.
- The vertical axis is labeled T in Kelvin.
- The horizontal axis is labeled s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
- There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- The points are connected as follows:
  - Point 0 to Point 1: A line with a shaded area below it.
  - Point 1 to Point 2: A line.
  - Point 2 to Point 3: A line.
  - Point 3 to Point 4: A line.
  - Point 4 to Point 5: A line with a shaded area to the right of it.

Process Descriptions

- From Point 0 to Point 1: adiabatic, isentropic, compressed
  - The entropy at Point 1 equals the entropy at Point 0.
  - The pressure at Point 1 is greater than the pressure at Point 0.
  - The temperature at Point 1 is greater than the temperature at Point 0.
- From Point 1 to Point 2: adiabatic reversible, isentropic
  - The entropy at Point 1 equals the entropy at Point 2.
- From Point 1 to Point 5: reversible adiabatic, isentropic, with the pressure at Point 5 equal to the pressure at Point 0 (isobaric).
- From Point 2 to Point 3: isobaric.
- From Point 3 to Point 4: non-reversible.
