1. First equation: The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between the exit and the ambient (h_e minus h_a) equals the power rate (dot W).

2. Second equation: The mass flow rate times 1.1 times the difference in enthalpy between the exit and the ambient equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between the exit and the ambient plus the heat transfer rate minus the power rate.

3. Third equation: The enthalpy at the exit equals the enthalpy at the ambient.

4. Fourth equation: The enthalpy at the stagnation (Staur) equals the ambient enthalpy, which is 43.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

5. Fifth equation: The ambient enthalpy equals the enthalpy at negative 16 degrees Celsius.

6. Sixth equation: X_1 equals the ratio of the mass at negative 16 degrees Celsius over the mass at negative 16 degrees Celsius, which simplifies to 1.3076 divided by 30.76 percent.
