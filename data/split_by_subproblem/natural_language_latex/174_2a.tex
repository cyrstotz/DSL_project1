The graph description includes a plot with the x-axis labeled as 's' in units of Joules per microsecond Kelvin, and the y-axis labeled as 'T' in Kelvin. There are three curves on the graph labeled as 'p0', 'pA', and 'p2'. The graph features six points labeled from 0 to 6. These points are connected by lines in the sequence from 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6. Specifically, points 0, 1, and 6 lie on the 'p0' curve, points 2 and 5 lie on the 'pA' curve, and points 3 and 4 lie on the 'p2' curve.
