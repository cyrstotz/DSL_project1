1. Energy balance at the compressor:

The equation is zero equals mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3 plus the compressor work rate.

The mass flow rate is equal to the compressor work rate divided by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3, which is equal to 28 Watts divided by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3.

The difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3, under adiabatic-reversible (isentropic) conditions, implies that the entropy at state 2 equals the entropy at state 3, which equals the entropy at saturation condition at a pressure of 8 bar, and is 0.906 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (referenced from Table A1.1).

The enthalpy at state 2, at 8 bar, is 264.7 kilojoules per kilogram (referenced from Table A1.1).

The enthalpy at state 3 is calculated as enthalpy at state 2 minus the entropy at state 3.
