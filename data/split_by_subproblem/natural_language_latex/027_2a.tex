Graph Description:

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled as temperature in Kelvin.

There are six points labeled from 0 to 6. The points are connected by various lines indicating different processes:

- A vertical line from point 0 to point 1 labeled "isotrop".
- A line with a positive slope from point 1 to point 2 labeled "isotrop".
- A line with a positive slope from point 2 to point 3 labeled "isotrop".
- A horizontal line from point 3 to point 4 labeled "isotrop".
- A line with a positive slope from point 4 to point 5 labeled "isotrop".
- A line with a positive slope from point 5 to point 6 labeled "isotrop".

Additional annotations include:
- A line labeled "same pressure" connecting points 0 and 6.
- A note indicating that the isobars are a little steep and should probably be more like parallel lines.
