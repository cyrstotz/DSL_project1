Energy balance from 2 to 3

Zero equals the mass flow rate of R times the difference between h2 and h3, plus the heat transfer rate at zero, plus the power of k.

The mass flow rate of R minus the power of k equals the mass flow rate of R equals h2 equals the enthalpy at the saturated vapor state at quality x.
