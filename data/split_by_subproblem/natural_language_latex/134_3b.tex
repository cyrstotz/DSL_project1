x_ei is greater than zero, T_g2 and p_g2 are questioned. They remain the same: T_g2 equals 500 Kelvin and p_g2 equals 1.4 bar.

The ratio of T2 over T1 equals the ratio of V1 over V2 raised to the power of (n-1) over n, since V1 is constant. No more heat is transferred when both temperatures are the same. T2 equals T1, which is 0 degrees Celsius. T2 equals the ratio of p2 over p1 raised to the power of (n-1) over n, which equals the ratio of T2 over T1 raised to the power of (n-1) over n. p1 equals p2.

c_v equals 0.633. R equals 8.314 divided by 50, which is 0.166. c_p equals c_v plus R, which is 0.789. The ratio of c_p over c_v equals n, which is 1.263. p2 equals 1.7387 bar.
