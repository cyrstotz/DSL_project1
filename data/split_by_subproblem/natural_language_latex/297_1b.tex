Description of the graph:

The graph consists of two sinusoidal waves. The first wave starts at the origin and has a higher amplitude. The second wave starts slightly to the right of the origin and has a lower amplitude. Both waves have the same wavelength. The x-axis is labeled with t and the y-axis is labeled with s. The first wave is labeled as s_in and the second wave is labeled as s_out. There is a vertical line intersecting both waves at a point labeled t_0.
