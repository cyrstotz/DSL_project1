The rate of heat transfer, Q dot, equals zero.

The total rate of heat transfer, Q dot total, equals zero and the rate of heat transfer between R1 and R2, Q dot R12, equals the total heat Q ges minus 2.

The rate of change of energy with respect to time, dE/dt, equals the sum of the mass flow rate times the specific enthalpy for each component i, plus the total rate of heat transfer, which equals zero.

The rate of change of energy with respect to time, dE/dt, equals zero.

The rate of change of energy, E dot, equals the mass of component 2 times the specific internal energy of component 2 minus the mass of component 1 times the specific internal energy of component 1.

For a totally open system, the rate of heat transfer between R1 and R2, Q dot R12, equals the total heat Q ges minus 12.

The rate of change of energy with respect to time, dE/dt, equals the sum of the mass flow rate times the specific enthalpy for each component i, plus the total rate of heat transfer, which equals zero.

The old value equals the sum of the mass flow rate times the specific enthalpy for each component i.

At 20 degrees Celsius and at 100 degrees Celsius.

The product of mass 2 and specific internal energy of component 2 minus the product of mass 1 and specific internal energy of component 1 equals the change in specific internal energy times the specific enthalpy between components 1 and 2.

The mass of component 2 equals the mass of component 1 plus the change in mass between components 1 and 2.
