The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as 's' with units in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The y-axis is labeled as 'T' with units in Kelvin. The graph contains several curves and lines:
- There are three isobaric curves labeled as "isobar".
- There are two isentropic curves labeled as "isentrop".
- The points are labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The process path is marked with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
- The points \( P_0 = P_6 \), \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), \( P_3 \), \( P_4 \), and \( P_5 \) are marked on the graph.
- The process path from point 4 to point 5 is marked with a zigzag line indicating a different process.
