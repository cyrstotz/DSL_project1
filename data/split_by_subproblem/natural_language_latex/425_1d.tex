The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to the mass flow rate from state 1 to state 2, denoted as m-dot subscript 12, times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 1, h subscript 2 minus h subscript 1, plus the heat transfer Q subscript R,12.

The change in entropy, Delta s, is equal to the mass flow rate from state 1 to state 2, denoted as m-dot subscript 12, times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 1, h subscript 2 minus h subscript 1, plus the heat transfer Q subscript R,12.

The change in mass flow rate from state 1 to state 2, Delta m subscript 12, is equal to the fraction where the numerator is the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 1 minus the heat transfer Q subscript R,12, and the denominator is the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 1.
