The first graph is a phase diagram with pressure \( p \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. The y-axis is labeled with units in bars. The x-axis is labeled with units in Kelvin. There are three regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "gas." The graph shows three lines intersecting at a point labeled \( T_{\text{triple}} \):
- A line sloping downwards from left to right, separating the "solid" and "liquid" regions.
- A line sloping upwards from left to right, separating the "liquid" and "gas" regions.
- A line sloping upwards from left to right, separating the "solid" and "gas" regions.
