The description is of a graph known as a T-S diagram. The x-axis is labeled as S in units of kJ/kgK and the y-axis is labeled as T. There are two isobars on the graph, one labeled as p0 equals p6 and the other as p4 equals p5. The graph features several points labeled from 0 to 6, which are connected by lines indicating different processes. The connections between the points are as follows:
- Point 0 to Point 1: Isobaric process
- Point 1 to Point 2: Isobaric process
- Point 2 to Point 3: Isobaric process
- Point 3 to Point 4: Isobaric process
- Point 4 to Point 5: Isobaric process
- Point 5 to Point 6: Isobaric process
Additionally, the graph includes arrows indicating the direction of the processes.

There is also a table provided with the columns labeled as "State", "T" for temperature, and "P" for pressure. The entries in the table are as follows:
- State 0: Temperature is minus 30 degrees Celsius, Pressure is 0.191 bar
- State 1: No data provided
- State 2: No data provided
- State 3: No data provided
- State 4: No data provided
- State 5: Temperature is 158.75 degrees, Pressure is 0.5 bar
- State 6: No temperature data provided, Pressure is 0.191 bar
