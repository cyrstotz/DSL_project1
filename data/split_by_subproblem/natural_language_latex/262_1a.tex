Subsection (a)

The question asks for the value of Q dot out (heat flow rate out).

**Coolant**

**Energy Balance:**

*Steady state:*

The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum of the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy, kinetic energy, and potential energy, plus the sum of heat flow rates, minus the sum of work rates.

0 equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy from inlet to outlet plus the heat flow rate in minus the heat flow rate out.

The heat flow rate out equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy from inlet to outlet plus the heat flow rate in.

**Table A-2:**

*Pure water, boiling liquid* leads to enthalpy of fluid, h_f.

The enthalpy of fluid at 70 degrees Celsius is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy of fluid at 100 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat flow rate in is 100 kilowatts.

The heat flow rate out is calculated as 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference in enthalpy of fluid at 70 degrees and 100 degrees Celsius plus the heat flow rate in.

The heat flow rate out is 62.182 kilowatts, and this value is boxed as the final answer.
