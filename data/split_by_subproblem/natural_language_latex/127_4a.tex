The graph described is a pressure-volume (p-v) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with 'v' and the y-axis is labeled with 'p'. There are four points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. The process from point 1 to point 2 is an isobaric process, which means it has constant pressure, and this is represented by a horizontal line. Similarly, the processes from point 2 to point 3, from point 3 to point 4, and from point 4 to point 1 are all isobaric processes, each represented by a horizontal line. Additionally, there is a dome-shaped curve labeled "ND" that connects points 1 and 4. Arrows on the diagram indicate the direction of the processes.

The processes from point 3 to point 4 and from point 1 to point 2 are specifically noted as isobaric processes.
