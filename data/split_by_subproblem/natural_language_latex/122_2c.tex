The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to the sum of heat, Q, minus the sum of work, W, which is equal to the mass flow rate, m dot, times internal energy, U, plus the mass flow rate, m dot, times half the velocity squared, plus the mass flow rate, m dot, times g times z, and this equals zero.

The change in internal energy for substance j, Delta U_j, is equal to the specific heat at constant volume, c_v, times the difference in temperature from T2 to T1, times the mass flow rate of gas, m dot_g, which equals 1133.4 Joules.

The sum of work for substance j, Sum W_j, equals zero.

The change in internal energy for substance j, Delta U_j, equals the sum of heat, which equals Q from state 1 to state 2, Q_12, and this is equal to 1133.4 Joules.
