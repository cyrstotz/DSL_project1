Zero equals the mass flow rate of the element times the difference between h2 and h3 minus the power of the compressor.

The mass flow rate of the element equals the power of the compressor divided by the difference between h2 and h3.

h2 equals hf plus x times the difference between hg and hf, which equals hf plus hfg.

TABLE A-12: h3 at a pressure of 8 bar equals.

T3 equals unknown.

The ratio of h2 at a temperature of negative 22 degrees Celsius to hf.

TABLE A-10: h2 at a temperature of T2 equals negative 22 degrees Celsius is 21.77 plus 212.32 equals 234.09 kilojoules per kilogram.
