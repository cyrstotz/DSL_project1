Delta ex, s.

The equation is zero equals mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between the exit and the ambient minus the product of the ambient temperature and the difference in entropy between the exit and the ambient, plus the difference between the square of the exit velocity and the square of the ambient velocity, equals negative Delta E x, st.

The ambient temperature T0 is 243.15 Kelvin, and T0 is also 340 Kelvin.

The difference in enthalpy between the reference state and the exit state equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between the reference state and the exit state, which equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times 96.85 Kelvin, resulting in 97.43 kilojoules per kilogram.

The difference in entropy between the exit and another state equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the reference temperature to the exit temperature minus the gas constant times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the reference pressure to the reference pressure.

This simplifies to the specific heat at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the reference temperature to the reference temperature, which equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 243.15 Kelvin to 240 Kelvin, resulting in negative 0.033.

Delta ex, st equals negative mass flow rate times the difference between the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in enthalpy between the reference state and the exit state minus the product of the ambient temperature and the sum of the specific heat at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the reference temperature to the exit temperature plus the difference between the square of the exit velocity and the square of the ambient velocity.
