The change in energy, denoted as Delta E, equals E2 minus E1, which is equal to Q12, and is also equal to mg times Delta u, which in turn equals mg times cp times the difference between T1,s and T0.

Delta E equals mg times Delta u.

Delta u subscript ps equals cp times Psi times Delta T.

cp equals R plus cv, which equals 0.7533 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
