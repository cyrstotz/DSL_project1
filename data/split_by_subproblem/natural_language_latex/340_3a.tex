T-bar equals R-bar divided by A.

R-bar equals R divided by A.

One over A equals one over A1 plus one over A2.

The area, A, equals a times b divided by 2, which equals 766 square meters.

The area, A, equals cosine of theta, equals G times C times T times 55 square meters.

Correctness equation: R1 times A minus the square of (m1 times m2 divided by m1 plus m2) equals zero.

T1 equals (m1 plus m2) times g divided by A.

Equals 32 times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 766 square meters plus 76 Pascals.

Equals 766 times 9.81 Pascals equals 7.507 Pascals.

Density times volume equals mass times R-bar times T1.

T1 equals 7.31 Kelvin.

Mass equals density times V0 divided by R-bar times T0.

Equals 1.2 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 287 Joules per kilogram Kelvin times 7.31 Kelvin.

Equals 0.00324 kilograms.

Equals 3.9222 grams.

For energy conservation:

The rate of change of energy with respect to time equals the derivative with respect to time of (...) plus Q-dot minus W-dot.

Mass times the derivative with respect to time equals Q.

M-dot equals M-dot1 plus M-dot2.
