The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is equal to the cooling capacity divided by L.

The temperature T12 is negative 22 degrees Celsius.

x1 is unknown.

The entropy s1 is equal to s1c, which is equal to s1,f.

The pressure p4 is 5 bar.

The entropy s1c,f at 5 bar is 0.3450.

T43 is mentioned but not defined.

The process goes from state 4 to state 1.

x1 is calculated as the ratio of (s1 minus s1,f) to (s1,g minus s1,f).

x1 is between 0 and 1, and this is related to the difference between T43 and T1.
