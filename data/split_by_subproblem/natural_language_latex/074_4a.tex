- A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as T in degrees Celsius and the y-axis labeled as p in millibars.
- The graph shows a curve that starts from the origin and increases non-linearly.
- There are three points marked on the graph:
  - Point 1 is at the lower part of the curve.
  - Point 2 is at the upper part of the curve, with a horizontal line extending to the right labeled as "enter isobar".
  - Point 3 is below point 2, with a vertical line connecting points 2 and 3 labeled as "triple point".
  - The curve between points 1 and 3 is labeled as "isotherm".
