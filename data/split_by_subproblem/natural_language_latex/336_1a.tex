The derivative with respect to time t of the sum over i of u_i plus the ratio of p_i to rho_i equals zero.

The mass flow rate times the difference between h_1 and h_2 plus the heat input Q_R minus the heat output Q_aus equals zero.

The heat output Q_aus equals the mass flow rate times the difference between h_1 and h_2 plus the heat input Q_R.

The difference between h_1 and h_2, according to the table, equals h_1 directed towards A_2.

h_1 minus h_f equals 2626.8.

h_2 directed towards A_1.

h_2 minus h_f equals 419.04.

The heat output Q_aus equals 99962.287 kilograms.
