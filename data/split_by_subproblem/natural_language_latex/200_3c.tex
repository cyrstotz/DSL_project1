The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to the sum of heat added, Q, minus the sum of work done, EW.

Delta E equals Q_12 minus W_v.

Delta E equals the change in internal energy, Delta U, which is Q_12 minus W_v.

Delta U equals the mass, m, times the specific heat at constant volume, c_v, times the difference in temperature from T_1 to T_2.

This is calculated as 3.479 grams times 0.653 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin times (0 minus 500 Kelvin).

This equals negative 1082 Joules.

The work done at constant volume, W_v, is the integral from volume V_1 to V_2 of the pressure p_1,2 with respect to volume, which equals the pressure p_8,7 times the difference in volume from V_1 to V_2.

V_2 equals the mass, m, times the gas constant, R, times the temperature T_2, divided by the pressure p_2, which equals 0.0071 cubic meters or 1.1 liters.

W_v equals negative 285.6 Joules.

The sum of Delta U and W_v equals Q_12, which is negative 796.4 Joules.

Q_12 equals negative 796.4 Joules.

The sum of Delta U and W_v equals Q_12, which is negative 1367.6 Joules.

Q_12 equals negative 1367.6 Joules.
