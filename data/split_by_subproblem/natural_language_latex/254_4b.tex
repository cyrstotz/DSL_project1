The enthalpy at state e, denoted as h_e, is underlined and equals 130.78 kilojoules per kilogram. The entropy at state e1, denoted as S_e1, equals 0.2459 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, which is equal to the entropy at state 1, S_1, according to Table A-11.

The power output, denoted as dot W subscript n, equals the mass flow rate, dot m, times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3. This implies that the mass flow rate, dot m, equals the power output, dot W subscript n, divided by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3.

The temperature at state 1, T_1, is equal to the temperature at state 2, T_2, which is minus 10 degrees Celsius. The enthalpy at state 2, h_2, equals 237.74 kilojoules per kilogram according to Table A-10.

The mass flow rate, dot m, equals 4.198 times 10 to the power of negative 4 kilograms per second.
