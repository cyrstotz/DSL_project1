Exergibility: continue calculating with 100 [kJ/kg] for the change in exergy due to the stream.

The electrical exergy is equal to the negative change in exergy due to the stream plus the product of (1 minus the ratio of the reference temperature T0 to the average temperature T-bar) and the heat flow rate Q-dot, all multiplied by 9.

From part c, 100 [kJ/kg].

The reference temperature T0 is 243.15 Kelvin and the average temperature T-bar is 128.9 Kelvin.

The heat flow rate Q-dot is 1195 [kJ/kg].

Attention, only the fraction 1/(1 + 5.293) of the heat Q-dot is transferred.

Therefore, the electrical exergy is equal to the negative change in exergy due to the stream plus the product of (1 minus the ratio of the reference temperature T0 to the average temperature T-bar) and the fraction of the heat flow rate Q-dot over (1 + 5.293).

The final value of the electrical exergy is 54.073.
