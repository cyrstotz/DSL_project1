State 2, \( T_{B2} \) is assigned \( P_{B2} \).

First Law, Energy Balance around the Gas phase:
The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy at point 1, half the velocity at point 1 squared, plus the product of gravitational acceleration and height at point 1, minus the sum of heat transfers \( Q_i \), minus the sum of work transfers \( W_i \).

Condensation enthalpy \( U_{\text{condensation}} \) is equal to the enthalpy of the liquid phase minus the enthalpy of the solid phase, which equals the mass of the gas times the difference in enthalpy between the liquid and solid phases, resulting in \( 533.413 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).

Items:
- \( Q_{12} \) equals negative 1.14 kJ.
- The absolute value of \( Q_{12} \) is 1.14 kJ.
