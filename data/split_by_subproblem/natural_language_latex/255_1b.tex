The expression is an integral of T with respect to s from s_a to s_e, followed by the fraction one over (s_a minus s_e), and the fraction (h_a minus h_e) over (s_a minus s_e) equals the fraction c raised to the power TF over e raised to the power TF times (T_a minus T_e).

This equals e raised to the power TF times the fraction (T_a over T_e) times the natural logarithm of the fraction (T_a over T_e).

This results in a value of 293.72 Kelvin.
