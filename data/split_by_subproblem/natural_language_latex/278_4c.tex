The value of h_2 is equal to 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram, which is equal to the enthalpy at the liquid phase at negative 16 degrees Celsius plus x_2 times the difference between the enthalpy at the gas phase and the enthalpy at the liquid phase, as referenced in Table 10.

The value of x_2 is calculated as the ratio of the difference between h_2 and the enthalpy at the liquid phase to the difference between the enthalpy at the gas phase and the enthalpy at the liquid phase, which equals 0.3076.
