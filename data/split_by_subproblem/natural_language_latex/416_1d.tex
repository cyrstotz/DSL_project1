The total mass, denoted as m_{ges}, equals 57.55 kilograms at 100 degrees Celsius, with x equal to 0.005. This implies that at 70 degrees Celsius, the total mass, m_{ges}, is equal to the initial total mass plus the change in mass, Delta m_{12}. Consequently, the product of the total mass and U_2 minus the product of the total mass and U_1 equals Delta m_{12} plus Q_{aus12}. 

U_1 is calculated as 418.1 plus 0.005 times the difference between 2506.5 and 2000.9, referring to Table A-2 at 100 degrees Celsius. U_2 is calculated as 232.857 plus 0.005 times the difference between 2466.6 and 252.5 at 70 degrees Celsius. 

Therefore, Delta m_{12} is calculated as the quotient of the difference between the product of the total mass and U_2 minus Q_{aus12} and 1 minus U_2, resulting in 2501.405 kilograms.
