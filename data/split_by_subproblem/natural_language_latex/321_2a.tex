The graph description includes a plot with the vertical axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the horizontal axis labeled as S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. On the graph, there are several points and lines:

- Point P0 is located at the bottom right of the graph.
- Point P3 is positioned above and to the left of P0.
- Point P5 is to the right of P3.

There are arrows indicating transitions between points:
- An arrow from P0 to P3 is labeled as 1.
- An arrow from P3 to P5 is labeled as 2.
- An arrow from P5 to P0 is labeled as 3.
- An arrow from P0 to P5 is labeled as 4.
- An arrow from P5 to P3 is labeled as 5.
- An arrow from P3 to P0 is labeled as 6.
