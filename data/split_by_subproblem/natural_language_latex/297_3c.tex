Control volume: System at the piston (EW side)

The change in energy, Delta E, equals E2 minus m times E1, which equals G12 times h2.

G12 equals the mass on the EW side, m_EW, times the difference (u2 minus u1). The pressure on the EW side, p1_EW, equals the ambient pressure, p_amb, plus the force on the EW side, F_m_EW, divided by the area A, which equals 1.46 bar.

u2 equals G12 divided by the mass on the EW side, m_EW, plus u1.

This results in u2 being -1855.1 kilojoules per kilogram.

The temperature T2_gr is 0.003 degrees Celsius.

The quality of the EW side at state 2, x2_EW, equals u2 minus u2_liquid divided by the difference between the specific internal energy of liquid at state 2, which is 208.5 kilojoules per kilogram, and u2_gas, which is 0.05 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in 0.555.
