The total rate of change of entropy, S_tot, is zero.

For a closed system:
The rate of change of entropy with respect to time is equal to the sum of the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature for each component, plus the total rate of change of entropy.

Considering the surroundings (where entropy, S, is constant), the sum of the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature for each component plus the total rate of change of entropy is given.

For an open system at rest:
The total rate of change of entropy, S_tot, is equal to the heat transfer rate from the surroundings divided by the temperature, which equals 62300 Watts divided by 293.7 Kelvin, resulting in 2 times 2.5 Watts per Kelvin.
