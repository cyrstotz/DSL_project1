For Z1:
- The temperature \( T_{g1} \) is 500 degrees Celsius.
- The volume \( V_{g1} \) is 3.92 grams.
- The pressure \( p_{1} \) is 1.3837 bar.

For Z2:
- The temperature \( T_{g2} \) is 0 degrees Celsius.

It is a closed system, and the work \( W \) is zero.

The heat \( Q \) is calculated as:
\[ Q = m_{2} \times c_{v} \times (T_{2} - T_{1}) = m_{2} \times c_{v} \times (0^\circ \text{C} - 500^\circ \text{C}) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ Q = -C_{v}(T_{2} - T_{1}) \times m_{2} \]

The heat \( Q \) is -1082.4 Joules, which is absorbed by ice water, and \( T_{2} \) is 0 degrees Celsius with a mass \( m \) of 3.92 grams.
