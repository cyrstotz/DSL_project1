The equation for \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is given by the ratio of the integral of \( \delta Q \) to the difference \( S_d - S_e \). This is equal to the ratio of \( \dot{Q} \) to \( c_{i} \) times the natural logarithm of \( T_2 \) over \( T_1 \). Simplifying further, it equals the ratio of \( T_2 - T_1 \) to \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \), which results in \( 293.1216 \) Kelvin.

\( T_2 \) is given as \( 288.15 \) Kelvin.

\( T_1 \) is given as \( 298.15 \) Kelvin.
