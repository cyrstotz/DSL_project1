m times the difference between u_2 and u_1 equals Q dot.

Q dot plus m times u_1 times the difference between T_1 and T_2 plus Q dot.

This implies that Q equals 133.73 Joules.

The rate of change of kinetic energy, E kin dot, equals p times A times the difference between v_2 and v_1 times m, which equals negative 3.724 times 10 to the power of negative 7 kilograms per second.

Because it is frictionless.

V_1 equals m times R times T_1 divided by p_1, which equals 3.1 times 10 to the power of negative 6 cubic meters per second.

V_2 equals m times R times T_2 divided by p_2, which equals 1.105 times 10 to the power of negative 6 cubic meters per second.
