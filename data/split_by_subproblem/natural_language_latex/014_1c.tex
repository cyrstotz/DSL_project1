The average temperature T_KF is 295 Kelvin.

The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at exit and the entropy at entry, plus the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature, plus the generated entropy rate.

The generated entropy rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at exit and the entropy at entry, which is equal to the mass flow rate times the specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the temperature at entry to the temperature at exit, minus the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature.

Entropy balance on the wall:

The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate times the standard entropy change from state 1 to state 2, plus the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature, plus the generated entropy rate.

The generated entropy rate equals negative two times the heat transfer rate for heating divided by the reactor temperature, plus the heat transfer rate for cooling divided by the average temperature T_KF, which equals 0.0441 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
