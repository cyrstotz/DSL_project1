The pressure will remain the same, since the pressure of the atmosphere and the weight do not change, which implies that the initial pressure \( p_{g1} \) equals the final pressure \( p_{g2} \). The temperature will drop to 0 degrees Celsius, as the equilibrium is reached. This means that both water and ice are present, which exactly occurs at 0 degrees Celsius.
