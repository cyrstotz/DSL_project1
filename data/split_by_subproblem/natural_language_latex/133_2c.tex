c) The rate of change of energy, denoted as dot E sub x, actual, error, equals the rate of change of specific energy, dot e sub x, actual, error, minus the rate of change of specific energy, dot e sub x, actual, total.

The rate of change of specific energy, dot e sub x, actual, error, is given by the formula:
dot e sub x, actual, error equals dot m times the quantity h sub a minus h sub c minus T sub zero times the quantity s sub a minus s sub c plus Delta w sub e divided by dot m, which equals 87.829 kilojoules per kilogram.

The difference h sub a minus h sub c is calculated as c sub p times the quantity T sub c minus T sub zero, which equals 85.321 kilojoules per kilogram.

T sub zero is given as 243.15 Kelvin.

The difference s sub a minus s sub c is calculated as c sub p times the natural logarithm of T sub c over T sub zero minus R times the natural logarithm of p sub c over p sub zero, which equals 0.30136 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Delta w sub e is calculated as one half times w sub e squared minus one half times w sub zero squared, which equals 75.0 plus 0.193, resulting in 75.193 kilojoules per kilogram.
