The content includes a table with four rows and four columns. The rows are numbered from 1 to 4, and the fourth row has an arrow pointing to the symbol \( Q_k \).

There are multiple identical expressions:
The mass flow rate denoted by \( \dot{m} \) with the word "four" in German, followed by arrows pointing from 2 to 3, labeled as isothermal where entropy \( s \) is constant.

In the solution section:
- The temperature \( T_2 \) is calculated as negative 10 degrees Celsius minus 6 Kelvin, resulting in negative 16 degrees Celsius.
- The heat \( Q \) is not specified.
- The entropy \( S_2 \) is calculated as 0.9855 times \( \frac{L}{L} \), which equals \( S_3 \).
- \( S_3 \) equals 0 in the product of \( T_1 \) and \( T_3 \), and \( A \) equals 9.
- The product of 7.4 and 6.4 equals 30 divided by 33 degrees Celsius.
- The natural logarithm of the ratio \( \frac{T_3}{T_2} \) is calculated as 30 plus the fraction involving 0.9855, 6.4, and the temperatures 35 and 30 degrees Celsius, divided by the difference 0.9854 minus 0.9444, resulting in 30 degrees Celsius.
