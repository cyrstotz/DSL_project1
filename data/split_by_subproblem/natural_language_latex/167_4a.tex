- The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as p in millibars and the x-axis labeled as T in degrees Celsius.
- The y-axis has a logarithmic scale with values marked at 0.1, 1, 10, and 100.
- The x-axis ranges from negative 70 to 20 degrees Celsius with increments marked at negative 70, negative 20, 0, 10, and 20 degrees Celsius.
- There is a curve starting from the bottom left, labeled as "Sublimation point", and it rises to the right.
- The curve intersects the y-axis at around 0.1 millibar and the x-axis at around negative 70 degrees Celsius.
- There is a horizontal line labeled "test" starting from a point on the curve at around negative 20 degrees Celsius and extending to the right.
- The horizontal line ends at a point labeled "i".
- From point "i", a vertical line drops down to the curve, ending at a point labeled "ii".
- The region above the curve is labeled "liquid".
- The region below the curve is labeled "liquid gaseous".
