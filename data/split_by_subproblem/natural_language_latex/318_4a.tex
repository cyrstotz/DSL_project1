- The graph is a pressure-temperature diagram, denoted as p-T diagram.
- The y-axis is labeled as p with the unit in brackets, bar.
- The x-axis is labeled as T with the unit in brackets, Kelvin.
- The graph shows a phase diagram with three regions: solid, liquid, and gaseous.
- The curve separating the liquid and gaseous regions is labeled as "isotherm".
- The curve separating the solid and liquid regions is labeled as "isobar".
- The point where all three phases meet is labeled as "Triple".
- Points i and ii are marked on the graph, with point i in the liquid region and point ii in the gaseous region.
