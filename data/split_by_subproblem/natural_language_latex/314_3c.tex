The heat transfer Q12 equals the mass of gas times the change in internal energy, which is the mass of gas times the specific heat at constant volume times the change in temperature. This is calculated as 3.42 grams times 0.623 Joules per kilogram per Kelvin times the change in temperature of 500 Kelvin, which equals negative 1082.98 Joules.
