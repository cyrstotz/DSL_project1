Graph Description:

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as 's' with the unit 'kJ per kgK'. The y-axis is labeled as 'T' with the unit 'K'.

There are several curves and points labeled on the graph:
- The curve labeled "isobaric" appears multiple times.
- The curve labeled "isentropic compression" starts from point 1 and goes to point 2.
- The curve labeled "non-isentropic compression" starts from point 1 and goes to point 2'.
- The curve labeled "isentropic nozzle" starts from point 2 and goes to point 3.
- The curve labeled "non-isentropic turbine" starts from point 3 and goes to point 4.
- The curve labeled "isentropic nozzle" starts from point 4 and goes to point 5.
- The curve labeled "isobaric" starts from point 5 and goes to point 6.
- The curve labeled "isobaric" starts from point 6 and goes to point 1.

Points are labeled as follows:
- Point 1 is at the intersection of the isobaric and isentropic compression curves.
- Point 2 is at the intersection of the isobaric and isentropic nozzle curves.
- Point 2' is at the intersection of the isobaric and non-isentropic compression curves.
- Point 3 is at the intersection of the isobaric and non-isentropic turbine curves.
- Point 4 is at the intersection of the isobaric and isentropic nozzle curves.
- Point 5 is at the intersection of the isobaric and isobaric curves.
- Point 6 is at the intersection of the isobaric and isobaric curves.
