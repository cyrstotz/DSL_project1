- p subscript g2 times mg
- T subscript g2 equals Art times Weight equals p subscript amb plus p subscript g2 equals zero
- D equals 0.1 meters
- p subscript g2 equals 1 Bar plus 0.1002 Bar equals 1.1002 Bar equals 1.1 Bar
- For mass: pV equals m times R times T, therefore m equals pV divided by RT
- V subscript 2 equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters
- T subscript g2 equals 773.15 Kelvin
- R equals R divided by M equals 8.314 divided by 50 equals 0.166 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin
- Calculated equals m subscript 1 times g divided by A plus m subscript EW times g divided by A
- equals 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 0.1 meters times 9.81 meters per second squared
- equals 1002.36 Pascals
- m equals 11002.36 Pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 773.15 Kelvin times 0.166 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin
- equals 2.692 kilograms
