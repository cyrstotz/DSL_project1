The kinetic energy, denoted as E_K, is equal to the heat input rate, denoted as dot Q with subscript 'zu', and is equal to 1.

The energy input, denoted as E_zu, is equal to the heat input rate, dot Q with subscript 'zu', repeated twice, and the work input rate, denoted as dot W with subscript 'zu', is equal to the work on the compressor, denoted as dot W with subscript 'K'.

Energy balance for the evaporator is given by: zero equals the mass flow rate, denoted as dot m, times the difference in enthalpy from state 1 to state 2, plus the heat input rate, dot Q with subscript 'zu'.

The enthalpy at state 2, denoted as h_2, from part c) is given as 234.08 kilojoules per kilogram, referenced from Table A-10.

The heat input rate, dot Q with subscript 'zu', is calculated as the mass flow rate, dot m, times the difference in enthalpy from 2500 kilojoules per kilogram to 93.62 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in 0.146 kilowatts.

The kinetic energy, E_K, is calculated as the sum of the heat input rate, dot Q with subscript 'zu', and the work input rate, dot W with subscript 'zu', divided by 3.68 kilowatts, resulting in 0.005.
