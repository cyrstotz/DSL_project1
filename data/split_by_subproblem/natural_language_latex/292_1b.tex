Item b) The average temperature T-bar in millikelvin is equal to what in kelvin?

The average temperature T-bar is given by the formula:
T-bar equals the integral from e to a of T dS divided by S_a minus S_e, under isobaric conditions equals dU divided by S_a minus S_e equals the difference of T_2 and T_1 divided by k times the natural logarithm of T_2 over T_1 equals 278.15 kelvin minus 292.15 kelvin divided by k times the natural logarithm of 278.15 kelvin over 292.15 kelvin.

This approximately equals 293.12 kelvin.
