The equation p subscript g2 equals p subscript g1 implies that the piston is still pressing from above and a balance is maintained.

In parentheses, p subscript 2 equals 1.4 bar.

Since Q dot equals zero, T subscript g2 must equal T subscript EW2.

From Table 1, the saturation temperature T subscript sat at p equals 1.4 is 0.000 degrees Celsius, which equals T subscript g2.
