The graph is a pressure-temperature diagram, where the vertical axis is labeled 'p' for pressure and the horizontal axis is labeled 'T' for temperature. It features two curves:
- The first curve is a horizontal line at the bottom of the graph, labeled "isobar".
- The second curve starts from the bottom left, curves upwards, and then bends to the right, labeled "isotherm".

There are two points marked on the graph:
- Point (i) is located on the isobar line.
- Point (ii) is located on the isotherm curve.

The point where the isobar and isotherm intersect is labeled "Tripel".
