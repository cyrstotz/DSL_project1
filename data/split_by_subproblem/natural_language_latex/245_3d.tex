The change in energy, Delta E, equals zero times U, which is the absolute value of Q12 minus W12 raised to the power of zero.

The product of the mass of the evaporating water, m_ew, and the difference between h12 and u1 equals the absolute value of Q12.

The internal energy at state 1, u1, equals the internal energy in the liquid state plus X_E5,1 times the difference between the internal energy in the solid state and the liquid state, which equals negative 200.0028 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy at state 2, u2, equals the quotient of Q12 and m_ew plus u1, which equals negative 186.4198 kilojoules per kilogram.

The fraction X_E5,2 equals the quotient of the difference between u2 and the internal energy in the liquid state by the difference between the internal energy in the solid state and the liquid state, which approximately equals 0.559.

All values of u1 and u2 are at 1.4 bar:
The internal energy in the solid state, u_solid, equals negative 333.458 kilojoules per kilogram.
The internal energy in the liquid state, u_liquid, equals negative 0.045 kilojoules per kilogram.
