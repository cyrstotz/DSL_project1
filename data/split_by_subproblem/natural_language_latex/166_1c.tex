Second Law of Thermodynamics, Steady Flow Process:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the exit entropy and the inlet entropy plus the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature plus the generated entropy rate.
The generated entropy rate equals two times the mass flow rate times the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature.
The generated entropy rate equals the heat output divided by the condenser temperature minus the heat output divided by the Textor temperature.
This equals sixty-five kilojoules per second divided by 7.3 Kelvin minus sixty-five kilojoules per second divided by 7.511 Kelvin.
This results in 0.0461 kilojoules per Kelvin.
