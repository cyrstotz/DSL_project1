The internal energy change, denoted as U2, is calculated using the formula for specific heat at constant volume, Cv, multiplied by the temperature change from T1 to T2. This results in U2 being equal to negative 331.49 kilojoules per kilogram.

The fraction of ice at state 2, denoted as X_{Eis, 2}, is calculated using the formula where U2 minus Uf is divided by Ug minus Uf. After substituting the values, the calculation simplifies to negative 331.49 kilojoules per kilogram plus 0.033 divided by negative 333.44 kilojoules per kilogram plus 0.033, which equals 0.994.
