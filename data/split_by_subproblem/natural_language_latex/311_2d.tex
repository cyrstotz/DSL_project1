The equation is zero equals the term involving the cancellation of m-dot, m-dot, and the difference between e_exstr0 and ex_str6, plus the product of the quantity one minus the ratio of T_0 over T_B and Q_B. This is followed by minus W_t minus E_xrel.

E_xrel is defined as follows:

e_xrel equals the difference between ex_str0 and ex_str6 plus the product of the quantity one minus the ratio of T_0 over T_B and q_B, which equals 849.335 kilojoules per kilogram.
