d) The rate of change of extended exergy is equal to the initial temperature multiplied by the rate of change of entropy at state 2.

The extended exergy is equal to the initial temperature multiplied by the rate of change of entropy at state 2 minus the initial temperature times the difference between the entropy at state a and state e, which equals the initial temperature times the difference between the entropy at state 6 and state 0, which equals 243.15 Kelvin times the difference between the entropy at temperature T_c and entropy at temperature T_0 minus the gas constant times the natural logarithm of the ratio of pressure at state 6 to the critical pressure.

This equals 243.15 Kelvin times the difference between 1.79819 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and 1.49811 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The extended exergy is 73.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
