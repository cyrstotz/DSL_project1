A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as s [Q/T] = [J/K] and the y-axis labeled as T [K]. There is a curve starting from point 1, labeled as "isotherm", moving to point 2. From point 2, the curve moves to point 3, labeled as "isobare". From point 3, the curve moves to point 4, labeled as "adiabat, isentrop". From point 4, the curve moves to point 5, labeled as "isotherm". From point 5, the curve moves to point 6, labeled as "isobare". There is a small diagram near point 1 showing a piston mechanism.
