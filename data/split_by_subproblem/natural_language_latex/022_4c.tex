- The rate of work done by the compressor is 28 watts.
- Energy balance around the compressor is given by the equation: zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between the exit and the inlet plus the rate of work done by the compressor.
- The process is adiabatic reversible, with entropy generation equal to zero.
- The difference in pressure between two points, \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \).
- The condensation temperature \( T_{\text{verd}} \) is equal to the initial temperature minus 6 Kelvin, which equals 4 degrees Celsius.
