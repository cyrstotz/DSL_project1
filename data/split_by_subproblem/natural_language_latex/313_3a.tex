The equations provided are as follows:

1. The pressure \( p_{s1} \) is equal to the ambient pressure \( p_{amb} \) plus the fraction of 32 kilograms times 5.5 meters per second squared divided by the square of 0.1 meters, plus the fraction of 0.1 kilograms times 5.5 meters per second squared divided by the square of 0.1 meters.

2. The mass \( m_1 \) is equal to the product of density \( \rho \) and volume \( V \) divided by the product of the gas constant \( R \) and temperature \( T \), which is also equal to the product of pressure \( p_{s1} \) and volume \( V_{s1} \) divided by the product of the gas constant \( R \) and temperature \( T_{s1} \).

3. The mass \( m_2 \) is equal to an unreadable expression divided by the product of the gas constant \( R \) and temperature \( T_{s1} \).

4. The mass \( m_2 \) is given as 44.37 kilograms.

5. The pressure \( p_{ng} \) is 1.4 bar.

6. The mass \( m_{ns} \) is 0.003242 kilograms.

7. An unnamed quantity is equal to 3.92 seconds.
