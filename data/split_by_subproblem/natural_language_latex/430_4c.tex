- A diagram with a horizontal line and a vertical line intersecting at point 1.
- The horizontal line is labeled as x subscript 11 equals zero.
- p subscript q equals 8 bar.
- A subscript q equals h subscript f divided by (h subscript g minus h subscript f) equals 93.42 per kilogram.
- h subscript q equals 93.42 per kilogram.

The equation for x subscript q is:
x subscript q equals (h subscript q minus h subscript f) divided by (h subscript g minus h subscript f).

For problem d1, the equation is:
E subscript 1 equals 1 divided by dot Q subscript zu1 minus (dot Q subscript zu1 divided by (1 divided by dot Q subscript zu1 minus 1 divided by dot Q subscript zu1)).
