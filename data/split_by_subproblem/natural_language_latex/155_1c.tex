Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at exit and the entropy at entry, plus the heat transfer rate divided by 295 Kelvin, plus the entropy generation rate.

The rate of entropy generation equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at entry and the entropy at exit, plus the heat transfer rate divided by 295 Kelvin.

This equals 0.1044 kilojoules per second Kelvin plus 6.5 kilojoules divided by 295 seconds Kelvin, all over 295 seconds Kelvin.

This results in 0.3248 kilowatts per Kelvin.
