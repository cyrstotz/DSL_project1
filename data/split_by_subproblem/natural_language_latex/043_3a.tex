a) EW translates to incompressible.

The first equation is:
p_g1 equals p_aumb plus the fraction of 32 times g over pi times r squared, where r equals 0.05.

The second equation is:
32 times g equals 32 times 9.80665 meters per second squared, as referenced from the table on the first page.

The third equation is:
p_aumb plus the fraction of 32 times 9.80665 over pi times 0.05 squared equals 1.398 bar, which rounds to 1.4 bar minus p_g1.

The fourth equation is:
m_g for a perfect gas implies that p_0 times V_0 over R times T_g equals m_g.

The fifth equation is:
The fraction of 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 times 0.00314 cubic meters over 8.314 times 773.15 Kelvin equals 0.00341943 kilograms, which equals boxed 3.42 grams equals m_g1.
