The change in exergy, denoted as Delta e subscript x, istr, is equal to e subscript x, istrc minus e subscript x, istrs, which is equal to h subscript c minus h subscript s minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript c minus s subscript s) plus Delta ke plus Delta pe over rho.

This is further simplified to c subscript p times (T subscript c minus T subscript s) minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript c minus s subscript s) plus w subscript c squared over 2 minus w subscript s squared over 2.

It implies that s subscript c minus s subscript s equals c subscript p times the integral from T subscript s to T subscript c of 1 over T dT minus R times the natural logarithm of (p subscript c over p subscript s), which simplifies to c subscript p times the natural logarithm of (T subscript c over T subscript s) minus R times the natural logarithm of (p subscript c over p subscript s).

This leads to Delta e subscript x, istr being equal to c subscript p times (T subscript c minus T subscript s) minus T subscript 0 times (c subscript p times the natural logarithm of (T subscript c over T subscript s) minus R times the natural logarithm of (p subscript c over p subscript s)) plus (w subscript c squared minus w subscript s squared) over 2.

Given T subscript 0 equals negative 30 degrees Celsius, which is 243.15 Kelvin, it implies R equals c subscript p minus c subscript v, which is c subscript p minus c subscript p over k.

Delta e subscript x, istr is calculated as 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (340 Kelvin minus 293.9 Kelvin) minus 243.15 Kelvin times (1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the natural logarithm of (340 Kelvin over 293.9 Kelvin) minus (1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin over 1.4) times the natural logarithm of (0.997 bar over 0.5 bar)) plus (320 meters squared per second squared minus 220 meters squared per second squared) over 2.

This results in -4669.79 kilojoules per kilogram.

The result is described as "Unrealistic".
