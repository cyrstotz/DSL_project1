For X greater than zero,

The change in energy for Q equals the change in energy for EW, which implies that the difference between the change in energy for Q and the change in energy for EW equals zero.

The difference between the change in energy for Q and the change in internal energy equals the product of mass, specific heat at constant volume, and the difference in temperature from T1 to T2.

The change in energy for EW equals the change in mass flow rate, which is equal to the mass flow rate for EW times the difference in temperature from T1,EW to T2,EW, and this is also equal to the mass for EW times the difference in specific internal energy from u1 to u2.
