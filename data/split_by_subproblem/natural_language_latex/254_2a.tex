The section includes a table with two columns labeled "Graph" and "Description". 

In the "Graph" column, there is a description of a graph:
- The x-axis is labeled as \( S \left[\frac{J}{K}\right] \) and the y-axis is labeled as \( T[K] \).
- There are three curves on the graph labeled as \( p = p_1 \), \( p = 0.5 \) bar, and \( p_0 = 0.99 \) bar.
- There are six points labeled from 1 to 6, which are connected by lines.
- Point 1 is on the curve \( p = p_1 \), point 2 is on the curve \( p = 0.5 \) bar, point 3 is back on the curve \( p = p_1 \), point 4 is again on the curve \( p = 0.5 \) bar, point 5 is on the curve \( p = 0.99 \) bar, and point 6 is on the curve \( p = 0.5 \) bar.
- The points are connected in the sequence: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6.
- There is a horizontal line connecting point 1 to point 6.
- There are vertical lines connecting point 1 to point 2, point 3 to point 4, and point 5 to point 6.
- There are diagonal lines connecting point 2 to point 3 and point 4 to point 5.
- The graph includes a label indicating \( T_0 = 273.15 - 30 = 243.15 \) K.
