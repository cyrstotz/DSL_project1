There is a table with seven columns labeled P, V, h, x, s, and T. The table has five rows including the header. The entries in the table are as follows:
- Row 1 is empty.
- Row 2 has an entry of 0.9294 under column x.
- Row 3 has entries of 8 under column P and 0.9298 under column x.
- Row 4 has entries of 8 under column P and 0 under column x.

The mass flow rate times the change in enthalpy equals the power output from stage 2 to 3, denoted as W with a dot subscript 23.

The mass flow rate is calculated as the power output divided by the difference in enthalpy between stage 3 and stage 2, which equals 28 Watts divided by the difference between 2717.91 and 237.74, resulting in 0.00834 kilograms per second.

The mass flow rate multiplied by 3600 equals 3.0 kilograms per hour.

The temperatures are given as:
- T1 equals negative 70 degrees Celsius.
- T2 equals negative 16 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy at stage 2 is 237.74 and the entropy at stage 2 is 0.9295.

The temperature at stage 3, T3, is calculated using a linear interpolation formula where x represents s, y represents temperature, and the points are given as (x0, y1) and (x1, y2) with the corresponding temperatures at saturation and at 40 degrees Celsius.

The calculated temperature T3 is 37.86 degrees Celsius.

Additional information includes:
- h3 corresponds to evaporation.
- x represents temperature, alpha, beta, bar.
- h3 equals 2717.91.
- y represents h.
- The points are given as at saturation temperature and at 40 degrees Celsius.
