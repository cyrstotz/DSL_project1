The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled "s in kJ/kgK" and the y-axis is labeled "T in K". The graph consists of a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is at the bottom right, point 2 is at the bottom left, point 3 is at the top left, and point 4 is at the top right. The curve from point 1 to point 2 is a horizontal line, the curve from point 2 to point 3 is a rising curve, the curve from point 3 to point 4 is a horizontal line, and the curve from point 4 to point 1 is a falling curve.
