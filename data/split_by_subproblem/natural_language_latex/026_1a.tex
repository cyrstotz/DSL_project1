Interpolation Formula:
The equation y equals the fraction with numerator y2 minus y1 and denominator x2 minus x1, multiplied by x minus x1, plus y1.

1 a)
The equation zero equals m dot times the difference of h subscript ein minus h subscript aus, plus Q dot, where Q dot is the heat transferred.
The equation for Q dot equals m dot times the difference of h subscript ein minus h subscript aus, which equals negative 37.818 kilojoules.

Graph Description:
There is a graph with a straight line sloping upwards from left to right. The x-axis is not labeled, and the y-axis is not labeled. There is an arrow pointing to the line with the label "transferred" and a symbol for heat transfer (Theta).
