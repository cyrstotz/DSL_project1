The temperature \( T_{312} \) is 0.003 degrees Celsius, which equals \( T_{EW} \).

The mass \( m_{EW} \) is 0.1 kilograms.

The change in energy \( \Delta E \) equals \( Q_{12} \).

The difference \( U_2 - U_1 \) equals the absolute value of \( Q_{12} \).

The internal energy per unit mass at state 1, \( u_1 \), is calculated as negative 0.045 kilojoules per kilogram plus \( x_{E_{1}} \) times (negative 333.458 kilojoules per kilogram plus 0.045 kilojoules per kilogram), which equals negative 200.09 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy at state 1, \( U_1 \), is \( u_1 \) times \( m_1 \), which equals negative 20 kilojoules or negative 20,000 joules.

The internal energy at state 2, \( U_2 \), is \( Q_{12} \) plus \( U_1 \), which equals negative 17,954.16435 joules or negative 17.95 kilojoules.

The internal energy per unit mass at state 2, \( u_2 \), is \( U_2 \) divided by \( m_{EW} \), which equals negative 179.546 kilojoules per kilogram.

The value of \( u_2 \) is equal to \( u_{Fl} \) at 0.003 degrees Celsius followed by a series of tildes indicating continuation or unspecified content.
