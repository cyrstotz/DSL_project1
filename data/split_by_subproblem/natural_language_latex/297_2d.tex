d) The kinetic energy at state 2 equals the kinetic energy at state 1, which is 35 kilojoules.

e) The change in thermal energy is equal to the mass times the difference in entropy between state 2 and state 1. The difference in entropy between state 2 and state 1 is the integral from temperature T1 to T2 of c over T dT, which equals c times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T2 to T1.
