The rate of heat output, denoted as Q dot subscript "aus", is questioned as to what it equals. The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, times the difference in enthalpy from state 1 to state 2, plus the rate of heat output. This implies that the rate of heat output is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy from state 2 to state 1. The rate of heat output is also expressed as the mass times the specific heat capacity times the difference in temperature from state 2 to state 1, which equals the difference between 238.15 and 288.15.
