The rate of change of extended exergy, denoted as dot e subscript ex, verl, equals T subscript 0 multiplied by the rate of change of entropy generated, denoted as dot s subscript erz.

The conditions are in dry operation.

Entropy balance around the turbine is described by:
Zero equals dot m times the difference between s subscript 0 and s subscript e, plus dot Q subscript 0e divided by T subscript 0e, plus the rate of change of entropy generated, dot s subscript erz.
This implies that everything is adiabatic except for the combustion chamber.

The heat transfer rate per unit mass from the combustion chamber, dot Q subscript 0e divided by dot m, equals negative q subscript B, which is negative 1195 kilojoules per kilogram.
T subscript 0e equals average T subscript B, which is 1289 Kelvin.

The entropy generated per unit mass, dot s subscript erz divided by dot m, equals s subscript e minus s subscript 0 minus q subscript B divided by T subscript B, which equals 1.304 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The extended exergy per unit mass, e subscript ex, verl, equals 317.15 kilojoules per kilogram.
