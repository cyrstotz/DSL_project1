The fraction of the rate of change of temperature Tf over itself equals the fraction of the difference between temperature T2 and TA over the difference between entropy S2 and S1, which equals the difference between the outlet temperature and the inlet temperature over the difference between entropy S2 and S1, which equals 8.5227 degrees Celsius.

The entropy at the outlet, S_aus, for S2 at x equals 0 and 100 degrees Celsius, equals Sf which is 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

The entropy at the inlet, S_ein, for S1 at x equals 0 and 70 degrees Celsius, equals Sf which is 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

The temperature T_KF equals the fraction of the difference between the outlet and inlet temperatures of T_KF over the difference between the entropy at the outlet and the entropy at the inlet, which equals the fraction of the difference between the outlet and inlet temperatures of T_KF over the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature T2 to T1.

The difference between the entropy at the outlet and the entropy at the inlet equals the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature T2 to T1, which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
