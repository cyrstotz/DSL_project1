Energy balance for the reactor: (steady state) (boiling water)

The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy in and the enthalpy out, plus the heat transfer rate into the reactor, plus the heat transfer rate out.

The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy in and the enthalpy out, plus the heat transfer rate into the reactor, plus the heat transfer rate out, with the mass flow rate in equals the mass flow rate out.

From Table A2:

The enthalpy in at 70 degrees Celsius is 292.98 (boiling liquid).

The enthalpy out at 100 degrees Celsius is 419.04.

The heat transfer rate into the reactor is the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy out and the enthalpy in, plus the heat transfer rate into the reactor equals 137.818 kilowatts.
