The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3 equals omega:
\[ \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) = \omega \]

The mass flow rate is given by omega divided by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3:
\[ \dot{m} = \frac{\omega}{h_2 - h_3} \]

The temperature at state 1 is minus 20 degrees Celsius, which is equal to the temperature at state 2:
\[ T_1 = -20^\circ \text{C} = T_2 \]

The enthalpy at state 2 in fluid phase is 29.26 kilojoules per kilogram:
\[ h_{2f} = 29.26 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \]

The temperature at state 3 is the temperature at state 2 times the ratio of pressure at state 3 to pressure at state 2:
\[ T_3 = T_2 \left( \frac{P_3}{P_2} \right) \]

With temperature at state 3 and pressure at state 3 equals 4 bar:
\[ \text{with} \quad T_3 \quad \text{and} \quad P_3 = 4 \text{bar} \]

In the table, the enthalpy at state 3 equals the enthalpy at state 2 in fluid phase:
\[ \text{in table} \quad h_3 = h_{2f} \]
