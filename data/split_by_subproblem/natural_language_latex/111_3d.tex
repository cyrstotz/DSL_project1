Energy balance around EW:

For a closed system, the change in energy, Delta E, is given by the expression (Q12 minus the sum of WV) times beta.

For an incompressible fluid, the change in volume, dV, equals zero, which implies no work done by volume change, WV.

The change in energy, Delta E, equals the mass of EW, mEW, times the difference in internal energy at state 2 and state 1, plus the internal energy at state 1 divided by the mass of EW.

This implies that the internal energy at state 2, UEW,2, equals the internal energy at state 1, UEW,1, plus the heat transfer Q12 divided by the mass of EW, which calculates to 200.023 plus 11.5 divided by 0.1 equals 185.928 kilojoules per kilogram.

Table 1.

The internal energy at state 1, UEW,1, equals the internal energy of the liquid plus the fraction of ice at state 1 times the difference between the internal energy of the solid and the liquid, which calculates to -0.0145 plus 0.6 times (-333.658 plus 0.0145) equals -200.0928 kilojoules per kilogram.

The temperature of EW, TEW, is 0 degrees Celsius.

This implies that the fraction of ice, XEis, equals the difference between the internal energy at state 2 and the internal energy of the fluid, divided by the difference between the internal energy of the solid and the fluid, which calculates to (-185.928 plus 0.023) divided by (-333.942 plus 0.023) equals 0.555.
