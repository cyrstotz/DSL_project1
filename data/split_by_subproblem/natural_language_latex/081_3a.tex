The equation for \( P_{g,1} \) is given by \( P_{g,1} = 100 \) pascals plus the product of \( v \) and \( g \) divided by \( \pi \), multiplied by the square of half the diameter \( D \) times \( \pi \), plus the product of \( v \), \( E \), and \( W \) divided by 3, multiplied by the square of half the diameter \( D \) times \( \pi \).

The pressure \( 100.027 \) pascals is approximately equal to \( 1 \) bar.

The pressure \( 102.7 \) pascals is approximately equal to \( 1.02 \) bar.

The value of \( P_{s,1} \) is \( 3.192 \) which equals \( 0.00319 \times 10^{-3} \).

The mass \( m \) is calculated as \( \frac{pV}{\frac{K}{T} \cdot M_{g,1}} \) which equals \( 2.5 \) grams.

The temperature \( 500 \) degrees Celsius is equal to \( 773.15 \) Kelvin.
