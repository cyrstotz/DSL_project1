The equations are as follows:

S1 equals the total mass m_ges times the sum of 1.306 plus 0.005 times the difference between 7.355 and 1.306.

S2 equals the total mass m_ges times the sum of 0.554 plus 0.005 times the difference between 7.553 and 0.554.

(Note: Values for S_f and S_g are from Table A-2, for S1 at 100 degrees Celsius and S2 at 70 degrees Celsius.)

The total mass m_ges equals 8256.205 kilograms.

The change in entropy Delta S_12 equals S2 minus S1, which is 269.53 kilograms per Kelvin.
