The graph is a phase diagram with pressure \( P \) on the y-axis labeled in bars and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis labeled in degrees Celsius. The graph shows three regions labeled "Solid", "Liquid", and "Gas". The "Solid" region is on the left, the "Liquid" region is on the top right, and the "Gas" region is on the bottom right. There is a curve separating the "Solid" and "Gas" regions, and another curve separating the "Liquid" and "Gas" regions. These curves meet at a point labeled "Triple Point". There are two points marked on the graph: point 1 in the "Solid" region and point 2 in the "Gas" region. There is an arrow pointing from point 1 to point 2, passing through the "Liquid" region, with an intermediate point labeled "X".
