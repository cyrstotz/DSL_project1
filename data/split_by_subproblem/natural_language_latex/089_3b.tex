b) 
=> Thermodynamic equilibrium => The temperature at equilibrium state 2 equals the temperature of gas 1 at state 2.

Energy balance around the equilibrium and gas:
Closed system at the piston:

The equation is:
mass of the equilibrium system times (internal energy of gas 2 at equilibrium minus internal energy of gas 1 at equilibrium) plus mass of gas times (internal energy of gas 2 minus internal energy of gas 1) equals zero, noting that only the gas volume changes.

Another equation is:
mass of the equilibrium system times (internal energy of gas 2 at equilibrium minus internal energy of gas 1 at equilibrium) plus mass of gas times specific heat at constant volume times (temperature of gas 2 minus temperature of gas 1) equals mass of the equilibrium system times specific heat at constant volume times (gas constant times (temperature of gas 2 minus temperature of gas 1) divided by (n minus n)).

**Verbal Descriptions of Graphical Content:**

1. **Diagram Description:**
   - There is a rectangular box labeled with various forces and pressures.
   - The top of the box has three arrows pointing downwards labeled as follows (from left to right):
     - mass of gas
     - mass of the equilibrium system times gravitational acceleration
     - ambient pressure times area
   - Inside the box, there is an upward arrow labeled pressure of gas 1 times area.
