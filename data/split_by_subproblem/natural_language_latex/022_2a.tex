- The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram.
- The x-axis is labeled S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
- The y-axis is labeled T in Kelvin.
- There is a dome-shaped curve in the middle of the graph, representing the phase change region.
- Two straight lines intersect the dome-shaped curve, one with a positive slope and one with a negative slope.
