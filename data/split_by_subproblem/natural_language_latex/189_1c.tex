Entropy balance between coolant and reactor:
The derivative with respect to time of the sum over i of the heat transfer rate Q dot i divided by the temperature T i plus the generated entropy S dot generated equals the sum over i of the heat transfer rate Q dot i divided by the temperature T i plus the generated entropy S dot generated.

The temperature of the coolant T KF equals 295 Kelvin.

This implies that the heat transfer rate Q dot out divided by the temperature of the coolant T KF plus the generated entropy S dot generated equals 0.21 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, which is equal to 270 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.
