For stationary flow processes, the equation is:
zero equals m dot times the quantity h subscript 2 plus c subscript 2 squared divided by 2 minus h subscript 1 minus c subscript 1 squared divided by 2, plus one half times m dot times the quantity w subscript 0 squared minus w subscript 1 squared, minus W dot subscript Diss.
