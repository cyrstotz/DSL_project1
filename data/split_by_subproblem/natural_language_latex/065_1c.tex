The rate of entropy generation, denoted as S dot e2, is equal to the mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference in entropy between points a and e, plus the heat transfer rate, Q dot E, divided by the temperature T_E. The equation is given by:

S dot e2 equals m dot times (s_a minus s_e) plus (Q dot E divided by T_E).

From Table A-2, the entropy at point a, s_a, at a temperature T_a equals 100 degrees Celsius, is 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy at point e, s_e, at a temperature T_e equals 70 degrees Celsius, is 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Substituting the values, the rate of entropy generation, S dot e2, is calculated as follows:
0.3 kilograms per second times (1.3069 minus 0.9549) kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin plus (100 kilowatts divided by 295 Kelvin) equals 0.1056 kilojoules per Kelvin plus 0.3390 kilojoules per Kelvin equals 0.4446 kilojoules per Kelvin.
