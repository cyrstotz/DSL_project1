The temperature \( T_G \) is equal to \( T_s \) times the ratio of \( P_C \) over \( P_s \) raised to the power of \( \frac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha} \), which equals 328.05 Kelvin.

The velocity \( w_G \) is equal to the square root of \( \frac{2 \alpha}{\alpha - 1} \) times \( \frac{R T_C}{M} \) times \( 1 - \left( \frac{P_C}{P_s} \right)^{\frac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha}} \).

The total mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{ges} \) is calculated as \( \frac{1.5 \cdot 100 \, m^2}{200 \, m/s} \), which simplifies step by step to \( 0.75 \, kg/s \). This calculation is repeated multiple times, each time confirming that \( \dot{m}_{ges} \) equals \( 0.75 \, kg/s \).
