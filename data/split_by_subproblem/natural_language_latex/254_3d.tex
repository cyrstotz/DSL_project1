The equations provided are as follows:

1. \( Q_{3,2} \) equals \( \Delta u \) plus \( W_{3,2} \), which equals \( m_{g,1} C_v \) times the difference between \( T_{1} \) and \( T_{\text{eq}} \) minus 284.3 Joules, resulting in 797.8 Joules.

2. \( u_{2} \) equals \( u_{1} \) plus the fraction of \( Q_{21} \) over \( m_{\text{ew}} \), which equals \( u_{E}(0) \) plus \( x_{E} \) times the difference between \( u_{E} \) and \( u_{E} \) plus the fraction of \( Q_{21} \) over \( m_{\text{ew}} \), resulting in -118.4161.

3. \( x_{E, \text{iso}} \) equals the fraction of -118.4161 plus 0.033 over -333.442 plus 0.073, resulting in 0.355.
