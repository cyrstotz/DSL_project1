Epsilon sub k equals the ratio of dot E sub nutz over dot E sub zu, which equals the ratio of dot W sub k over dot m sub rauch.

Graphical Description:

The diagram consists of a large, irregularly shaped closed curve that encompasses several equations and annotations. Inside the curve, there are two main regions separated by a diagonal line. The left region contains the equation:

Dot m equals the ratio of dot W sub k over h sub 2 minus h sub 3,

and the annotation "saturated steam". The right region contains the equation:

Zero equals dot m times (h sub 3 minus h sub 2) minus dot W sub k.

The point where the diagonal line intersects the curve is labeled h sub 2. The top right corner of the diagram contains the equation:

Dot m equals the ratio of dot W sub k over h sub 2 minus h sub 3.
