The section contains a description of a graph. The graph has an upward-pointing arrow on the vertical axis and a rightward-pointing arrow on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled with "[k] T" and the horizontal axis is labeled with "[R2 by k] S". There are three blue curves on the graph, each representing different pressure levels, labeled as "p2 equals p3", "p5 equals p4", and "p10".

Several points are marked on the graph:
- Point 0 at the bottom left.
- Point 1 slightly above and to the right of point 0.
- Point 2 above point 1 on the first blue curve.
- Point 3 above point 2 on the second blue curve.
- Point 4 to the right of point 3 on the third blue curve.
- Point 5 below point 4.
- Point 6 below point 5 on the first blue curve.

The points are connected by orange lines:
- A line from point 0 to point 2.
- A line from point 2 to point 3.
- A line from point 3 to point 4.
- A line from point 4 to point 5.
- A line from point 5 to point 6.

Additionally, there is a dashed vertical line from point 3 to point 4.5, and another dashed vertical line from point 4 to point 4.5.

The text also mentions that air as an ideal gas implies "no mass force area".
