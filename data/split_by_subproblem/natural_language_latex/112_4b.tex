The mass flow rate of R134a is denoted as m-dot subscript R134a.

Balance for the compressor is given by the equation: zero equals m-dot subscript R134a times the difference of h subscript 2 and h subscript 3 minus W-dot subscript u.

The mass flow rate of R134a, m-dot subscript R134a, is equal to W-dot subscript u divided by the difference of h subscript 2 and h subscript 3.

h subscript 2 is equal to h subscript g.

h subscript 3 is equal to h subscript f plus v subscript f times the difference of p minus p subscript sat.

The saturation pressure, p subscript sat, is equal to 8 bar.
