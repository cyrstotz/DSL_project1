The mass flow rate, denoted as m-dot subscript R, equals 1.54 kilograms per second. The temperature T1 is minus 10 degrees Celsius and the temperature T2 is minus 16 degrees Celsius. The entropy s2 equals s3 which is 0.8288 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The enthalpy h2 equals h3 at minus 16 degrees Celsius, which is 237.79 kilojoules per kilogram. The quality of state 3, denoted as x3, is calculated as (s2 minus s_f at 8 bar) divided by (s_g minus s_f at 8 bar), which equals (0.8288 minus 0.3859 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) divided by (6.2066 minus 0.3859 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin), resulting in approximately 1.064, which is not possible.

The mass flow rate m-dot subscript R is also given by the formula m-dot subscript R equals the power dot subscript R divided by (h2 minus h3).
