The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to the product of the sum of m1 and Delta m, and u2, minus the product of m1 and u1. This is equal to Delta m times the enthalpy of fusion at 200 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy of fusion at 200 degrees Celsius is 83.86 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced from Table A-Z.

The internal energy at 70 degrees Celsius, u2, is 292.95 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy at 1000 degrees Celsius, u1, is calculated as xD times the internal energy at 1000 degrees Celsius plus (1 minus xD) times the internal energy at 1000 degrees Celsius, which equals 429.38 kilojoules per kilogram.

The mass m1 is 5755 kilograms.

The expression m1 times u2 minus m1 times u1 is equal to Delta m times the difference between the enthalpy of fusion at 200 degrees Celsius and u2.

The ratio of m1 times the difference between u2 and u1, divided by the difference between the enthalpy of fusion at 200 degrees Celsius and u2, gives Delta m, which is 3756.9 kilograms.
