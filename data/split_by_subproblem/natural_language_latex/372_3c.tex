The temperature of ice, \( T_{eis} \), is 0.003 degrees Celsius, which equals 273.15 Kelvin. The change in energy, \( dE \), is equal to the negative of \( Q_{12} \). The expression \( m_{g2} u_2 - m_{g1} u_1 \) equals negative \( Q_{12} \). Simplifying, \( m_{g} (u_2 - u_1) \) is also equal to negative \( Q_{12} \). Therefore, \( Q_{12} \) equals \( m_{g} (u_1 - u_2) \), which is boxed and equals 1.083 Joules.

In another equation, \( u_1 - u_2 \) equals the product of \( c_{L} \) and \( (T_1 - T_2) \), which is boxed and equals 316.408 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.
