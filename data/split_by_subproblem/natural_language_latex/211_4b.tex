System around compressor:
- The equation zero equals m dot times (h2 minus h3) minus w dot.
- m dot equals w dot divided by (h2 minus h3), where the process is adiabatic.
- h4 equals 38.42 kilojoules per kilogram, which is equal to h1.

Diagram Description: There is a circular diagram with three points labeled 2, 3, and an arrow indicating a transition between these points. The text "adiabat" is written near the diagram.

- h2 when Ti equals 10 degrees Celsius, which is 283.15 Kelvin.
- Tv equals 4 degrees Celsius, which is 277.15 Kelvin.
- Therefore, h2 equals 249.53 kilojoules per kilogram.
