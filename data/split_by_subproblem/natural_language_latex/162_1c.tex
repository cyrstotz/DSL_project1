The rate of entropy generation, denoted as S dot with subscript "evz", equals negative m dot times s minus the rate of heat transfer Q dot divided by temperature T, which simplifies to negative m times the difference between s1 and s2 minus the rate of heat transfer Q dot with subscript R divided by T plus the rate of heat transfer Q dot with subscript "aus" divided by T.

s1g equals 7.7553.

s2g equals 7.3549.

The result equals negative 0.238.
