The description is about a graph with a vertical axis labeled T(K) and a horizontal axis labeled S (kJ/kgK). The graph features a curve that starts at point 0 and passes through points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The characteristics of the curve are as follows:
- The curve is a straight line from point 0 to point 1.
- The curve is a steep upward line from point 1 to point 2.
- The curve is a horizontal line from point 2 to point 3.
- The curve is a steep upward line from point 3 to point 4.
- The curve is a horizontal line from point 4 to point 5.
- The curve is a steep upward line from point 5 to point 6.

The points on the graph are labeled with their temperature characteristics:
- Point 0 is at the origin.
- Point 1 has a higher temperature than point 0.
- Point 2 has a higher temperature than point 1.
- Point 3 has a higher temperature than point 2.
- Point 4 has a higher temperature than point 3.
- Point 5 has a higher temperature than point 4.
- Point 6 has a higher temperature than point 5.

Below the graph, there is a table with columns labeled from 0 to 6. The rows are labeled P and T. The values in the table are as follows:
- For P: 0.191 at point 0, and the same value is repeated from point 1 to point 6.
- For T: -30 at point 0, and no values are provided for points 1 to 6.
