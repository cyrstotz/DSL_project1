Section d) includes a graphical description and a problem statement related to a system.

Graphical Description:
There is a closed loop diagram with four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. State 1 is at the top left, state 2 at the top right, state 3 at the bottom right, and state 4 at the bottom left. The loop is traversed in a clockwise direction. The temperature at state 1 is labeled as "T_zu equals 20 degrees Celsius", and the temperature at state 2 is labeled as "T_zu equals 70 degrees Celsius". The heat transfer from state 1 to state 2 is labeled as "Q_aus,12 equals 37 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilojoules".

Problem: Wood pulp cycle system

The equation provided is:
Delta S equals m_2 times s_2 minus m_1 times s_1 equals Delta m_2 times s_zu plus Q_aus divided by T minus the sum of W_zu divided by T, with m_2 equals m_1.
