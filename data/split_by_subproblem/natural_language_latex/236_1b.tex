b) Stationary flow process with mass flow rate (m dot)

Zero equals m dot times the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance plus the heat transfer rate divided by temperature T plus the generated entropy rate.

The heat transfer rate divided by temperature T equals m dot times the difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit, which implies that temperature T equals the heat transfer rate divided by m dot times the difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit.

Since the cooling jacket is adiabatic, the heat transfer rate Q dot equals the outgoing heat transfer rate Q dot out.

Temperature T equals 62.182 kilojoules per second divided by m dot times the difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit, which is equal to 62.182 kilojoules per second divided by m dot times the difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit.
