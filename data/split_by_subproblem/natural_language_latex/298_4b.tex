- The mass of the cooling, denoted as \( m_{\text{Kühl}} \), is equal to \( m_{\text{K}} \).
- The power \( W_{\text{K}} \) is 28 watts, without damping or is distorted, extended to 85 seconds too long.
- 25 revolutions: full capacitor, \( \beta \) equals 8 seconds.
- Transition from state 1 to state 2 is indicated as "indoc".
- The energy of the cooling, denoted as \( E_{\text{Kühl}} \), is equal to the rate of heat transfer \( \dot{Q}_{\text{Kühl}} \).
- The mass of the cooling, \( m_{\text{Kühl}} \), is equal to the negative of the heat transfer \( Q_{\text{Kühl}} \) divided by the difference \( h_2 - h_1 \).
- The rate of change of energy \( \frac{dE}{dt} \) is equal to the product of the mass of the cooling \( m_{\text{Kühl}} \) and the difference \( h_2 - h_1 \) plus the heat \( Q_{\text{AS}} \).
- \( h_3 \) is the enthalpy at 8 seconds.
- \( h_4 \) is the enthalpy at steady state time \( t \), at 8 seconds.
- The pressure difference \( p_3 - p_1 \) changes again.
