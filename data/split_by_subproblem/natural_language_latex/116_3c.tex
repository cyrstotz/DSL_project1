1. For the gas chamber, closed system:
   - The mass of the gas times the change in internal energy (u2 minus u1) equals the heat added minus the work done, which results in PQ equaling negative 1361.57.
   - The work done, W, equals the initial pressure times the change in volume (V2 minus V1), which equals negative 285.47.
   - V2 is calculated as 0.0039 times the ratio of the gas constant 8.314 to 50 times 10 to the power of negative 3, times 273.15, resulting in approximately 1.1023 times 10 to the power of negative 3.
   - V1 is not provided.
   - u2 is calculated as 273.15 plus 500, resulting in 3.1203 times 10 to the power of negative 3, which is approximately 3.4 liters (noted as 4 liters).
   - The mass of the gas times the change in internal energy (u2 minus u1) equals the specific heat at constant volume times the change in temperature (T2 minus T1), which equals 0.633 times negative 500.
   - This results in negative 316.5 Joules per kilogram.
   - Consequently, the result is approximately negative 1076.17.
