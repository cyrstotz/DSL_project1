The rate of change of internal energy times the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and state 3 equals 28 watts.

From Table A-14:
The enthalpy at state 4, which is the liquid enthalpy at 8 bar, is 263.95 kilojoules per kilogram.

The process is a throttling process and is isenthalpic.

Therefore, the enthalpy at state 4 equals the enthalpy at state 1.

The rate of heat transfer is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference in internal energy between state 2 and state 1 minus the rate of work done by the compressor.

The temperature at state 2 is minus 22 degrees Celsius.

From Table A 14:
The internal energy at state 2, which is the internal energy of the vapor at minus 22 degrees Celsius, is 264.08 kilojoules per kilogram.

From Table A 11:
The enthalpy at state 3, which is the liquid enthalpy at 8 bar, is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

The rate of change of internal energy times the difference between 234.08 kilojoules per kilogram and 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram equals 28 watts.
This results in 140.66 kilojoules per kilogram and a mass flow rate of 0.000199 kilograms per second.

From Table A-11.
