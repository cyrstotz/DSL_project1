The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as T (Temperature) and the y-axis is labeled as P (Pressure). The graph shows a dome-shaped curve representing the phase boundaries. The left side of the dome is labeled as "saturated liquid," and the right side is labeled as "superheated steam." The area under the dome is labeled as "wet steam region." There are three points marked on the graph: point 1 on the right side of the dome, point 2 inside the dome, and point 3 on the left side of the dome. The temperature at the bottom of the graph is marked as negative 2 degrees Celsius.
