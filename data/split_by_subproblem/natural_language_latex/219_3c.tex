Problem c)

1. HS gas:

The change in internal energy minus the heat transfer from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the mass of the substance times the specific heat at constant volume times the change in temperature from T1 to T2 plus the work done by volume change, which is:

Delta U minus Q12 equals m_s times c_v times (T2 minus T1) plus W_v,12

which equals negative 0.80333 kilojoules.

The work done by volume change, W_v,12, is equal to the mass of the substance times the ratio of pressure to density times the change in volume minus the pressure times the change in volume from V1 to V2, which is:

W_v,12 equals m_s times (p_s divided by rho_s) times dV minus p_s times (V2 minus V1)

which equals negative 211.2 kilojoules.

Therefore, the heat transfer Q12 is:

Q12 equals negative 1015.2 kilojoules.

The volume at state 2, V2, is given by:

V2 equals (m_s times R times T2) divided by rho_s

which equals 0.0011031 cubic meters

which is also 1.1032 liters.
