Graph Description:

The graph is a Temperature versus Entropy diagram. The x-axis is labeled as S and the y-axis is labeled as T. The graph consists of six points labeled from 1 to 6, connected by lines to form a closed loop. The points are connected in the following order: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6, and 6 back to 1.

There are several dashed lines running horizontally across the graph, indicating constant pressure lines. These lines are labeled as P0, P3, P4, P5, P1, and P2 from bottom to top. The point 3 is labeled with the coordinates "22-934-558".
