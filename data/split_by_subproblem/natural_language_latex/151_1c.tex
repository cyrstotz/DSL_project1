The total rate of entropy change, denoted as S_tot dot, is equal to the rate of heat input, Q_zu dot, divided by the average temperature of the reservoir, T_R bar, minus the rate of heat output, Q_aus dot, divided by the average temperature of the cooling fluid, T_KF bar. This is calculated as 65 kilowatts divided by 358 Kelvin plus 65 kilowatts divided by 255 Kelvin, which equals negative 0.0387 watts per Kelvin.

The average temperature of the reservoir, T_R bar, is calculated as the average of 100 degrees Celsius and 70 degrees Celsius, which is 85 degrees Celsius, equivalent to 358 Kelvin.

The average temperature of the cooling fluid, T_KF bar, is given as 255 Kelvin.

The rate of heat output, Q_aus dot, is given as 65 kilowatts.
