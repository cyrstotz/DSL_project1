T1 equals negative 26 degrees Celsius and T2 equals negative 22 degrees Celsius. The enthalpy at q1, denoted as h_q1, equals h1. The pressure p1 equals p3, which is 8 bar. The enthalpy at q1, h_q1, equals the enthalpy of fluid at 8 bar, which is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat transfer rate, denoted as Q dot, equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference in enthalpy between q2 and q1, which equals 28 kilojoules.

The enthalpy at state 1, h1, equals the enthalpy of fluid at negative 26 degrees Celsius plus x times the difference between the enthalpy of gas at negative 26 degrees Celsius and the enthalpy of fluid at negative 26 degrees Celsius.

93.42 kilojoules per kilogram equals 16.02 kilojoules per kilogram plus x times the difference between 231.62 kilojoules per kilogram and 16.02 kilojoules per kilogram.

The value of x1 is 0.36.
