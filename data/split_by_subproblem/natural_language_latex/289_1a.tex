The question asks for the value of Q dot out, denoted as:
Q dot out equals question mark.

The energy balance equation is given as:
Zero equals m dot in times (h in minus h out) plus Q dot out plus Q dot R minus the cancelled term V dot T.

Rearranging the terms to solve for Q dot out, we get:
Q dot out equals m dot in times (h out minus h in) minus Q dot R.

The enthalpy at the outlet condition, at 1000 degrees Celsius, is given as:
h out at 1000 degrees Celsius equals h g equals 497.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at the inlet condition, at 70 degrees Celsius, is given as:
h in at 70 degrees Celsius equals h f at 70 degrees equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram, referenced from Table A2.

Finally, the value of Q dot out is calculated as:
Q dot out equals negative 62.182 kilowatts.

This value is negative from the perspective of the reactor.
