The graph description states that the graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as T over k and the x-axis labeled as s over kJ. The graph contains two curves, one starting from point P0 and ending at point P5. There are intermediate points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The curve from P0 to P5 is concave upwards. There is also a straight line connecting points 1, 2, 3, and 4.
