For an ideal gas, T6 equals T5 times the ratio of p6 over p5 raised to the power of (n-1) over n.

T6 equals 328.075 Kelvin.

Discussion:

The sum of he plus half of omega2 squared equals ha plus half of omega2 squared.

The sum of h5 plus half of omega2 squared equals h6 plus half of omega6 squared.

Omega6 equals the square root of two times (h5 minus h6) plus omega3 squared.

Omega6 equals 507.94 meters per second.

The difference h5 minus h6 equals the integral from T5 to T6 of cp dT.

The difference h5 minus h6 equals cp times (T5 minus T6) which equals 104647.95 Joules per kilogram.
