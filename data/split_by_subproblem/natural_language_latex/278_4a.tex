The first graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( p \) in bars and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T \) in Kelvin. The graph displays a wavy line that begins at a high value on the vertical axis and oscillates downwards and upwards several times as it progresses to the right along the horizontal axis.

The second graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( p \) in bars and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T \) in Kelvin. The graph includes the following elements:
- A curve starting from the origin and rising upwards, labeled "isotherm".
- A horizontal arrow pointing to the right from the curve, labeled "solid".
- A vertical arrow pointing upwards from the horizontal arrow, labeled "gas".
- A horizontal arrow pointing to the right from the vertical arrow, labeled "liquid".
- A vertical arrow pointing downwards from the horizontal arrow, labeled "isobar".
