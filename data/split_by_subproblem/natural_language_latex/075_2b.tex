Omega naught, T naught gas. Omega naught equals 220 meters per second. P five equals 0.5 bar. T five equals 431.9 Kelvin. P six equals 0.141 bar.

The equation m dot squared times (h five minus h six) plus one half omega five squared minus one half omega six squared equals zero.

The equation C p times (T five minus T six) plus one half omega five squared minus one half omega six squared equals zero.

n equals 1.4.

Polynomial, T six equals T five times (p six over p five) raised to the power of (n minus one over n), equals 328.07 Kelvin.

The boxed section contains the following calculations:
One half omega six squared equals 1.006 times Delta T plus one half omega five squared equals 24.304 plus 5 equals 77.95. Omega six equals 220.7 meters per second.
