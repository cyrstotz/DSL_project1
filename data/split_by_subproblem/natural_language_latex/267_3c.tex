Energy balance for gas (closed, isobaric):

The change in internal energy is given by the mass of the gas times the difference in specific internal energy between state 2 and state 1, which equals the heat transferred minus the work done:
Delta U equals m_g times (u_2 minus u_1) equals Q_12 minus W_12.

The heat transferred Q_12 is calculated as the mass of the gas times the specific heat at constant volume times the temperature difference plus the mass of the gas times the integral from T_1 to T_2 of the initial gas pressure times the differential volume:
Q_12 equals m_g times c_v times (T_2 minus T_1) plus m_g times the integral from T_1 to T_2 of p_g1 dv.
This simplifies to m_g times c_v times (T_2 minus T_1) equals p_g1 times (V_g2 minus (m_g times average R times T_1 divided by p_g2)).

The volume V_g2 is given by the mass of the gas times the average gas constant times the temperature at state 2 divided by the pressure at state 2, which approximately equals 0.777 liters.

Thus, the heat transferred Q_12 equals negative 7.507 kilojoules.
