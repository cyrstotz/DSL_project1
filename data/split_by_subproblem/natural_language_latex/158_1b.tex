The mean temperature \( T_{\text{m}} \) is given by the formula:

\[
T_{\text{m}} = \frac{\int_{s_a}^{s_e} T \, ds}{s_e - s_a}
\]

where \( s_e \) is 288.15 Kelvin and \( s_a \) is 258.15 Kelvin.

The mean temperature \( T_{\text{m}} \) is also calculated as:

\[
T_{\text{m}} = \frac{2.8545 \, \text{kJ/kg} \cdot \text{K}}{1.3 \, \text{kJ/kg} \cdot \text{K}}
\]

Again, \( s_e \) is 288.15 Kelvin and \( s_a \) is 258.15 Kelvin.
