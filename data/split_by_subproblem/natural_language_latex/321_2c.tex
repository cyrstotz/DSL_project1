The change in exergy due to the stream, denoted as Delta e_x,str, is calculated as follows:
- It is equal to the difference in enthalpy (h_aus minus h_ein) minus the product of the reference temperature (T_0) and the difference in entropy (s_aus minus s_ein), plus half the difference of the squares of the outlet and inlet velocities (v_aus squared minus v_ein squared divided by 2).

Breaking down the components:
- The difference in enthalpy (h_aus minus h_ein) is equal to h_2 minus h_0, which is calculated using the specific heat capacity at 15 degrees Celsius (c_p^15) times the difference in temperatures (T_2 minus T_0). This results in 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (328.16 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin), which equals 85.4597 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The term T_0 times (s_aus minus s_ein) approximates to T_0 times (s_2 minus s_0), which is T_0 times the difference in specific heats at constant pressure for 15 degrees Celsius times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_2 to T_0 minus the gas constant R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p_0 to p_0 (since p_0 equals p_2, this term cancels out). This calculation gives 243.15 Kelvin times 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the natural logarithm of (328.1 divided by 243.15), resulting in 73.2946 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The kinetic energy term, half the difference of the squares of the velocities (v_aus squared minus v_ein squared divided by 2), is calculated as half of (507.1 meters squared per second squared minus 200 meters squared per second squared), which equals 108.621 kilojoules per kilogram.

Summing these components, the change in exergy due to the stream, Delta e_x,str, is 85.4597 kilojoules per kilogram minus 73.2946 kilojoules per kilogram plus 108.621 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in 120.786 kilojoules per kilogram.
