The graph is a phase diagram with the y-axis labeled as rho and the x-axis labeled as T. There are three distinct regions labeled as "Gaseous", "Solid", and "Liquid". The "Gaseous" region is in the upper right, the "Solid" region is in the lower left, and the "Liquid" region is in between. The "Triple point" is marked at the intersection of the three regions.
