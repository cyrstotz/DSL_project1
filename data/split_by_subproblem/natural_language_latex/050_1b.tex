The average temperature T_KL is equal to T_1d divided by the difference between s_a and s_e, which is equal to the difference between h_a and h_e divided by the difference between s_a and s_e, which is equal to e raised to the power of the fraction (T_a minus T_e) divided by e, all over the natural logarithm of the fraction T_a over T_e, which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
