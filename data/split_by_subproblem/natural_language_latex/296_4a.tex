The verbal description of the graph is as follows: The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled T for Temperature and the y-axis is labeled P for Pressure. There is a curve that begins at the origin and curves upwards to the right, which is labeled "Isotherm". On this curve, there are two marked points labeled 1 and 2. Point 1 is positioned higher on the curve compared to point 2. From point 1, a horizontal line extends to the right, labeled "Higher". Additionally, a vertical line extends downwards from point 1, labeled "Triple". The intersection of this vertical line with the curve is labeled as point 2.
