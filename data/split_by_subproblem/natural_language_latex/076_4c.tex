The density rho subscript n equals rho subscript 2.

The enthalpy h subscript n equals h subscript 4 equals h subscript f at pressure equals 8 bar, which is 93.62 kilojoules per kilogram, the temperature T equals 40, and A equals 7 times n.

The quality x subscript n equals the fraction where the numerator is h subscript n minus h subscript f at pressure subscript 2, and the denominator is h subscript g at pressure subscript 2 minus h subscript f at pressure subscript 2.
