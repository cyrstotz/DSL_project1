- The graph is a plot of T in Kelvin on the y-axis versus s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the x-axis.
- There are several curves labeled as "Isobar (ideal gas)".
- The curves are labeled from 1 to 6, with points marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The points are connected by lines indicating different processes:
    - From point 1 to 2: Isothermal
    - From point 2 to 3: Isobaric
    - From point 3 to 4: Isothermal
    - From point 4 to 5: Isobaric
    - From point 5 to 6: Isothermal
- Additional annotations include:
    - "Isothermal" is written next to the horizontal lines.
    - "Isobaric" is written next to the vertical lines.
    - "Adiabatic reversible" and "Adiabatic irreversible" are written next to the slanted lines.
