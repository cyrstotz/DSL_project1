The graph description is as follows: The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as S in units of kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin, and the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin. There are three curves labeled as "isotherm" and "isentrope". The first curve starts from point 1, goes through point 2, and ends at point 3. The second curve starts from point 4 and ends at point 3. The third curve starts from point 0 and ends at point 4. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked on the graph.
