The extended entropy change is equal to T_0 times the derivative of s_erz.

Entropy:

The equation is zero equals s_0 minus s_6 plus q over T plus the derivative of s_erz.

The derivative of s_erz equals s_6 minus s_0, which is s^0 at T_6 minus s^0 at T_0 minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p_6 over p_0.

The ratio of p_6 over p_0 equals zero.

s^0 at T_6 (from part b) equals 1.7337 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

s^0 at T_0 equals 1.4911.

T_0 equals 273.15 minus 30, which is 243.15 Kelvin.

Interpolating in A-22:

s at T_0 equals (1.59117 minus 1.47824) divided by (250 minus 240) times (243.15 minus 240) plus 1.47824, which results in 1.4911 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

s_ex equals 1.7931 minus 1.4911, which is 0.30186 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The volumetric extended energy, e_x, vol, equals T_0 times s_ex, which is 73.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
