b) Given W6 T6:
- The entropy at state 5 equals the entropy at state 6, denoted as s_5 equals s_6.
- The pressure at state 6 is 0.191 bar.
- The ratio of temperature at state 6 to temperature at state 5 is equal to the ratio of pressure at state 6 to pressure at state 5 raised to the power of (n-1)/n. This leads to the equation T_6 equals (p_6 divided by p_5) raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 times T_5, which equals 320.07 Kelvin.
- The volume flow rate at state 5 is 220 cubic meters per second times seconds to the power of negative one times A.
