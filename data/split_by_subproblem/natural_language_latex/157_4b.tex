The initial temperature \( T_i \) is negative 10 degrees Celsius. The evaporation temperature \( T_{\text{Verdampf}} \) is calculated as \( T_i \) minus 6 degrees Celsius, which equals negative 16 degrees Celsius. The saturation pressure \( p_s \) is 8 bar, which equals the ambient pressure \( p_a \). The quality at state 2, \( x_2 \), is 1, and at state 4, \( x_4 \), is 0. The output \( O \) is given by the mass flow rate of R134a, \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \), times the difference in enthalpy between state 3 and state 4, plus the heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{de}} \). The output \( O \) is also given by the mass flow rate of R134a times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3, minus the work \( \dot{W}_k \). The mass flow rate of R134a, \( \dot{m}_{\text{R134a}} \), is calculated as the work \( \dot{W}_k \) divided by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3. The enthalpy at state 3, \( h_3 \), at 8 bar is 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram. The enthalpy at state 2, \( h_2 \), at negative 16 degrees Celsius is 237.74 kilojoules per kilogram. The mass flow rate of R134a is 3.8167 kilograms per hour.
