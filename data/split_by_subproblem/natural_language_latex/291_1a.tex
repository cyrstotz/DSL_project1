The heat input rate equals the sum of the heat output rate and the heat loss rate.

Zero equals the product of the mass flow rate entering and the difference between the enthalpy entering and the enthalpy exiting, plus the heat output rate minus the heat loss rate.

The heat output rate equals the heat loss rate plus the product of the mass flow rate entering and the difference between the enthalpy exiting and the enthalpy entering.

The mass flow rate entering equals the mass flow rate exiting.

Zero equals the heat loss rate.

The heat input rate changes to the heat output rate under isobaric conditions.

Zero equals the product of the mass flow rate entering and the difference between the enthalpy entering and the enthalpy exiting, plus the heat output rate plus the heat loss rate.

The heat output rate equals the heat loss rate plus the product of the mass flow rate entering and the difference between the enthalpy exiting and the enthalpy entering.

The enthalpy exiting is 419.06 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy entering is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat output rate is 62.182 kilojoules per second.
