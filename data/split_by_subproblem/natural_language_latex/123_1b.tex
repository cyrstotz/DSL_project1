The integral from s_a to s_e of T ds equals q_rev, which is equal to h_a minus h_e.

T_m_KF equals the integral from s_a to s_e of T ds divided by s_a minus s_e, which equals h_a minus h_e divided by s_a minus s_e.

T_m_KF equals T_2 minus T_1 divided by the natural logarithm of T_2 over T_1, where the natural logarithm applies.

T_m_KF equals 248.15 minus 288.15 divided by the natural logarithm of T_2 over T_1, which equals the natural logarithm of 298.15 over 288.15.

T_m_KF equals 10 divided by the natural logarithm of 298.15 over 288.15, which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
