The rate of external entropy change, denoted as S dot subscript ex, equals the heat flow rate Q dot subscript RF divided by the temperature T subscript RF, which equals 225 Kelvin, and this is only within the reaction wall.

Graphical Description:
There is a vertical rectangle labeled "Cooling Wall" on the left and "Reaction Wall" on the right. The rectangle is divided into two sections by a vertical dashed line labeled "System Boundary" in red. The left section is labeled "Right < 0" and the right section is labeled "Left > 0".

The rate of external entropy change, denoted as S dot subscript ex, equals the heat flow rate Q dot subscript aus divided by the temperature T subscript RF, which equals the negative of negative 67.28 kilojoules divided by 295 Kelvin, resulting in 0.2112 kilojoules per second per Kelvin.
