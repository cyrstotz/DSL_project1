a) Required: Heat flow rate out, denoted as Q-dot-out.

1. First Law of Thermodynamics for flow processes around a reaction mixture:

The equation is:
mass flow rate times (enthalpy in minus enthalpy out) plus heat flow rate due to reaction minus heat flow rate out equals zero.

Rearranging the equation gives:
Heat flow rate out equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy in minus enthalpy out) plus heat flow rate due to reaction.

Where:
enthalpy in equals 292.58 kilojoules per kilogram, according to Table A-2.

enthalpy out equals 415.04 kilojoules per kilogram, according to Table A-2.

Therefore, substituting the values we get:
Heat flow rate out equals heat flow rate due to reaction, which is 62.182 kilojoules per second.
