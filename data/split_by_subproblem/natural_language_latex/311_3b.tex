The pressure remains constant, \( P_{AG} = P_{EG} = 1.4 \) bar.

The mass \( m_G \) also remains constant.

The temperature \( T_{EG} \) must be equal to \( T_W = 0^\circ C \).

Left Hand Side in both equations:

\[ m_1 (\dot{u}_{2w} - \dot{u}_{1w}) + m_2 (\dot{u}_{2g} - \dot{u}_{1g}) = 0 \]

\[ m_w + \dot{m} = 0 \Rightarrow \dot{m} = m_w \]
