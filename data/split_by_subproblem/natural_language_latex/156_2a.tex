Graph 1: The graph is a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram. The x-axis is labeled V and the y-axis is labeled p. There are several curves and lines:
- A straight line labeled 2 starting from the origin and extending diagonally upwards to the right.
- A curve labeled P0 starting from the bottom left and curving upwards to the right.
- Another curve labeled P2 above P0.
- A point labeled 1 on the P0 curve.
- A point labeled 2 on the P2 curve.
- A vertical dashed line connecting points 1 and 2.
- A point labeled 3 on the P2 curve, above point 2.
- A point labeled 4 on the P2 curve, above point 3.
- A point labeled 5 on the P2 curve, above point 4.
- A horizontal dashed line connecting points 3, 4, and 5.
- The word "isobar" written near the top right of the graph.

Graph 2: The graph is a Temperature-Volume (T-V) diagram. The x-axis is labeled V and the y-axis is labeled T. There are several curves and lines:
- A curve labeled P0 starting from the bottom left and curving upwards to the right.
- Another curve labeled P2 above P0.
- A curve labeled P5 above P2.
- A point labeled 1 on the P0 curve.
- A point labeled 2 on the P2 curve.
- A point labeled 3 on the P2 curve, above point 2.
- A point labeled 4 on the P2 curve, above point 3.
- A point labeled 5 on the P5 curve, above point 4.
- A vertical dashed line connecting points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- A point labeled 6 on the P0 curve, below point 1.
- A horizontal dashed line connecting points 1 and 6.
