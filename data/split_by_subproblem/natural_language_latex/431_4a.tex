The first graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as p(T) and the x-axis labeled as T(K). The graph displays a curve that begins at the bottom left, ascends to a peak, and then descends. The areas under the curve are labeled as follows:
- The region to the left of the peak is labeled "Undercooled Liquid".
- The region under the peak is labeled "Mass\_steam".
- The region to the right of the peak is labeled "Supersaturated Steam".
