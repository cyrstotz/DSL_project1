The change in energy from state 1 to state 2, denoted as Delta E_12, equals the change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2, denoted as Delta U_12, which is equal to the mass of gas times the specific heat at constant volume times the temperature difference from T_2,g to T_g1. This is equal to the heat added Q_12 minus the work done W_v. The work done W_v equals the pressure of the gas times the change in volume from V_2,g to V_g1, which calculates to 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals times (1.105 minus 3.14) times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters, resulting in negative 284.34 Joules. Furthermore, work is done on a frictionless cylinder. The volume V_2,g equals the mass of gas times the gas constant R times the temperature T_2 divided by the pressure p_g, which calculates to 3.143 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms times 166.28 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times 273.15 Kelvin divided by 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals, resulting in 1.105 liters.

The heat Q_12 equals the mass of gas times the specific heat at constant volume times the temperature difference from T_g2 to T_g1 plus the work done W_v. This calculates to 3.143 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms times 0.633 times 10 to the power of 3 Joules per kilogram Kelvin times negative 500 Kelvin minus 284.34 Joules, resulting in negative 1366.5 Joules.
