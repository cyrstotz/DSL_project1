Item b)

Description:
- Diagram: A pie chart with an arrow passing from left to right through the circle, labeled with the numbers 2 and 3. Another arrow points upwards out of the circle and is labeled with \( \dot{W}_K \).

Equations:
- Zero equals \( \dot{m} \) times \( h_2 \) minus \( h_3 \) minus \( \dot{W}_K \).
- \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) at 8 bar equals.
- \( s_2 \) equals \( s_3 \).
- \( s_3 \), \( s_3 \) superheated, \( s_3 \) at 8 bar equals Table 12.
