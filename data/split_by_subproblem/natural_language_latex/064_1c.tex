The equations and expressions provided are as follows:

1. The output entropy \( s_{\text{out}} \) is equal to the mass flow rate of the second stream \( m_2 \) times the entropy of the second stream \( s_2 \) minus the mass flow rate of the first stream \( m_1 \) times the entropy of the first stream \( s_1 \) minus the heat transfer rate \( Q_{\text{J}} \) divided by the temperature \( T_{\text{J}} \).

2. The mass flow rates \( m_2 \) and \( m_1 \) are both equal to \( m_{\text{ein}} \) times 0.3 kilograms per second.

3. The temperature \( T \) is 293 Kelvin.

4. The heat transfer rate \( Q_{\text{J}} \) is 65 kilowatts.

5. The entropy \( s_1 \) for the first stream is 0.05149 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, noted as from turbine A-2.

6. The entropy \( s_2 \) for the second stream is 1.30069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

7. The output entropy \( s_{\text{out}} \) calculation is canceled out in the document, and the final value is given as -2028.42 kilojoules per Kelvin.

In the solution section:

1. The change in entropy \( \Delta S_{12} \) is given by the mass flow rate of the second stream \( m_2 \) times its entropy \( S_2 \) minus the mass flow rate of the first stream \( m_1 \) times its entropy \( S_1 \).

2. The mass \( m_1 \) is 5755 kilograms, and the mass \( m_2 \) is the change in mass \( \Delta m \) times \( m_1 \), which equals 9355 kilograms.

3. The change in entropy \( \Delta S \) is calculated as 9355 times 1.3069 minus 0.1956 times 5755, resulting in 6733.97.
