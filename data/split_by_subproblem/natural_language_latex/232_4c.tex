A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as p in bar. The graph displays a rectangular cycle with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is located at the bottom left, point 2 is at the bottom right, point 3 is at the top right, and point 4 is at the top left. The cycle forms a rectangle with horizontal and vertical lines connecting the points.
