- A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as P in bar.
- The graph consists of a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is at the top left, point 3 is at the top right, and point 4 is at the bottom right.
- Arrows indicate the direction of the cycle, moving from point 1 to point 2, from point 2 to point 3, from point 3 to point 4, and from point 4 back to point 1.
- The curve from point 1 to point 2 and from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "isotherm".
- The curve from point 2 to point 3 and from point 4 to point 1 is labeled "adiabatic".
- The top part of the graph is labeled "given steam".
- The bottom part of the graph is labeled "wet steam region".
