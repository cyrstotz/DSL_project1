The rate of entropy production due to ozone, denoted as S dot subscript oz, equals the heat transfer rate out, denoted as Q dot subscript aus, multiplied by the difference between the reciprocal of the temperature at the cooling fluid, denoted as T subscript KF, and the reciprocal of the temperature at the reactor, denoted as T subscript reaktor.

This equals approximately 0.0461 kilojoules per second per Kelvin.
