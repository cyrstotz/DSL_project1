Subsection c) m_R with energy balance around

A table is presented with four rows and three columns. The columns are separated by vertical lines and each cell is centered. The first row acts as a header with the symbols '+' and 'p'. The subsequent rows contain the following entries:
- Row 1: 'NO' under the '+' column.
- Row 2: 'vap sat.' under the '+' column and 'Balance A10 with' under the 'p' column, followed by 'P_2 = P_1'.
- Row 3: 'VSUPER.' under the '+' column and 'TAB MS at 8 bar' under the 'p' column, followed by the number 8.
- Row 4: 'lig sat' under the '+' column, followed by the numbers 31.33 and 8 under the 'p' column.

The equations are as follows:
- The dot product of W_e with 576.
- The equation zero equals m dot times (h_2 minus h_5) plus m dot times the fraction of (w_5 squared minus w_2 squared) over 2.
- The equation two times (h_2 minus h_5) equals w_5 squared minus w_2 squared implies w_5 squared equals w_2 squared minus two times (h_2 minus h_5).
- The equation (h_2 minus h_5) equals c_p times (T_5 minus T_2) equals 1.006 times (311.4 minus 293.9) equals negative 118.25.
- The equation for w_5 equals the square root of (220 squared minus 2 times 118.25) equals 220.26 meters per second.
