Closed system in gas:

The change in energy from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the heat added minus the work done, expressed as:
E2 minus E1 equals Q minus W.

The change in internal energy, considering mass and specific internal energy changes, is given by:
m times (u2 minus u1) equals Q12.

Using the specific heat at constant volume, the equation becomes:
m times cv times (T2 minus T1) equals Q12.

The heat transfer Q12 is calculated as:
Q12 equals 3.475 times 10 to the power of 5 Joules per kilogram times 0.673 kilograms per Kelvin times ((273.15 Kelvin minus 7.73 Kelvin) minus 1082.77).

The final value of Q12 is boxed and given as:
Q12 equals negative 1082.77.
