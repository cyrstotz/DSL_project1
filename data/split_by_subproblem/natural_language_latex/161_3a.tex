The graph description includes a plot with the y-axis labeled as p(bar) and the x-axis labeled as T(degrees Celsius). There are two curves on the graph: one is labeled "liquid" and the other is labeled "vapor". The point where these two curves intersect is marked with a point labeled i. A vertical line extends from point i down to the x-axis and is labeled T(Krit). Another point on the "vapor" curve is labeled ii. The region below the curves is labeled "liquid" and the region above the curves is labeled "vapor".
