Zero equals m dot times the difference of h two and h three plus Q dot. 
m dot times the difference of h three and h two equals Q dot. 
m dot equals Q dot divided by the difference of h three and h two, at 8 bar. 
Zero equals m dot times the difference of h four and h two plus Q sub K dot. 
S two equals S three, which is boxed. 
h three equals h f plus the fraction of S two minus S f over S g minus S f times the difference of h fg minus h f. 
h two equals h of GK1, interpolation from table A-12.
