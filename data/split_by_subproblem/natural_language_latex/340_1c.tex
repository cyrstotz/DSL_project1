The total change in internal energy, denoted as U-dot-total, is equal to the mass flow rate, m-dot, times the difference in specific internal energy between state 2 and state 1, plus the heat added per unit temperature, Q-dot-zu over T, plus the total work rate, W-dot-total. This is mathematically represented as:

U-dot-total equals m-dot times (e2 minus e1) plus Q-dot-zu over T plus W-dot-total.

Substituting the values, it becomes:

m-dot times (7.86 kilojoules per kilogram-Kelvin minus 0.55 kilojoules per kilogram-Kelvin) plus 62.12 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 295 Kelvin.

This simplifies to:

Negative 0.37 kilowatts per kilogram.
