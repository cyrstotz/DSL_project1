The change in entropy, Delta S, is equal to m2 times s2 minus m1 times s1.

m2 is equal to m1 plus Delta m12, which equals 9255 kilograms.

m1 equals 5755 kilograms.

s1 is the entropy at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

s2 is the entropy at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Therefore, the change in entropy, Delta S, equals 1376.39 kilojoules per Kelvin.
