Zero equals the change in exergy due to structure plus the sum of one minus the ratio of critical temperature to initial temperature times mass flow rate times the difference between the exergy input per mass flow rate and the exergy output per mass flow rate minus the input work rate minus the exergy rate due to volume.

Negative exergy due to volume equals the change in exergy due to structure minus the input work rate.

Exergy due to volume equals initial temperature times the rate of exergy entropy, which equals initial temperature times the difference between entropy at state e2 and entropy at state a, equals initial temperature times the difference between entropy at state a and entropy at state e, equals initial temperature times the difference between entropy at state e2 and entropy at state a, equals initial temperature times the quantity specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature at state e to initial temperature minus the gas constant times the natural logarithm of the ratio of initial pressure to critical pressure, equals 15,471.75 Joules per kilogram, equals 15.622 kilojoules per kilogram.
