- The mass flow rate, m dot, equals the heat transfer rate, Q dot subscript u, divided by the change in enthalpy, Delta h subscript u/s.
- The temperature T2 is negative 22 degrees Celsius.
- X1 of the refrigerant.
- X1 equals the difference between S1u and Sf1 divided by the difference between Sg1 and Sf1.
- S1u equals S4, since the throttle is adiabatic-isentropic.
- Sf1 equals Sf at T2, which is 0.3463 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
- Sf equals Sf at T2 equals negative 22 degrees Celsius.
- S4 equals S1, which is the same as in line 2, since the compression from 1 to 2.
