- The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as p in bar and the x-axis labeled as T in Kelvin.
- The curve starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls back down to the bottom right.
- There are four points marked on the curve:
  - Point 1 is at the bottom left.
  - Point 2 is at the bottom right.
  - Point 3 is at the top right.
  - Point 4 is at the top left.
- Arrows indicate a cycle moving from point 1 to point 4, then to point 3, then to point 2, and back to point 1.
