- The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram.
- The x-axis is labeled s in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
- The y-axis is labeled T in degrees Celsius.
- There are two isobaric lines labeled p0 and p5 equals 0.5 bar.
- The graph contains six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The points are connected by lines indicating the process path.
- The path starts at point 0, moves to point 1, then to point 2, then to point 3, then to point 4, then to point 5, and finally to point 6.
