The question asks for the value of Q dot out.

Q_R is equal to 100 kilowatts.

The total mass, m_ges,1, is 5.255 kilograms.

The mass flow rate, m dot, is 0.3 kilograms per second.

x_0 is equal to 0.005.

Energy balance (Balcony):

The equation is zero equals m dot times (h_e minus h_a) plus Q dot R plus or minus Q dot out, which simplifies to:

h_e equals h_f at 30 degrees Celsius plus x_0 times (h_fg at 30 degrees Celsius minus h_f at 30 degrees Celsius).

h_e equals 304.648 kilojoules per kilogram.

h_a equals h_f at 100 degrees Celsius plus x_0 times (h_fg at 100 degrees Celsius minus h_f at 100 degrees Celsius).

h_a equals 430.33 kilojoules per kilogram.

Q dot out equals m dot times (h_e minus h_a) plus 100 kilowatts.

Q dot out equals 62.3 kilowatts.
