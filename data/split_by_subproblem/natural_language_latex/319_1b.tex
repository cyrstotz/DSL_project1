The average temperature T-bar with subscript KF equals the integral from s-sub-a to s-sub-e of T ds divided by s-sub-a minus s-sub-e equals q with subscript REV divided by s-sub-a minus s-sub-e equals the sum of h with subscript KF,ein and h with subscript KF,aus divided by s-sub-a minus s-sub-e.

From the material model,

equals s-sub-d times the difference T-sub-2 minus T-sub-1 plus v-sub-d times the difference p-sub-2 minus p-sub-1 all over c-sub-p,d times the natural logarithm of T-sub-2 over T-sub-1, since it is isobaric.

T-sub-2 equals T with subscript KF,aus, and T-sub-1 equals T with subscript KF,ein.

The average temperature T-bar with subscript KF equals the difference T-sub-2 minus T-sub-1 divided by the natural logarithm of T-sub-2 over T-sub-1 equals 293.122 Kelvin.
