The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum over i of the mass flow rate of i times the sum of the enthalpy of i at time t, half the square of the velocity of i at time t, and the product of pressure and volume of i at time t, minus the sum over j of the mass flow rate of j times the sum of the enthalpy of j at time t, half the square of the velocity of j at time t, and the product of pressure and volume of j at time t, plus the sum over j of the heat transfer rate minus the sum over n of the work rate.

Zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance plus the mass force minus the heat transfer rate out.

The heat transfer rate out equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance minus the mass force.

The enthalpy at exit is the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 292.88 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at entrance is the enthalpy at 0 degrees Celsius, which is 41.5 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat transfer rate out is 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 292.88 kilojoules per kilogram and 41.5 kilojoules per kilogram plus 100 kilowatts.

The heat transfer rate out is 62.182 kilowatts.
