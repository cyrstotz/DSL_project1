The mass flow rate of R, denoted as m-dot subscript R, equals the ratio of the work rate, denoted as W-dot subscript k, to the reversible work per unit mass from state 2 to 3, denoted as w subscript 23 superscript rev.

The reversible work per unit mass from state 2 to 3, denoted as w subscript 23 superscript rev, equals the negative integral of pressure p with respect to volume v, evaluated from volume v subscript A to volume v subscript 2.
