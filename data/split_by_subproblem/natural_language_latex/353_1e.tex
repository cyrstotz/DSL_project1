Entropy Balance Half-Open System

The change in entropy, Delta S, is equal to the sum of the mass flow rate GEST and the change in mass flow rate from state 1 to state 2, multiplied by sigma 2, minus the mass flow rate GEST multiplied by sigma 1. This is approximately 1387.9 kilojoules per Kelvin.

Sigma 1 is equal to the entropy of the fluid at 100 degrees Celsius plus the dryness fraction xp times the difference between the entropy of the gas at 100 degrees Celsius and the entropy of the fluid at 100 degrees Celsius. This is approximately 1.3371 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Sigma 2 is equal to the entropy of the fluid at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Graphical Description
There is a simple diagram showing a horizontal pipe with an arrow pointing upwards labeled as the heat flow out, and another arrow pointing downwards also labeled as the heat flow out.
