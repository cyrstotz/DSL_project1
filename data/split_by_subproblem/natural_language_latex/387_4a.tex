The graph consists of a horizontal axis labeled T(K) and a vertical axis labeled p(N/m^2). There are three curves on the graph:
- The first curve starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls back down.
- The second curve starts at the same point as the first curve, rises to a higher peak, falls below the horizontal axis, rises again to a smaller peak, and then falls back down.
- The third curve starts at the same point as the first two curves, rises to a peak, falls below the horizontal axis, rises again to a smaller peak, and then falls back down, similar to the second curve but with different amplitudes.

He would cool down to the condensation temperature of R134a, about up to -22 degrees Celsius, and then no more heat would be released because an equilibrium is reached.

The graph is a plot with the horizontal axis labeled T(u) and the vertical axis labeled p/N_1/2. The plot shows a curve that starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls back down, forming a bell-shaped curve.
- The curve starts at the origin and rises steeply.
- There is a point labeled i at the peak of the curve.
- To the left of the peak, there is a point labeled i'.
- To the right of the peak, there is another point labeled i''.
- The curve then descends symmetrically after the peak.
