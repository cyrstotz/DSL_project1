The average temperature T-bar is equal to the integral of T dt divided by e.

The difference between s2 and s1 is equal to the integral of Q-dot over T, which equals 733.792 kilojoules per kilogram minus 7.72 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in negative 6.354 kilojoules per kilogram.

This is equal to beta times T minus the product of s2 and s1.

The difference between s2 and s1 is equal to the integral of e raised to the power of a over T divided by T dt, which equals e raised to the power of a over T times the natural logarithm of T2 over T1.
