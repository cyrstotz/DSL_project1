Energy balance:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, minus the heat flow rate out plus the heat flow rate R.

The heat flow rate out equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat flow rate R.

The enthalpy at the inlet at 70 degrees Celsius and quality x equals zero is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at the outlet at 100 degrees Celsius and quality x equals zero is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, the heat flow rate out equals 0.3 times (292.98 minus 419.04) plus 700.

This equals 62.18 kilowatts.
