Energy balance for compressor:
The equation is zero equals mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entry, plus the sum of heat input minus the sum of work input.

Since it is adiabatic, the heat input equals zero.

The total work equals 28 watts and is equal to the compressor work.

The enthalpy at exit equals h2.

The enthalpy at entry equals h3, which is 2.6 times 4.15 kilojoules per kilogram, reference A-11.

The pressure at point 2 equals the pressure at point 1.

Adiabatic throttling equals isenthalpic.

The mass flow rate equals the total work input divided by the difference between enthalpy at entry and enthalpy at exit, which equals 28 watts divided by the difference between h3 and h2.
