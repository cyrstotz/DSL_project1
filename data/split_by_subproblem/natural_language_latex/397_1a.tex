a) From the energy balance

The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum over i of the mass flow rate of i times the quantity of enthalpy of i plus half the velocity of i squared plus g times the height of i, plus the sum over j of the heat flow rate of j, plus the sum over k of the work flow rate of k.

The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy from inlet to outlet plus the heat flow rate in plus the heat flow rate around equals zero.

The heat flow rate around equals negative of the sum of the heat flow rate in plus the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy from outlet to inlet.

From the TAB A-3

The enthalpy at the inlet is 1267 kilojoules per kilogram, which is the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy at the outlet is the enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 1407.6 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat flow rate around equals negative of negative 100 kilowatts plus 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference in enthalpy from 1267 kilojoules per kilogram to 1407.6 kilojoules per kilogram.

This equals 57.82 kilowatts.
