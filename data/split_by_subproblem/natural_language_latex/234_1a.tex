Energy balance of a steady flow process:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat input rate minus the heat output rate minus the technical work rate.
The heat output rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat input rate.
The enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.
From Table A-2, the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

Graphical Description:
There is a wavy line graph with peaks and troughs, representing some form of oscillation or periodic function. The x-axis is labeled with enthalpy and the y-axis is labeled with values around 419.04 and 292.98.

The heat output rate is 2.182 kilowatts.
