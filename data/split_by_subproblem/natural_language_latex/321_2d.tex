Exergy balance, stationary, mass-specific:
The equation is zero equals the rate of exergy flow plus the difference in enthalpy between the inlet and the outlet minus the product of the reference temperature and the difference in entropy between the inlet and the outlet plus the change in exergy plus the product of one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the burner temperature and the burner heat flow minus the product of one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the burner temperature and the work flow rate minus the exergy loss. This equals the negative change in the rate of exergy flow.

The exergy loss equals the negative change in the rate of exergy flow plus the product of one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the burner temperature and the ratio of the burner heat flow to the mass flow rate. This is calculated as negative 120.786 kilojoules per kilogram plus the product of one minus the ratio of 263.15 Kelvin to 1289 Kelvin and 1.745 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 898.796 kilojoules per kilogram.
