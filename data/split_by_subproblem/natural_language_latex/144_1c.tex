Entropy balance:
The derivative of the entropy rate with respect to time equals the sum of the heat transfer rates divided by their respective temperatures plus the generated entropy rate.

This implies that the generated entropy rate equals the heat transfer rate out divided by the cold temperature, which equals 62.182 kilojoules divided by 293.12 Kelvin, resulting in 0.212 kilojoules per Kelvin.
