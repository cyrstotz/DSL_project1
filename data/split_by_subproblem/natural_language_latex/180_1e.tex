The change in entropy, denoted as Delta S, is equal to the sum of the heat transfer divided by the temperature, which simplifies to the difference between the product of mass and entropy at state 2 and state 1, expressed as:

Delta S equals the sum of (Delta Q over T) equals the sum of (m2 times s2 minus m1 times s1).

Further simplifying, Delta S equals m2 times s2 minus m1 times s1, which equals S.

The mass at state 2, m2, is 9355 with a change in mass, Delta m, of 3600.

The entropy at state 1, s1, is calculated using the formula s1 equals s_f plus x times (s_g minus s_f), which equals 1.337.

The entropy at state 2, s2, is 9.9548.

Thus, the change in entropy, Delta S, results in 1238.6 kilograms.
