The specific kinetic energy, E_k, is equal to the heat input rate, dot Q_zu, divided by the mass flow rate, dot m, which calculates to 578 divided by 28, resulting in 20.64.

The heat input rate, dot Q_zu, is equal to the mass flow rate, dot m, multiplied by the difference between the enthalpy at state 2, h_2, and the enthalpy at state 1, h_1, which equals 0.1578 kilojoules per second.

The enthalpy at state 2, h_2, is 243.168 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at state 1, h_1, is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
