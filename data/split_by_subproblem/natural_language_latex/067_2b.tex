Energy balance (Flow process 5-6):

Zero equals the total mass flow rate times the quantity of enthalpy at point 5 minus enthalpy at point 6 plus half of the square of velocity at point 5 minus half of the square of velocity at point 6.

This implies that half of the square of velocity at point 6 equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the temperature difference between point 5 and point 6 plus half of the square of velocity at point 5.

This further implies that the temperature at point 6 equals the temperature at point 5 times the power of the pressure ratio from point 6 to point 5 raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n, which equals 328.07 Kelvin.

This also implies that the velocity at point 6 equals the square root of the quantity of the specific heat at constant pressure times the temperature difference between point 5 and point 6 plus half of the square of velocity at point 5, all multiplied by 2, which equals 507.25 meters per second.
