b) State 2 thermodynamic equilibrium

- Implies that the temperature of gas 1,2 equals the equilibrium temperature 2 or the ice fraction at state 2 is greater than 0, and the ice fraction at state 2 is not equal to 1.
- Implies that the equilibrium temperature at state 2 equals the equilibrium temperature at state 1, which is 0 degrees Celsius (both phases are the same).
- Implies that the temperature of gas at state 2 is 0 degrees Celsius.

For an ideal gas, the product of pressure and volume equals the product of mass, the gas constant, and temperature.

- It holds, analogous to a), that the force equilibrium implies the pressure of gas at state 2 equals the pressure of gas at state 1, which is 1.5 bar.
- That is, refer to the previous point marked with an asterisk.
