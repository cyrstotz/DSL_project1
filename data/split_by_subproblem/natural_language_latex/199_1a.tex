The mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance minus the mass flow rate times the sum of the enthalpy at exit under certain conditions plus the heat transfer rate minus the work rate equals zero.

The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance plus the heat transfer rate minus the work rate.

The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance.

The enthalpy at exit equals the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius, from Table A-2, which is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at entrance equals the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius, from Table A-2, which is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at entrance and the enthalpy at exit.

This is calculated as 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram and 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 37.818 kilowatts.

The negative of the outgoing heat transfer rate equals the heat transfer rate minus the reference heat transfer rate, which is 37.818 kilowatts minus 100 kilowatts, resulting in -62.182 kilowatts.

The outgoing heat transfer rate equals 62.182 kilowatts.
