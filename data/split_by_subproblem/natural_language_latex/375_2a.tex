The graph is a plot on grid paper with the x-axis labeled as s in units of kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin, and the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin. The graph contains several curves and lines:
- There are three main curves labeled p0, p3, and p4/p4'.
- Points are marked on the graph and connected by lines, forming a cycle. The points are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The line connecting points 1 and 2 is vertical.
- The line connecting points 2 and 3 is curved upwards.
- The line connecting points 3 and 4 is vertical.
- The line connecting points 4 and 5 is curved downwards.
- The line connecting points 5 and 6 is vertical.
- The line connecting points 6 and 1 is horizontal.
