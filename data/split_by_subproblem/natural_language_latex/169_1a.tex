Energy balance stationary:

The heat input rate equals the heat output rate.

Zero equals the product of mass flow rate entering and specific enthalpy entering minus the product of mass flow rate exiting and specific enthalpy exiting plus the heat output rate.

This implies that the heat output rate equals the product of mass flow rate exiting and specific enthalpy exiting minus the product of mass flow rate entering and specific enthalpy entering, given that the mass flow rate entering equals the mass flow rate exiting.

The product of mass flow rate and the difference between specific enthalpy exiting and entering equals the integral from temperature T1 to T2 of the product of specific heat at constant pressure and the differential of temperature plus the product of specific volume at constant pressure and the difference between pressure p2 and p1.

Zero, since it is isobaric.
