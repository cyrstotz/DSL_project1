x1 is unknown.
The mass flow rate at exit, denoted as m dot subscript p,ab, equals the mass flow rate m dot times the ratio of h2 over h1.
The temperature T2 equals negative 22 degrees Celsius.

x1 equals 0 implies completely liquid.
x1 equals the ratio of s1 minus s1,f to s1,g minus s1,f.

The throttle is adiabatic with pressure p equal to the external pressure.

Entropy balance denoted by S dot:
m dot times (s4 minus s1) plus the sum of Q dot subscript i over T subscript i plus S dot generated.
