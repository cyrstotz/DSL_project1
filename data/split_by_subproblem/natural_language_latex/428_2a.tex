The text describes two graphs:

1. The first graph is a T-s diagram, which plots temperature (T) on the vertical axis and entropy (s) on the horizontal axis. This graph includes six labeled points, numbered from 1 to 6, connected by lines to form a closed loop. The connections between points 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4 are curved lines, while the connections between points 4 and 5, 5 and 6, and 6 and 1 are straight lines. Additionally, the region between points 1 and 2 is highlighted with diagonal shading.

2. The second graph is a P-v diagram, which plots pressure (P) on the vertical axis and specific volume (v) on the horizontal axis. Similar to the first graph, it consists of six points labeled from 1 to 6, connected by lines to form a closed loop. The lines connecting points 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4 are curved, whereas the lines connecting points 4 and 5, 5 and 6, and 6 and 1 are straight. The region between points 1 and 2 is also shaded with diagonal lines.
