The expression for \( T_{KF} \) is given by the integral from \( sa \) to \( se \) of \( \frac{a}{c} \) with respect to \( s \), which equals \( \frac{\Delta r_{CU}}{sa - se} \). This is further simplified to \( \frac{c (T2 - T1) + \psi (p2 - p1)}{c \ln (T2 / T1)} \).

In another expression, \( T_{KF} \) is given by \( \frac{\tau_{aus} - \tau_{ein}}{\ln (\tau_{aus} / \tau_{ein})} \), which equals \( 294.57 \) Kelvin.
