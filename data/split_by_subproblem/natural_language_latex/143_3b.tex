The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) equals \( p_{g,1} \) which is 1.4 bar, since the same pressure is still acting due to the atmosphere and weight.

The terms 'frictionless', 'frictionless and adiabatically reversible', and 'polytropic' are noted.

The ratio \( \frac{R + C_V}{C_V} \) equals \( k \) which is 1.263.

For the temperature progression, \( T_{g,2} \) equals \( T_{g,1} \) times the ratio \( \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{k-1}{k}} \), resulting in 273.15 Kelvin.
