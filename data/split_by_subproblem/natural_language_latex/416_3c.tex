Negative change in internal energy plus boundary work equals heat transfer from state 1 to state 2.

Negative mass of gas times volume times negative 500 kilojoules plus the integral from volume 1 to volume 2 of pressure times differential volume equals negative 1.367 kilojoules.

The integral from volume 1 to volume 2 of pressure times differential volume equals pressure times the difference between volume 2 and volume 1.

Volume 2 equals the mass of the gas times the gas constant times the temperature of the gas at state 2, divided by the pressure times the molar mass of the gas, which equals 1.105 liters.
