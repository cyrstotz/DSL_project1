The expressions are as follows:

- \( p_{g1} \, mg \) represents the product of \( p_{g1} \) and \( mg \).

- The area \( A \) is calculated as \( (5 \cdot 10^{-2})^2 \cdot \pi \) which equals \( 7.854 \, \text{m}^3 \cdot 10^{-3} \).

- The pressure calculation is \( 1 \, \text{bar} + 32 \, \text{kg} \cdot \frac{0.1}{A} \) which results in \( 1.041 \, \text{bar} \).

- The ideal gas law is represented by \( pV = mRT \).

- The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as \( \frac{8.314}{50} \).

- The mass \( m \) is calculated using the formula \( m = \frac{1.041 \cdot 3.141 \cdot 10^{-3}}{\frac{8.314}{50} \cdot 773.15} \) which equals \( 2.5426 \, \text{kg} \).
