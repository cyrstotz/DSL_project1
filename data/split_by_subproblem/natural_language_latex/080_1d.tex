In a semi-closed system:

The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to m2 times u2 minus m1 times u1 plus the sum of Q dot subscript j minus the sum of W dot superscript 0.

Delta E is equal to Delta U.

Delta U is equal to m dot times (h2 minus h1) plus the sum of Q dot subscript j plus the sum of W dot subscript j.

The change in mass, Delta m, is equal to Delta U plus Q subscript k12, which equals m dot times (h2 minus h1) plus Q subscript k12.

The change in enthalpy, Delta h, is h2 minus h1.

Delta U is equal to m dot times (h2 minus h1).

Delta h is the enthalpy at 200 degrees Celsius minus the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius, which equals 292.18 kilojoules per kilogram.

m dot is equal to Q subscript k12 divided by Delta h times (1 minus x).

Delta m is equal to negative Q subscript BR divided by Delta h times (1 minus w1), which equals 3.5 times 10 to the power of 6 kilograms divided by 207.35 times (1 minus 0.26) kilograms, resulting in 803.76 kilograms.

Delta m from the problem statement!

The change in entropy, Delta S subscript 12, is m2 times s2 minus m1 times s1.

This implies Delta m.
