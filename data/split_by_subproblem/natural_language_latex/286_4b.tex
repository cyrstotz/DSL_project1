The equations provided are as follows:

1. Q equals the product of m dot (mass flow rate) and the difference between h4 and h2, plus E dot Q (energy flow rate into the system) minus E dot W (energy flow rate out of the system).

2. m dot equals the mechanical work rate W dot mech divided by the difference between h3 and h2.

In the student solution:

1. m dot equals 28 grams per second divided by the difference between 266.15 and 243.2, which equals 4.1 kilograms per second times 1.4 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms per second, resulting in 1.4 kilograms per second.

2. This equals 1.368 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms per second, which equals 4.9742 kilograms per second.
