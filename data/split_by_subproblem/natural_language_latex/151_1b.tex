The average temperature T_AP is denoted as:

T_AP bar.

The average temperature T_AP is calculated as the integral of T with respect to s from s_e to s_a, divided by the difference s_a minus s_e, since there is no pressure change:

T_AP bar equals the integral from s_e to s_a of T ds, divided by s_a minus s_e.

The ratio of h_a minus h_e to s_a minus s_e equals the average temperature T_AP:

(h_a minus h_e) divided by (s_a minus s_e) equals T_AP bar.

The difference h_a minus h_e is given by the integral from T_1 to T_2 of c dT plus v times (p_2 minus p_1):

h_a minus h_e equals the integral from T_1 to T_2 of c dT plus v times (p_2 minus p_1).

The difference s_a minus s_e is given by the integral from T_1 to T_2 of c over T dT, possibly:

s_a minus s_e equals the integral from T_1 to T_2 of c over T dT, possibly.
