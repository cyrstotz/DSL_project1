The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat transfer rate minus the work done, which is represented by the equation:
\[ \frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m} (h_{\text{inlet}} - h_{\text{outlet}}) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W}^{\text{o}} \]

The heat transfer rate is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet, given by:
\[ \dot{Q} = \dot{m} (h_{\text{outlet}} - h_{\text{inlet}}) \]

This results in:
\[ = 0 \]

The enthalpy at the outlet is 449.09 kilojoules per kilogram and the enthalpy at the inlet is 292.88 kilojoules per kilogram, as shown in the equation:
\[ h_{\text{outlet}} = 449.09 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \quad h_{\text{inlet}} = 292.88 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \]

The temperature is 293.12 Kelvin:
\[ T = 293.12 \text{K} \]
