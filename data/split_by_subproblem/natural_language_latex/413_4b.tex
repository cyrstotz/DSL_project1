Given: mass flow rate of R134a.
The pressures P3 and P4 are both 8 bar.

Material process processes in the compressor: adiabatic, reversible.

Entropy balance: mass flow rate times (s2 minus s3) plus Q over T plus generated entropy equals zero.
s2 equals s3.

Energy balance: mass flow rate times (h2 minus h3) minus work rate equals zero.
Thus, the mass flow rate of R134a equals the work rate divided by (h2 minus h3).

State 2:
8 bar refers to Table A11.
The enthalpy h3f is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
The enthalpy h3g is 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram.
