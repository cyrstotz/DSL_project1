- Since the ice has not melted, the heat release was constant because the temperature was constant.
- Temperature and pressure must decrease as heat decreases.
- O.H. is the volume after heat flows from warm to cold!
- Gas and ice in thermodynamic equilibrium, meaning \( Q = 0 \)
- and \( T = 0^\circ \text{C} \) must have the same temperature as ice water (0°C)
- otherwise, there would be no ice left or it would be uniform.

The equation is:
\[
\frac{p_1 \cdot V_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2 \cdot V_2}{T_2}
\]

\[
\frac{500 \text{°C}}{0 \text{°C}} = \frac{p_2 \cdot 2.73 \cdot 10^5 \text{ Pa}}{273.15 \text{ K}}
\]

\[
= 0.49 \text{ bar}
\]

Student Solution:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}}
\]

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{0.2617}{2.837} \right)^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}}
\]

\[
p_2 = p_1 \Rightarrow \text{Pressure through } p_0 \text{ and mass has not changed}
\]
