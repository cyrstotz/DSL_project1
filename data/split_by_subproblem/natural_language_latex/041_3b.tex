Thermodynamic equilibrium in state 2.

T_g,2 equals T_ew,2.

Since the temperature in the solid-liquid area remains the same.

T_ew,2 equals T_ew,1, thus T_g,2 equals T_ew,1 equals 0 degrees Celsius.

p_g2 equals p_g1 equals 0.4 bar.

Because no mass is lost and the area remains the same,

thus, the same mass still presses on the same area.
