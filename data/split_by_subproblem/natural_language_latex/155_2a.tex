Graph Description: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled T in Kelvin and the horizontal axis labeled S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The vertical axis has tick marks at 243.15, 322.08, 431.9, and 1289. The horizontal axis has tick marks at 0, 1, 2, and 3. There are two curves on the graph. The first curve starts at the origin (0,0), goes through the point labeled 1, and then curves upwards to the right, passing through the point labeled 2. The second curve starts at the point labeled 3, goes upwards to the right, passing through the point labeled 4, and then curves downwards to the right, passing through the points labeled 5 and 6. The point labeled 4 is marked with P equals P2 and the point labeled 6 is marked with P equals P0.

List of processes:
- From point 0 to 1: adiabatic compression with a pressure of 0.191 bar.
- From point 1 to 2: adiabatic-reversible compression, isentropic.
- From point 2 to 3: isobaric heat addition.
- From point 3 to 4: adiabatic-irreversible turbine operation, entropy generation.
- From point 4 to 5: isobaric mixing chamber with a pressure of 0.5 bar.
- From point 5 to 6: reversible-adiabatic nozzle with a pressure of 0.191 bar, isentropic.
