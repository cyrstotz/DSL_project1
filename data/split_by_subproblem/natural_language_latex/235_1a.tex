Energy balance of the cooling jacket:

The derivative of energy with respect to time equals the sum over i of the mass flow rate of i times the quantity of enthalpy of i plus half the velocity of i squared plus g times the height of i, plus the sum over j of the heat flow rate of j, minus the sum over n of the work rate of n.

This equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat flow rate at the outlet.
