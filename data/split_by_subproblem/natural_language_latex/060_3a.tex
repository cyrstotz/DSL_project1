Item a) Required: \( p_{s1} \), \( m_{g} \)

Required: \( U_{s} = 50 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kmol}} \)

The equation \( pV = nRT \) is given.

\( T_{s1} = 500K \) and \( V_{s1} = 3.14L \)

\( R \) is calculated as \( \frac{R}{m} = \frac{8.31}{50} = 0.1662 \)

The pressure \( p \) is calculated using the formula:
\[
p = \frac{nRT}{V} = \frac{0.1662 \cdot 500}{3.14} = 3.54 \text{bar}
\]
