The rate of change of temperature, denoted as T dot, is equal to the integral from S_a to S_e of T times the derivative of Q with respect to S. This is represented graphically with a wavy line between S_a and S_e.

This expression simplifies to the ratio of the integral from S_a to S_e of T dS over the difference S_a minus S_e, which equals the sum of 788.75 kilojoules and 283.75 kilojoules divided by 2, resulting in 293.75 Kelvin.
