In the given equations:

1. The difference between \( m_{2S2} \) and \( m_{1S1} \) is equal to \( Am_{12}S_{12} \) plus \( S_{erz} \), where \( S_{erz} \) is specified as "no line".
2. \( S_{erz} \) is then calculated as \( m_{2S2} - m_{1S1} - Am_{12}S_{12} \), which equals \( 289.61 \frac{hJ}{K} \).

Additionally, \( m_{2S2} \) is given as \( 95.36.563 \).

For the entropy values:
- \( S_2 \), the entropy at \( 70^\circ C \), is \( 2.9849 \).
- \( S_1 \), the entropy at \( 100^\circ C \) with \( x = 0.005 \), is calculated as \( 0.005 \times 7.359 + (1 - 0.005) \times 1.3069 \), which approximately equals \( 1.33714 \).
- \( S_{12} \), the entropy at \( 20^\circ C \), is \( 0.2966 \).
