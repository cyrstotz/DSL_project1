s_5 is approximately equal to s_6, adiabatically reversible.

T_6 minus T_5 times the ratio of p_6 to p_5 raised to the power of (n-1) over n equals 43.1 degrees Celsius.

Equation 7.45: Q equals the total mass flow rate (dot m_ges) times the difference (h_5 minus h_6) plus the adiabatic heat flow rate (dot Q_adiabat) plus half the total mass flow rate times the square of w_5 minus half the total mass flow rate times the square of w_6.

The total mass flow rate times the square of w_5 minus half the square of w_6 equals the total mass flow rate times the difference (h_6 minus h_5), which implies that the square of w_5 plus two times the difference (h_5 minus h_6) minus the square of w_6.

The square root of the square of w_5 plus two times the specific heat capacity at constant pressure times the difference (T_5 minus T_6) minus the square of w_6 equals 220.479 meters per second.
