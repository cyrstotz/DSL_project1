The derivative of E dot with respect to time equals m dot times the difference between h sub e and h sub a times Q dot sub aus implies m dot times the difference between h sub a and h sub e equals negative Q dot sub aus equals c to the power of it times delta T times m dot.

c to the power of it times m dot equals negative Q dot sub aus divided by delta T equals 6.2182 kilojoules per second Kelvin.

The derivative of E dot with respect to time equals m dot times the difference between s sub e and s sub a times Q dot sub aus plus s sub rev.

Q dot sub aus divided by m dot times the difference between s sub e and s sub a equals Q dot sub aus divided by m dot times c to the power of it times the natural logarithm of T sub 2 divided by T sub 1 equals average T sub h equals 293.72 Kelvin.
