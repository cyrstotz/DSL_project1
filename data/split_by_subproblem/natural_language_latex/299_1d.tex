d) Change in enthalpy from state 1 to state 2? The temperature in the reactor is 700 degrees Celsius.

The equation is:
O equals the change in enthalpy from state 1 to state 2 times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 1, plus the heat flow into the reactor, minus the heat flow out.

The equation rearranged is:
The fraction of the heat flow out minus the heat flow into the reactor, divided by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 1, equals the change in enthalpy from state 1 to state 2.

For A-2: The enthalpy at state 1 at 400 degrees Celsius is 292.98 times 10 to the power of 3 and 83.96 times 10 to the power of 3.

For A-2: The enthalpy at state 2 at 70 degrees Celsius is 419.04 times 10 to the power of 3 and negative 35,000,000.

The change in enthalpy from state 1 to state 2 is calculated as:
(292.98 times 10 to the power of 3 minus 419.04 times 10 to the power of 3) divided by 83.96 times 10 to the power of 3 equals 0.3 kilograms per second, which equals 109.45 kilograms per second.
