The temperature \( T_{KF} \) is given by the integral from \( S_2 \) to \( S_1 \) of \( T \) with respect to \( S \), which equals \( \frac{q_{12}}{S_2 - S_1} \) and is further equal to \( \frac{h_2 - h_1}{S_2 - S_1} \).

Since it is an ideal fluid and isobaric,

\( h_2 - h_1 \) equals \( c \) times \( (T_2 - T_1) \).

\( S_2 - S_1 \) equals \( c \) times the natural logarithm of \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \).

Thus, \( T_{KF} \) simplifies to \( \frac{c (T_2 - T_1)}{c \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)} \),

which calculates to \( \frac{298.15 \text{ K} - 288.15 \text{ K}}{\ln \left( \frac{298.15}{288.15} \right)} \) resulting in \( 293.17 \text{ K} \).

\( T_2 \) is \( 298.15 \text{ K} \) and \( T_1 \) is \( 288.15 \text{ K} \).
