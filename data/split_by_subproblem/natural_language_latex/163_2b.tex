The equation (h_6 minus h_5) equals the fraction of (w_5 squared minus w_6 squared) over 2, implies w_6 equals the square root of (w_5 squared minus (h_6 minus h_5) times 2).

This equals the square root of (220 meters squared per second squared plus 104.15 kilojoules per kilogram times 2 times 10 to the power of 3 meters squared per second squared).

This results in 507.24 meters per second.
