The expression is the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry, plus the heat transfer rate.

First law of thermodynamics for the evaporator states that zero equals the mass flow rate.

The initial temperature is negative 20 degrees Celsius.

This implies that the lowest temperature is negative 26 degrees Celsius, which equals 247.15 Kelvin.

First law of thermodynamics at the compressor.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between exit and entry, plus the heat transfer rate.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between exit and entry, plus the work rate.

The mass flow rate equals the work rate divided by the difference in enthalpy between exit and entry, which equals 28 Watts divided by the difference in enthalpy between exit and entry.
