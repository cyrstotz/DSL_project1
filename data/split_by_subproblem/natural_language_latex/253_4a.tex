- Point 1 is located near the bottom left of the graph.
- Point 2 is located higher up and to the right of Point 1.
- Point 3 is located directly above Point 2.

Arrows indicate the transitions between these points:
- An arrow points from Point 1 to Point 2.
- Another arrow points from Point 2 to Point 3.

The points are labeled as follows:
- Point 1: "1"
- Point 2: "2,4"
- Point 3: "3"
