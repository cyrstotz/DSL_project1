Energy Balance: The change in internal energy U_e2 equals QR plus Q_e2.

The change in internal energy U_e2 equals the mass m_e2 times the specific internal energy u_e2 minus the mass m_e1 times the specific internal energy u_e1, where the mass of fuel m_f is 5755 kilograms, and the mass m_e2 equals the mass m_e1 plus the change in mass Delta m_e2.

The specific internal energy u equals 438.94 plus x_0 times (2506.5 minus 438.94) equals 429.38 kilojoules per kilogram, according to Table A-2.

The specific internal energy u_e2 at 30 degrees Celsius equals 246.6 kilojoules per kilogram, according to Table A-2.

The product of mass m_e1 and specific internal energy u_e1 plus the product of the change in mass Delta m_e2 and specific internal energy u_e2 equals QR plus the product of mass m_e1 and specific internal energy u_e1, which equals 7 times the change in mass Delta m_e2 times (Q_aus plus the product of mass m_e1 and specific internal energy u_e1 minus the product of mass m_e1 and specific internal energy u_e2) divided by the specific internal energy u_e2.

The change in mass Delta m_e2 equals.
