d) No work is supplied, only the currents and heat (graphical representation of a system with arrows indicating mass and energy flows). Exergy balance of the entire system (stationary):

0 equals the total mass flow rate times negative change in exergy due to streams plus exergy flow rate due to heat supply minus exergy flow rate due to losses.

Exergy flow rate due to heat supply equals one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the temperature times the heat flow rate, which equals the mass flow rate of component k times one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the temperature times the specific heat flow rate.

The total mass flow rate equals the mass flow rate of component k plus the mass flow rate of component M, which equals the mass flow rate of component k plus 5.293 times the mass flow rate of component k, resulting in 6.293 times the mass flow rate of component k.

The mass flow rate of component k equals the total mass flow rate divided by 6.293.

Therefore, 0 equals negative change in exergy due to streams plus one over 6.293 times one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the temperature times the specific heat flow rate minus the specific exergy loss rate.

The specific exergy loss rate equals one over 6.293 times one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the temperature times the specific heat flow rate minus the change in exergy due to streams, which equals 137.89 kilojoules per kilogram.

The absolute value of the change in exergy due to streams equals 19.78 kilojoules per kilogram.
