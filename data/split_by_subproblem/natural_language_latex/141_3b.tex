The pressure p equals the ambient pressure p_amb plus the expression M_e times g divided by the square of half the diameter D squared times pi, plus the expression M_e times g divided by the square of half the diameter D squared times pi, which equals 1 bar plus the fraction 32 times 9.81 divided by the fraction 5 squared divided by 4 times pi, plus the fraction 0.1 times 9.81 divided by the fraction 5 squared divided by 4 times pi.

This results in 1.40 bar.
