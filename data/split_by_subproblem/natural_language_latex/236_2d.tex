Exergy loss:

The rate of exergy loss to Sez is denoted as dot E subscript ver to Sez.

Exergy balance:

The derivative of dot E subscript x with respect to time, evaluated at zero and under stationary conditions, equals the sum over i of dot E subscript str, i plus the sum over j of dot E subscript Q, j under adiabatic conditions minus the sum over n of (dot W subscript n of t minus p subscript zero times the derivative of V of t with respect to time) minus dot E subscript ver.

The rate of exergy loss, dot E subscript ver, equals the rate of exergy of the stream, dot E subscript str, minus the work done to the outside, dot W, where no work is done to the outside.

The rate of exergy loss per total mass, dot E subscript ver over m subscript ges, equals the rate of exergy of the stream per total mass flow rate, dot E subscript str over dot m subscript ges, which implies that the specific exergy loss rate, dot e subscript ver, equals the specific exergy of the stream, e subscript str, which is 100 kilojoules per kilogram.
