The rate of exergy destruction for the stream, denoted as e-dot subscript ex,STR, is equal to the mass flow rate, m-dot, times the expression in square brackets. The expression inside the brackets is h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times the difference between s subscript 6 and s subscript 0, plus a term 'tolce'. This expression simplifies to m-dot times another expression in square brackets, which includes c subscript p times the difference between T subscript 6 and T subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times the expression in parentheses. The expression in parentheses includes c subscript p times the natural logarithm of the ratio T subscript 6 over T subscript 0 minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio p subscript 6 over p subscript 0 plus one-half times w subscript 6 squared minus one-half times w subscript 0 squared.
