Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat transfer rate into the system minus the heat transfer rate out of the system.

Q_out equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus Q_e.

The heat transfer rate out of the system equals negative 62.785 Watts per Kelvin.

The heat transfer rate into the system equals 100 kilowatts.

The mass flow rate equals 0.3 kilograms per second.

The enthalpy at the inlet equals 292.5 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at the outlet equals 415.04 kilojoules per kilogram.
