Graph description:
The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The y-axis is labeled T [K/J] and the x-axis is labeled S [J/kg K]. There are several isobaric lines labeled p equals p_0, p equals p_1, p equals p_2 from bottom to top. The process starts at point O, moves to point 1, then to point 2, and finally to point 3. From point 3, it moves to point 4, then to point 5, and finally back to point O. The lines connecting these points are curved, indicating non-linear processes.
