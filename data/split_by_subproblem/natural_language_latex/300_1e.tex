The change in entropy, denoted as Delta S, is equal to m2 times s2 minus m1 times s1, which is equal to Delta m1 times s2. The mass m2 is equal to m1 plus Delta m2, which equals 10,223.31 kilograms. The mass m1 is 5,755 kilograms. The entropy s2 is calculated as the average of s_f and s_g, since I know the entropy of boiling water. The entropy s1 is equal to x times s_g plus (1 minus x) times s_f, which equals 1.33774. The value of s_g is 7.3543, obtained from table A-2, and the resulting change in entropy, Delta S, is 36.828 megajoules per kilogram Kelvin. The value of s_f is 1.3063.
