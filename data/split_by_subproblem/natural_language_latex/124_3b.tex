Since \( x > 0 \), in the equilibrium state not all the ice has melted, so the ice-water mixture is at an equilibrium temperature of \( 0^\circ C \).

The pressure in this case is independent of the gas; it depends only on the mass of the water/ice, the weight, and the external pressure, which is constant without mass exchange.
