The total rate of heat transfer, denoted as Q-dot with subscript 'ges', times the rate of heat transfer per unit area, denoted as q-dot, times the derivative of entropy S with respect to time t, equals the sum of the product of mass m and entropy s, plus the rate of heat transfer Q-dot divided by temperature T, plus the rate of change of entropy, denoted as S-dot.
