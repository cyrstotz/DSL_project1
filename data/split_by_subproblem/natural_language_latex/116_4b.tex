The mass flow rate of R134a, and for the 1HS compressor:
The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference of h2 and h3 plus the compressor work rate.
It is adiabatic and reversible, thus s2 equals s3.
h2 equals (no value provided),
h3 equals (no value provided),
T2 equals Ti plus 6 hours equals 9 hours plus 7su6,
Ti equals 10k plus Tsmb.
