The change in entropy, denoted as Delta S_12, is equal to m_2 times S_2 minus m_1 times S_1, which simplifies to m_1 times the difference of S_2 and S_1 plus Delta m_12 times S_2.

From Table A-2, the value is approximately 0.950 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

Approximately, S_f at 100 equals 1.3069.

The change in entropy, Delta S_12, equals 1127.26 kilojoules per Kelvin.
