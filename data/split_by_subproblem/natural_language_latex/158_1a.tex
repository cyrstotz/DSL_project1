The heat input rate is denoted by Q dot subscript "zu".

The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to m subscript 2 times u subscript 2 minus m subscript 1 times u subscript 1.

The heat input rate, Q dot subscript "zu", is equal to m dot times the difference between u subscript 2 and u subscript 1.

The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to the change in internal energy, Delta U.

The temperature T subscript 1 is 343.15 Kelvin and the temperature T subscript 2 is 373.15 Kelvin.

The pressure p subscript 1 is 1 bar and the pressure p subscript 2 is 5 bar.

The heat input rate, Q dot subscript "zu", is 37 kilojoules per second.

The internal energy u subscript 1 is 288.15 Kelvin and the internal energy u subscript 2 is 258.15 Kelvin.

The heat input rate, Q dot subscript "zu", is 6.288 kilojoules per second.
