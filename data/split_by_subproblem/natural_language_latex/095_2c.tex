The change in exergy due to the stream, denoted as Delta e_x, str, is equal to the exergy of the storage minus the exergy of the sink. This is mathematically represented as:

Delta e_x, str equals e_x, sto minus e_x, sk.

This further simplifies to:

Delta e_x, str equals the expression (h_6 minus h_c minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus t_e plus p_e) minus the expression (h_0 minus h_c minus T_0 times (s_0 minus s_0) plus t_e plus p_e).

Simplifying further, we get:

Delta e_x, str equals h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus t_e plus p_e minus t_e minus p_e.

This can be rewritten in terms of specific heat capacity at constant pressure (c_p), temperatures (T_6 and T_0), and gas constant (R) as:

Delta e_x, str equals c_p times (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 times (c_p times the natural logarithm of T_6 over T_0 minus R times the natural logarithm of p_6 over p_0) plus one half times w_6 squared minus one half times w_0 squared.

Substituting numerical values, we have:

Delta e_x, str equals 1.006 kJ/kg K times (360 K minus 293.15 K) minus 293.15 K times (1.006 kJ/kg K times the natural logarithm of 360 over 293.15 minus 1.006 over 1.4 times the natural logarithm of 5.6 over 1) plus one half times 510 squared minus one half times 200 squared.

Finally, the change in exergy due to the stream, Delta e_x, str, is calculated to be:

Delta e_x, str equals 40.66 kJ/kg, enclosed in a box.
