- p1 equals p2
- T equals 6k, which is equal to T1 and T2

- 7th high school over compressor, Vp equals 250 watts

- O equals the mass flow rate of R134 times (h2 minus h3) plus the mass flow rate of R134 squared plus Wk divided by (h2 minus h3)

- The mass flow rate of R134 equals negative Wk divided by (h2 minus h3)

- T1 equals 40 degrees Celsius

- Graphical Description: There is a wavy line drawn horizontally across the page, representing some form of boundary or separation.

- h2 equals 249.53 kilojoules per kilogram

- h2 equals 587.36 kilojoules per kilogram

- s2 equals s3 equals 0.9 kilojoules

- s3 equals sf plus x3 times (sg minus sf) implies x3 equals (s3 minus sf) divided by (sg minus sf)

- h3 equals hf plus x3 times (hg minus hf)

- The mass flow rate of R134 equals Wk divided by (h4 plus x3 times (hg minus hf) minus h2)

- 0 equals the mass flow rate times R12 times (h2 minus h2) plus dot Qk

- h2 equals negative dot Qk divided by (the mass flow rate times R12) plus h2

- At p2 equals p1 equals p2 divided by p1 equals 3.3756 bar
