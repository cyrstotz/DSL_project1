Graph Description:

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled 'S' in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K) and the y-axis is labeled 'T' in Kelvin (K). The graph consists of six points labeled 0 through 5. The points are connected by various lines:

- A vertical line connects Point 0 to Point 1 and is labeled "isotherm".
- A horizontal line connects Point 1 to Point 2 and is labeled "isotherm".
- A diagonal line connects Point 2 to Point 3 and is labeled "45 degrees".
- A vertical line connects Point 3 to Point 4 and is labeled "isotherm".
- A horizontal line connects Point 4 to Point 5 and is labeled "isotherm".
- A vertical line connects Point 5 to Point 6 and is labeled "isotherm".

There are also several dashed lines indicating different isotherms and isentropes. The pressures at various points are labeled as 'p0 equals p6', 'p2 equals p5', 'p4', and 'pA'.
