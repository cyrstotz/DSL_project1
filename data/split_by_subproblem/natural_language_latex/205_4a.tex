The graph is a pressure-temperature diagram, denoted as p-T diagram. The vertical axis is labeled p in bars and the horizontal axis is labeled T in degrees Celsius. It features a dome-shaped curve that represents the phase boundary. Inside this dome, there are four points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is located on the left side of the dome, point 2 on the right side, point 3 is directly above point 2, and point 4 is directly above point 1. There are arrows showing the transitions between these points: from point 1 to point 4, from point 4 to point 3, from point 3 to point 2, and from point 2 back to point 1. The transition from point 2 to point 1 is specifically labeled as "isobar".
