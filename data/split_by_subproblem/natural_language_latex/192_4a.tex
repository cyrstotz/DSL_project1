Figure 1: The first graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as p and the horizontal axis labeled as T. The graph contains three lines:
- A straight line starting from the origin and going upwards to the right.
- Another straight line starting from the origin and going upwards to the left, forming an 'X' shape with the first line.
- A curved line starting from the bottom left, rising to a peak, and then descending to the bottom right. This curved line is labeled as "NO".
The intersection of the straight lines forms a triangular region, and the curved line passes through this region.

Figure 2: The second graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as p and the horizontal axis labeled as T. The graph contains a single straight line:
- A straight horizontal line starting from the left and extending to the right.
The horizontal axis has a point labeled T_i near the origin.
