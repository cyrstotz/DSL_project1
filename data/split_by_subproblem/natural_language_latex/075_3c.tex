The average temperature T_g2 is 0.003 degrees Celsius.

Given:

The change in energy Delta E equals Q (unreadable).

Given: The average temperature T_g2 equals the square root of the product of T_g1 and T_g2, which is 0.003 degrees Celsius.

The change in energy Delta E equals the product of nu and C_V times the quantity (T_g2 over T minus T) plus nu times W equals Q.

0.633 times (0.003 degrees Celsius minus 500 degrees Celsius) equals Q.

The square of the ratio of V_2 to V_1 equals the product of the ratio of v_2 to v_1 and the ratio of m_2 to m_1.

The mass m_2 equals mass m_1.

v_2 equals
