Graph 1:
The graph is a Temperature (T) versus Entropy (s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled s in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled T in Kelvin. The graph contains several curves and points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by lines indicating different processes. There are isobars and isotherms drawn, with one isobar labeled p0.

Graph 2:
The graph is another Temperature (T) versus Entropy (s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled s in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled T in Kelvin. The graph contains several curves and points labeled 2 through 6. The points are connected by lines indicating different processes. There are isobars and isotherms drawn, with one isobar labeled 0.5 bar.
