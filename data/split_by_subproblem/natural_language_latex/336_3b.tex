The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum of the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy, half the velocity squared, and the product of gravitational acceleration and height, plus the sum of heat transfer rates, minus the sum of work rates.

The sum of heat transfer rates minus the sum of work rates is equal to negative Q sub k minus Q sub ab, which equals W sub k minus 28 times W.
