The exergy efficiency, epsilon_ex, is equal to the ratio of the heat input rate, Q_dot_zu, to the sum of the heat output rate, Q_dot_ab, and the heat input rate, Q_dot_zu. This is expressed as epsilon_ex equals Q_dot_zu divided by the sum of Q_dot_ab and Q_dot_zu. Simplifying further, it equals Q_dot_zu divided by the difference between Q_dot and Q_dot_W.

The heat input rate, Q_dot_zu, equals the mass flow rate, m_dot, times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 1, which is m_dot times the difference between the enthalpy at state 2 under saturated conditions, h_g,2, and the enthalpy at state 1, h_1. And the work rate, Q_dot_W, equals 28 times Q_dot_W.
