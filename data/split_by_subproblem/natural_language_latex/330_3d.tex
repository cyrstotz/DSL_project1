In section d), the equations are as follows:

The kinetic energy \( E_K \) is equal to the rate of heat transfer \( \dot{Q} \) times the efficiency \( \eta \) divided by the absolute value of the rate of work \( \dot{W}_E \).

The rate of work \( \dot{W}_E \) is equal to the reversible work \( W_E^{rev} \) divided by the efficiency \( \eta \). This leads to the reversible work \( W_E^{rev} \) being equal to the negative integral from 1 to 2 of the volume \( v \) with respect to the change in pressure \( dp \).
