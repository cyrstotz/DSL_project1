The equations provided are as follows:

1. \( w_e = h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} \bigg|_2 \)
2. \( w_A^2 = 2h_5 - 2h_6 + w_e^2 - 2w_e \)
3. \( w_A' = 2c_p ( T_5 - T_6 ) + \left( 2000 \frac{m}{s} \right)^2 2w_e \)
4. \( w_s = 3.16 \frac{m}{s} \)

Graph Description:
The graph is a line plot with five points labeled from 1 through 5. The x-axis starts from the origin (0,0) and extends to the right, while the y-axis extends upwards from the origin. The points are connected in the following manner:

- Point 1 is located at the origin.
- Point 2 is positioned directly above Point 1 on the y-axis.
- Point 3 is to the right of Point 2 and slightly higher, showing an increase in both x and y values.
- Point 4 is to the right of Point 3 but at a lower y value, indicating a decrease in y but an increase in x.
- Point 5 is directly below Point 4 on the x-axis, showing a decrease in y value.

The graph is labeled with "Isotherm" near Point 3.
