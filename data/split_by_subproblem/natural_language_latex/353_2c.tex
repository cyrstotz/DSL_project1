The change in the error term for X,STR, denoted as Delta dot e subscript X,STR, is equal to e subscript X,STR6 minus e subscript X,STR0, which is further expressed as:

h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0) plus one-half times (w6 squared minus w0 squared).

This can be rewritten as:

c subscript p superscript 16 AIR times (T6 minus T0) minus T0 times c subscript p superscript 16 AIR times (the natural logarithm of T6 over T0 minus R times the natural logarithm of v6 over v0) plus one-half times (510 meters per second squared minus w0 squared).

This approximately equals 112.21 kilojoules per kilogram.
