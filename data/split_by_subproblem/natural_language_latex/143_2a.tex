Graph 1: A temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram with several curves and points labeled. The x-axis is labeled s (kJ/kgK) and the y-axis is labeled T (K). There are five points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, point 4 is below point 3, and point 5 is to the left of point 4. There are several curves connecting these points, indicating different processes. There is a note "no point" near the middle of the diagram. The following labels are present:
- p2 equals p3
- S1 equals S2
- p4 equals p5 equals 0.5 bar
- p1 equals 0.5 bar
- S5 equals S6

Graph 2: Another temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram with the x-axis labeled s (kJ/kgK) and the y-axis labeled T (K). There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Point 0 is at the bottom left, point 1 is above point 0, point 2 is above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, point 4 is below point 3, and point 5 is below point 4. There are several curves connecting these points, indicating different processes. The following labels are present:
- p1 equals p4 equals p5
- pressures p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5 are indicated.
