For the part labeled "d) Q_aus for T_2 equals 70 degrees Celsius?":

- "Inkalbfferenz System" (which seems to be a typographical or translation error, possibly intended to mean "Internal Difference System" or a specific technical term in context).
  
- The equation implies mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy (h_2 minus h_1) equals the input mass flow rate plus Q_out minus work (W).
