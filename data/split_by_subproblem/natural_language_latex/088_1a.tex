Energy equation around the reactor:
- The rate of entropy change S dot from state 1 to 2 equals zero.
- The rate of change of energy E with respect to time equals the sum of the mass flow rate m dot times the sum of enthalpy h and the ratio of pressure p times specific volume e over density rho, plus the sum of heat transfer rate Q dot, minus the sum of work rate W dot, which equals zero.
- The mass flow rate m dot times the difference in enthalpy from inlet (h subscript "in") to outlet (h subscript "out"), plus the heat transfer rate at state 2 Q dot subscript 2, minus the heat transfer rate at the outlet Q dot subscript "out", equals zero.
- The heat transfer rate at the outlet Q dot subscript "out" equals the heat transfer rate at state 2 Q dot subscript 2 plus the mass flow rate m dot times the difference in enthalpy from inlet to outlet, which equals 62.182 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The heat transfer rate at state 2 Q dot subscript 2 equals 100 kilowatts.
- The enthalpy at the inlet h subscript "in" at 200 degrees Celsius equals 292.88 kilojoules per kilogram, and the enthalpy at the outlet h subscript "out" at 100 degrees Celsius equals 418.04 kilojoules per kilogram.
