The equations and conditions given are as follows:

1. The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3 equals the electrical power output:
   \[
   \dot{m} \left[ h_2 - h_3 \right] = \dot{W}_{\text{el}}
   \]

2. The mass flow rate is equal to the electrical power output divided by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3:
   \[
   \dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_{\text{el}}}{h_2 - h_3}
   \]

3. The following conditions are set:
   - The pressure at state 1 equals the pressure at state 2.
   - The entropy at state 2 equals the entropy at state 3.
   - The pressure at state 3 is 8 bar.
   - The pressure at state 3 equals the pressure at state 4.
   - The quality at state 4 is 0 and the quality at state 2 is 1.
   - The temperature at state 1 equals the temperature at state 4, and the evaporation temperature is 9 degrees Celsius.
   - The indoor temperature is 10 degrees Celsius, and the enthalpy at state 1 equals the enthalpy at state 4.
