1.083 kilojoules are released.

The equation m times (u2 minus uA1) equals Q. Therefore, u2 equals Q divided by m plus uA, which calculates to (1.083 times 10 to the power of 3) divided by 0.1 plus (-200.093 times 10 to the power of 3), resulting in -188.26 kilojoules per kilogram.

For uA: uA equals -0.045 times 10 to the power of 3 plus 0.6 times (-333.458 times 10 to the power of 3 minus (-0.045 times 10 to the power of 3)), which equals -200.093 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, u2 equals uA1 plus x times (uE1 minus uA1). Thus, (u2 minus uA1) divided by (uE1 minus uA1) equals x, which calculates to (-188.26 times 10 to the power of 3 plus 0.045 times 10 to the power of 3) divided by (-333.458 times 10 to the power of 3 plus 0.045 times 10 to the power of 3), resulting in 0.568 or 56.8 percent.
