Required: The rate of change of kinetic energy, denoted as \(\dot{E}_k\), equals the ratio of the heat input rate \(\dot{Q}_{zu}\) to the work rate \(\dot{W}_t\), with \(\dot{W}_t\) equal to 28 watts.

Energy analysis from state 1 to state 5: The mass flow rate \(\dot{m}\) times the difference in enthalpy \(h_1 - h_2\) plus the heat transfer rate \(\dot{Q}\) equals zero.
\[
\dot{Q} = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_1)
\]
Substituting values, we get:
\[
\dot{Q} = 4 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{h}} \cdot \frac{1}{3600} \left( 93.49 - 234.28 \right)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\dot{Q} = 9.173 \, \text{kW}
\]

Thus, the rate of change of kinetic energy \(\dot{E}_k\) is 6.18.
