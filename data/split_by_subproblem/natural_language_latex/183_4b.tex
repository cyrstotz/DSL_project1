Energy conservation of the compressor:

Zero equals the mass flow rate of component k times the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and enthalpy at state 3, minus the power input to component k.

(For high entropy s2 equals s3, no high on soul h1 equals h4 at 8 bar)

Enthalpy at state 4 (Plan) equals h_p equals 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

The outlet pressure is p1 Siphon equals p2 which is less than 0.005 bar.

Entropy at 1 bar equals s_g at 1 bar equals 0.9395 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Enthalpy at 1 bar equals h_g at 1 bar equals 231.35 kilojoules per kilogram.

Enthalpy at state 3 as a function of entropy at state 2 equals 267.83 plus the fraction (278.0 minus 267.83) divided by (0.9379 minus 0.9385) times (0.9385 minus 0.938) equals 268.11 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, the efficiency eta_R,1234 equals the power input to component K divided by the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and enthalpy at state 3.
