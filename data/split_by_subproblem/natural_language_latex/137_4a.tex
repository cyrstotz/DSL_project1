The graph description includes a plot with the vertical axis labeled as p(bar) and the horizontal axis labeled as T(K). There are three processes indicated on the graph:
- Process from (i) is a vertical line starting from point i and going upwards to point i2.
- Process from (ii) is a horizontal line starting from point i2 and going to the right to point i1. This line is labeled as "isobar".
- Process from (iii) is a vertical line starting from point i1 and going downwards to point i.
