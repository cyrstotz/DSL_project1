Adiabatic Process: The rate of heat transfer, Q dot, equals zero.

Empirical: Look, the rate of mechanical energy change, E dot mechanical, equals T zero times the rate of mechanical entropy change, S dot mechanical.

The equation zero minus Q dot mechanical plus m times (s two minus s zero) equals the process entirely under P-G-P.

The equation for the rate of mechanical energy change per unit mass flow rate, E dot mechanical over m dot, equals T zero times the rate of mechanical entropy change, S dot mechanical, which equals T zero times c p times the natural logarithm of (T two over T zero), equals 8.1.5 kilojoules per second.
