The content includes a table and a description of a graph:

The table has two columns, but only the header of the first column is labeled as "p [bar]" which stands for pressure in bars. The rows beneath the header are not filled with data but are labeled with "Triple point", "Vapor", "Liquid", and "Solid".

Following the table, there is a description of a graph:
The graph is a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram. The vertical axis (y-axis) is labeled "p [bar]" indicating pressure in bars, and the horizontal axis (x-axis) is labeled "T [K]" indicating temperature in Kelvin. The graph features a curve that originates from the bottom left (origin), ascends to a peak labeled "Triple point", and then descends. The areas under the curve are categorized and labeled as "Solid" on the left side, "Liquid" in the middle, and "Vapor" on the right side.
