The equations provided are as follows:

1. The change in kinetic energy, denoted as delta e_kin,istr, equals the difference between the initial and final exergy, which is represented as delta e_ex,istr.

2. The change in exergy for an isentropic process, delta E_ex,istr, is given by the formula:
   delta E_ex,istr equals the mass flow rate, dot m, times the difference in enthalpy (h_6 minus h_2) minus the product of the reference temperature T_0 and the difference in entropy (s_6 minus s_2), plus half the difference between the square of the initial velocity w_2 and the final velocity w_6.

3. For an ideal gas, the difference in enthalpy (h_6 minus h_2) equals the specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, times the temperature difference (T_6 minus T_2). The difference in entropy (s_6 minus s_2) equals c_p times the natural logarithm of the temperature ratio (T_6 over T_2) minus the gas constant R times the natural logarithm of the enthalpy ratio (h_6 over h_2).

4. The change in exergy for an isentropic process, delta E_ex,istr, is also expressed as:
   delta E_ex,istr equals the mass flow rate, dot m, times c_p times the difference (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 times the sum of c_p times the natural logarithm of the temperature ratio (T_6 over T_0) plus half the difference between the square of the initial velocity w_2 and the final velocity w_6 squared.

5. The temperature T_6 is given as 396 Kelvin, and the initial velocity w_2 is 536 meters per second.

6. The final expression for delta E_ex,istr is the same as the fourth equation but evaluated to give a numerical result of negative 26258672.5 Joules, indicating an energy loss.
