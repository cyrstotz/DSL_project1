The equations are as follows:

1. The extended exergy loss, denoted as \( E_{\text{ex, verl}} \), is equal to the change in mass \( \Delta m_1 \) multiplied by the specific exergy \( e_{\text{ex, str}} \), plus the term \( \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_1} \right) \) multiplied by \( Q_1 \), minus the change in exergy \( \Delta E_{\text{ex}} \).

2. The extended exergy loss, \( E_{\text{ex, verl}} \), is equal to the specific exergy \( e_{\text{ex, str}} \), plus the fraction \( \frac{1 - T_0}{T_1} \) multiplied by \( Q \), minus the change in exergy \( \Delta E_{\text{ex}} \).

3. The change in exergy, \( \Delta E_{\text{ex}} \), is equal to zero times the extended exergy loss \( E_{\text{ex, verl}} \) plus the change in kinetic exergy \( \Delta e_{\text{ex, ke}} \).
