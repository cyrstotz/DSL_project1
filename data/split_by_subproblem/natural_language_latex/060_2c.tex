Energy equation:
- The energy equation E_x,str equals the expression in square brackets, which is h_1 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_1 minus s_0), plus w squared over 2.
- E_x,str equals the expression in square brackets, which is h_0 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0), plus w squared over 2.
- E_x,str equals the integral from T_0 to T_1 of c_p times the derivative of T with respect to T over T, dt, which equals c_p times the derivative of T with respect to T over T times dt minus 2h times the ratio of P_1 over P_0, plus w_2 squared over 2.

- Zero times epsilon_x,str equals 1.006 times (328.1 minus 243.15) minus 243.15 over 380 times 1006 Joules per kilogram times the ratio of 328.1 over 243.15 minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_1 over T, plus 400.55 squared over 2.
- Zero times epsilon_x,str equals 80.2 times 1.17 Joules per kilogram, which equals 80.2 kiloJoules per kilogram.
