Entropy balance for flow processes in the refrigeration cycle:

The rate of entropy change is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the inlet and the outlet, plus the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature, plus the generated entropy rate, which is canceled out because there is no pressure loss, equals zero.

This implies that the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the outlet and the inlet.

This further implies that the heat transfer rate is equal to the negative of the heat transfer rate at the outlet, and the heat transfer rate at the inlet is equal to the negative of the heat transfer rate at the outlet divided by the mass flow rate, which equals 207.273 kilojoules per kilogram.

The difference between the entropy at the outlet and the inlet is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the temperature at the outlet to the temperature at the inlet.
