The rate of change of \( e_{x1} \) with respect to time, denoted as \( \dot{e}_{x1} \), is equal to the sum of \( \dot{E}_{x1,dir} \) and \( \dot{E}_{x1,Q} \) minus the product of \( \dot{V}_u \) and the difference between \( e_0 \) and the rate of change of \( \Delta U(t) \) with respect to time. This is equal to \( \dot{E}_{x1,vel} \).

It implies that \( \dot{e}_{x1,vel} \) is equal to the sum of \( \dot{e}_{x1,dir} \) and \( \dot{e}_{x1,Q} \).

The term \( \dot{e}_{x1,Q} \) is defined as the ratio of \( \dot{E}_{x1,Q} \) to \( \dot{m} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{\dot{m}} \) times the product of \( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \) and \( \dot{Q} \), and further simplifies to \( \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) q \cdot y \).

The value of \( q \) is given as 1785 kilojoules per kilogram and \( T \) is 1725 Kelvin.

The value of \( \dot{e}_{x1,vel} \) is calculated as 116.60 kilojoules per kilogram plus the product of 869.58 and the reciprocal of 6.293, in kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 270.67 kilojoules per kilogram.

The variable \( y \) is defined as \( \dot{m} \).

The mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{inges} \) is the sum of \( \dot{m}_K \) and 5.253 times \( \dot{m}_K \).

The value of \( \dot{m}_K \) is the ratio of \( \dot{m} \) to 6.293, defined as \( \text{inges} \).
