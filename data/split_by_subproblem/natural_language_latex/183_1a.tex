a) Energy balance in the reactor:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat transfer rate into the reactor, plus the heat transfer rate out of the reactor (where the heat transfer rate out of the reactor is negative because heat is being released).

The enthalpy at the inlet at 70 degrees Celsius equals the enthalpy at constant pressure at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 282.88 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at the outlet at 100 degrees Celsius equals the enthalpy at constant pressure at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat transfer rate out of the reactor equals the negative of the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the external heat transfer rate.

This equals negative 62.18 kilowatts.
