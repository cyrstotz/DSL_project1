The temperature T subscript g, 2 equals the temperature T subscript Ew, 1, which is 0.0 degrees Celsius.

The pressure p subscript g, 2 equals the pressure p subscript g, 1.

- The external pressure is the same as in state 1.
- Since there is still ice in the water, all the heat is used for melting.
- In equilibrium, the temperature and the ice content do not change further.
