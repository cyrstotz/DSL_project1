The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as "1" and the y-axis labeled as "1". There are three curves on the graph:
- The first curve is labeled "isotherm" and is a concave curve starting from the origin and increasing.
- The second curve is labeled "adiabatic" and is a straight line starting from the origin and increasing at a steeper angle than the isotherm.
- The third curve is labeled "polytropic" and is a curve that lies between the isotherm and adiabatic curves.

Points on the graph are labeled as follows:
- Point "1" is at the intersection of the isotherm and polytropic curves.
- Point "2" is at the intersection of the polytropic and adiabatic curves.
- Point "P" is at the intersection of the isotherm and adiabatic curves.
