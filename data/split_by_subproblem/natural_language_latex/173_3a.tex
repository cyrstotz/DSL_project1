Graph description: The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (p-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled T in kilojoules and the y-axis is labeled p in pascals. The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is at the bottom right, point 3 is at the top right, and point 4 is at the top left. The loop is a dome-shaped curve with the top part being a smooth curve and the bottom part being a straight horizontal line connecting points 1 and 2. The pressure at point 1 is labeled as p1 equals 1 bar and the temperature at point 1 is labeled as T1 equals negative 10 degrees Celsius.
