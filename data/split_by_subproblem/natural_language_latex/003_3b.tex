Change in energy, denoted as Delta E, equals c_v times m_g times Delta T. The pressure p_{g2} equals p_{g1} which is 1.4 bar, implying that mass and gravitational acceleration do not change. The mass of ice, m_{ice}, equals x_1 times m_{EL} which is 0.6 times 0.1, resulting in 0.06 kilograms. The mass of water, m_W, is calculated as (unreadable) times (1 minus 0.1) times 0.6, resulting in 0.054 kilograms. The change in energy, Delta E, equals E_2 minus E_1 which is the sum of Q_i minus the sum of W_i. The equation c_v times m_g times T_{gn} plus m_{ice} times u_{test} plus m_W times u_{test} equals E_n. Another equation is c_v times m_g times the average T plus m_{ice} times u_{test} times the average T plus m_W times u_{test} times the average T equals E_2.
