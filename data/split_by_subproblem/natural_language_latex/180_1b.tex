The average temperature T-bar is equal to the integral from a to b of T dS divided by the difference S_a minus S_e.

T-bar equals the difference h_a minus h_e divided by the difference S_a minus S_e.

T-bar equals 293.214.

S_a, from A-2, equals 0.3674.

S_e, from A-2, equals 0.2445.

h_e, from A-2, equals 62.55.

h_a, from A-2, equals 124.85.
