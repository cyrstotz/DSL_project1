a) stationary flow process with mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \)

The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q} \) equals the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference in enthalpy \( h_a - h_e \) plus \( \dot{Q} \) leading to \( W^0 \).

The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q} \) equals the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference in enthalpy \( h_a - h_e \).

The outgoing heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \).

The sum of the heat transfer rate due to radiation \( \dot{Q}_R \), the outgoing heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} \), and the incoming heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{in}} \) equals zero.

The incoming heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{in}} \) equals the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference in enthalpy \( h_a - h_e \), which is equal to the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the specific heat capacity \( c \) times the change in temperature \( \Delta T \).

The change in temperature \( \Delta T \) is 10 Kelvin.
