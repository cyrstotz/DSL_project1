The graph description includes a plot with the x-axis labeled as 's' and the y-axis labeled as 'T'. It features several lines and curves. The origin is marked as '0'. There are six points labeled from '0' to '6' along the curves, which are connected by lines. Annotations on the graph include 'p2 equals p3', 'p4 is less than p3', 'p4 equals p6', '0.5', '4.3', '1.9K', and '0.1971'. Labels such as 'adiabatic', 'isobaric', and 'isochoric' are noted along the curves. The temperature 'T' is indicated as '-30 degrees' at the bottom left of the graph.
