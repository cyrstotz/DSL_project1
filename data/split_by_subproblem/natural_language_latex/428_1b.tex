Coolant as an ideal fluid with constant \( c_i \): \( c_i(T_1) = c_i(T) \)

The change in entropy from \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \) is equal to the integral from \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \) of \( \frac{c_i(T)}{T} \) with respect to \( T \), which leads to the average temperature \( \bar{T} \) being equal to the integral from \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \) of \( \frac{c_i(T)}{T} \) divided by \( s_{\text{m}} - s_{\text{e}} \).

The integral from \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \) of \( \frac{c_i(T)}{T} \) with respect to \( T \).

The heat transfer per unit average temperature \( \frac{q}{\bar{T}} \) is equal to the integral from \( s_{\text{m}} \) to \( s_{\text{e}} \) of \( \frac{c_i}{T} \) with respect to \( s \).

The rate of heat transfer \( \dot{Q} \) is equal to the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the integral from \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \) of \( \frac{c_i}{T} \) with respect to \( T \).

The rate of heat transfer \( \dot{Q} \) is equal to the average of the inlet and outlet temperatures \( \frac{T_{\text{ein}} + T_{\text{aus}}}{2} \), which equals 259.15 Kelvin.

For the turbine, the mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{\text{Turbine}} \) from state 1 to 2 is given by \( S(1+2) = \dot{m} \times 7.0008 \times 10^{-3} \) cubic meters per second.

The volume flow rate at \( 700 \) degrees Celsius is \( 1.0433 \times 10^{-3} \) cubic meters per second.

The rate of change of entropy \( \frac{ds}{dt} \) is equal to the rate of entropy generation \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) plus the rate of heat input per temperature \( \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{in}}}{T} \).

The change in entropy flow rate due to mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is equal to the negative of \( \frac{62.182 \text{kW}}{253.15 \text{K}} \) plus the rate of entropy generation \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \).

The rate of entropy generation \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is equal to \( 0.2 \) kilograms per second times the difference in volume flow rates plus the ratio of \( 62.182 \text{kW} \) to \( 253.15 \text{K} \), resulting in \( 203.586 \) microjoules per Kelvin.
