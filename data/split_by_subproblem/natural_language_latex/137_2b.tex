- 1 HS, notation
- stationary: Q equals zero, omega equals zero

Zero equals m dot times (h5 minus h6 plus (omega5 squared minus omega6 squared) divided by 2).

This equals m dot times c_p times (T5 minus T6) plus y5 times (omega5 squared divided by 2) minus y6 times (omega6 squared divided by 2).

Omega6 equals the square root of (omega5 squared plus 2 times c_p times (T5 minus T6)).

- AS equation:

Zero equals m dot times (h2 minus h3) plus Q.

- adiabatic plus reversible equals isentropic

T6 minus T5 equals (P6 over P5) raised to the power of ((k minus 1) over k) equals 831.94 times (0.459 bar over 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (0.4 over 1.4) equals 328.07 Kelvin.

Omega0 equals the square root of (270 meters per second squared plus 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (831.94 minus 328.07 Kelvin)) equals 507.25 meters per second.
