The problem describes a graph:
- The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as P and the horizontal axis labeled as T.
- The graph begins at the origin and displays a curve that starts with a steep slope and gradually flattens out as it extends to the right.
- There is a point marked on the curve, which is labeled as "critical".
