The pressure \( p_{3\Delta} \) equals 140.054 Pascals.

The external pressure that the gas must counteract is still the same, so the gas pressure remains the same as well.

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is 0 degrees Celsius.

Since it is still ice water, the temperature of the ice water does not change until all the ice has melted, and since the gas is in equilibrium, it also assumes a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius.
