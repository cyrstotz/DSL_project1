For the section labeled "gas: AM12":

- At point Z1:
  - Temperature T1 is 100 degrees Celsius.
  - The value x1 is 0.005.
  - The mass flow rate of the gas, denoted as m-dot-gas, is 5795 kilograms.

- At point Z2:
  - Temperature T2 is 70 degrees Celsius.
  - AB Men: Temperature Tgn is 20 degrees Celsius.
  - The heat transfer QR,12, also known as Qaus, is 35000 kilojoules.
  - At Z2 raised to the power of 1 minus m2, x equals 0.100 percent (Note: there is an exclamation mark which might indicate emphasis or a special note).

- The text "halbieren (m√ºsse ein)" translates to "halve (must be one)" which might be an instruction or note within the calculation.
  
- The equation M2 U2 minus M1 U1 equals Delta m-ein times h-ein plus QR,12.
- Delta m-ein is calculated as (M2 U2 minus M1 U1 minus QR,12) divided by h-ein.
- The value of h-ein is 53.96 kilojoules per kilogram.
- M2 equals (M1 plus Delta m).
- M1 is 5795 kilograms.
- At U1 equals 84.72 kilojoules per kilogram-m, which equals 420.377 kilojoules per kilogram.
- U2 is 292.955 kilojoules per kilogram.
- QR,12 is 35000 kilojoules.
- Delta m is calculated as (-M1 U2 plus M1 U1 plus QR,12) divided by (U2 minus h-ein).
- The instruction "Calculate with values on left and formula above" is given.
- Delta m is calculated to be 3642.29 kilograms.
