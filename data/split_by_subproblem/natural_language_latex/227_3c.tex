The change in energy, denoted as Delta E, is equal to the change in internal energy Delta U plus the change in kinetic energy (v squared over 2) plus the change in the term (p over rho). This is equal to the heat added Q minus the work done W prime. This can be rewritten as u2 minus u1 equals Q minus W prime, and further simplified to cv times (u2 minus T1) equals Q. Substituting the values, Q equals Q times (1.633 kg per K) times (273.153 K minus 773.15 K).

Finally, Q is equal to plus 346.4887.
