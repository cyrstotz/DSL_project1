The pressure \( p_{3,2} \) equals the pressure \( p_{g,1} \) and the temperature \( T_{g,2} \) equals the temperature \( T_{g,1} \).

The membrane and piston are frictionless (and they can obviously move). Therefore, the pressure in the gas "room" is always equal to the external pressure (\( p_{\text{ges,alt}} \)) and the pressure in the EW "room" is always equal to the pressure in the gas "room".

EW (is) incompressible,

In the second part:

The pressure \( P_{g1} \) equals the pressure \( P_{g2} \) and the temperature \( T_{g1} \) equals the temperature \( T_{g2} \).

EW is incompressible, the pressure in EW does not change with \( x_{EW} \). Therefore, the pressure in \( g_{EW} \) also does not change, implying that the pressure at \( g_{EW} \) does not change. \( P_{g1} = P_{g2} \) indicates no change in gas, hence \( T_{g1} = T_{g2} \). \( T_{g2} = 0 \) because EW and \( g_{g2} \) are in equilibrium, \( T_{ew2} = T_{g2} \). \( T_{ew1} = 0^\circ \) because \( T_{ew} = 0 \), thus \( T_{g1} = 0 \). There is still a mixture of solid and liquid.
