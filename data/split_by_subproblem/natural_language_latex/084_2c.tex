The rate of energy input due to the stream, denoted as E dot subscript in, str, equals the mass flow rate of the exhaust stream, denoted as m dot subscript ex, str, which equals m dot times the expression in square brackets. The expression inside the brackets is h minus h subscript zero minus T subscript zero times (s minus s subscript zero) plus k times e squared over 2 plus p times e squared over 2.

This simplifies to m dot times the expression in square brackets, which is h minus h subscript zero minus T subscript zero times (s minus s subscript zero).
