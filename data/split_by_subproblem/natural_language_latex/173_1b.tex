The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum of the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy, kinetic energy, and potential energy, plus the sum of heat flow rate minus the sum of work flow rate.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance plus half the difference between the square of the velocity at the exit and the square of the velocity at the entrance.

The sum of the enthalpy and half the square of the velocity at the exit equals the sum of the enthalpy and half the square of the velocity at the entrance.

The velocity at the exit equals the square root of two times the sum of the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance plus half the square of the velocity at the entrance.

The enthalpy at the exit is referenced from Table A-22.

X1 equals 240 Kelvin.

X2 equals 243.15 Kelvin.

X3 equals 250 Kelvin.

The velocity of air is 200 meters per second.

y1 equals 210.02.

y2 equals 250.05.

y3 equals 243.17945 kilojoules per kilogram, which is the enthalpy at the exit.

y equals the ratio of the difference between x and X1 to the difference between X2 and X1, multiplied by the difference between y2 and y1, plus y1.

T6 equals 3610 Kelvin.

The enthalpy at the exit is 316.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

Refer to Table A-22.
