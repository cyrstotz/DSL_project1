The kinetic energy E_k is equal to the fraction of m dot over m dot plus one, which simplifies to the fraction of m dot plus one over m dot plus one. This results in:

E_k equals the fraction of m dot over m dot plus one equals the fraction of m dot plus one over m dot plus one.

The product of m dot and the difference between h_1 and h_2 equals 0.164 kilojoules per second.

m dot equals the fraction of 4 kilograms over 3600 seconds.

Therefore, E_k equals 5.187.
