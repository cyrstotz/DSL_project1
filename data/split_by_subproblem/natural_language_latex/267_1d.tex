Item d) 
- E - 3.1: Lanz - 2 (open, adiabatic since the sum of heat flow in and heat flow out equals zero, isochoric).
- The internal energy U equals u_2 times (m_1 plus a times m_2), which equals the mass flow rate of 1 times u_1 plus the mass flow rate of 2 times u_2.
- a times m_2 equals the mass flow rate of 1 times (u_1 minus u_2) divided by (u_2 minus u_1), which equals 3756.84 kilograms.
- u_2 equals the specific internal energy at 70 degrees Celsius per kilogram squared, which equals 292.75 kilojoules per kilogram.
- u_2 equals the specific internal energy at 70 degrees Celsius plus x_0 times (the specific internal energy of gas at 70 degrees Celsius minus the specific internal energy at 70 degrees Celsius) per kilogram squared, which equals 492.3778 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The specific enthalpy of input is given by
