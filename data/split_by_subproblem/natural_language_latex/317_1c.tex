The section discusses the entropy principle around a system, stationary with mass flow. The equation given is:

Zero equals the secondary-saturation mass flow rate plus the heat flow rate out divided by the condensation temperature plus the entropy generation rate.

This is followed by an arrow pointing downwards, indicating a transformation or continuation, which leads to:

Equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the entropy in and the entropy out.
