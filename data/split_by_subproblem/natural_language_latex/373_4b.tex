Energy equation at the compressor: zero equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 1) minus power input to the compressor. The mass flow rate equals the power input to the compressor divided by (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 1).

- The sum of enthalpy at state 2 and enthalpy at state 2 equals the enthalpy at saturation condition at 22 degrees Celsius, no interpolation needed.
- Enthalpy at state 2 equals the saturation enthalpy at 6 bar, which is 261.15 kilojoules per kilogram.
- Enthalpy at state 2 at 22 degrees Celsius equals the saturation enthalpy at 0 degrees Celsius plus the difference between the saturation enthalpy at 2 degrees Celsius and the saturation enthalpy at 0 degrees Celsius divided by 2.
- This results in 268.38 kilojoules per kilogram, where the saturation enthalpy values are 268.38, 269.23, and 285.57 kilojoules per kilogram.

The mass flow rate equals 2.8 kilojoules per second divided by the difference between 268.38 kilojoules per kilogram and 261.15 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 1.2099 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilojoules per kilogram per second.
