1. Left-hand side; stationary implies that the heat output rate, denoted as Q dot out, equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference in enthalpy between the outlet and the inlet minus the heat rate Q_R.

The enthalpy at the outlet, at 200 degrees Celsius and quality x equals 0, is 919.09 kilojoules per kilogram, as taken from table A-2.

The enthalpy at the inlet, at 70 degrees Celsius and quality x equals 0, is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram, also from table A-2.

The heat output rate, Q dot out, is calculated as 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference in enthalpy (919.09 minus 292.98), which initially gives 3.78 kilowatts, but then corrected to negative 62.182 kilowatts.
