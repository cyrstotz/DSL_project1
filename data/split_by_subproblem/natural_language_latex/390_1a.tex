1. In the reaction area, consider the first main equation, neglecting kinetic and potential energy:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance, plus the heat transfer rate into the system, minus the heat transfer rate out of the system, minus the power output.

The heat transfer rate out of the system is equal to the mass flow rate entering times the difference between the enthalpy entering and the enthalpy at the exit, plus the heat transfer rate due to radiation.
This equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 2925.92 kilojoules per kilogram and 417.04 kilojoules per kilogram, plus 100 kilojoules per second.
This results in 62,782 kilojoules per second, which is equal to 62,782 kilowatts.

From Table A-2:
The enthalpy of the entering fluid at 700 degrees Celsius and boiling condition is equal to the fluid enthalpy at 700 degrees Celsius, which is 2925.92 kilojoules per kilogram.
The enthalpy at the exit at 700 degrees Celsius is equal to the fluid enthalpy at 700 degrees Celsius, which is 417.04 kilojoules per kilogram.
