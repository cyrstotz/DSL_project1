The ratio of T6 to T5 is equal to the ratio of P6 to P5 raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.

T6 equals 7 times 43.19 times the ratio of 0.15 to 0.5 raised to the power of 0.9 divided by 1.4, which equals 328.07 Kelvin.

Omega equals A times the rate of change of volume V, leading to the ratio of the rate of change of volume at state 5 to state 6 being equal to the ratio of omega at state 5 to omega at state 6.

The ratio of T6 to T5 is equal to the ratio of omega5 to omega6 raised to the power of n minus 1.

This leads to omega6 being equal to omega5 times the ratio of T5 to T6 raised to the power of 1 divided by (n minus 1), which equals 437.486 meters per second.
