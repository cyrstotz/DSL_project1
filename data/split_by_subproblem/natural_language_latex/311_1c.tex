The rate of entropy production, denoted as S dot subscript "er", is equal to the rate of heat output, Q dot subscript "aus", divided by the reactor temperature, T subscript "Reaktor", plus the rate of heat output, Q dot subscript "aus", divided by the average temperature, T bar.

This equals negative the rate of heat output, Q dot subscript "aus", divided by the reactor temperature, T subscript "Reaktor", plus the rate of heat output, Q dot subscript "aus", divided by the average temperature, T bar, which equals 46.146 kilojoules per Kelvin.
