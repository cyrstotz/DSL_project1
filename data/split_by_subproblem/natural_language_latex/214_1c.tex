The entropy balance 2 is given by the equation:
U dot equals m dot subscript out times the quantity S subscript in minus S subscript out, plus Q dot subscript out divided by T, plus S dot subscript generated.

S subscript in equals (the equation is not completed here).

For task 1, the equation is simply phi.
