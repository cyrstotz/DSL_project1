The text describes a graph related to coolant (KÃ¼hlmittel). The graph is a simple Cartesian coordinate system with the horizontal axis labeled as "T" for temperature and the vertical axis labeled as "P" for pressure. Both axes have arrows pointing in the positive direction, and the origin is at the bottom left corner where the two axes intersect.
