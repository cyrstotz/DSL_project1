Exergy balance, state FD:

The exergy rate of the process is equal to the external exergy rate plus the product of one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the temperature at state B, multiplied by the ratio of the heat transfer rate at state B to the mass flow rate of the process.

This is calculated as one hundred kilojoules per kilogram plus the product of one minus the ratio of two hundred ninety-three point one five Kelvin to seventy-two point six five Kelvin, multiplied by the ratio of one thousand four hundred fifty-five kilojoules per second to six point two five kilograms per second.

The result is two hundred fifty-nine point zero two kilojoules per kilogram.
