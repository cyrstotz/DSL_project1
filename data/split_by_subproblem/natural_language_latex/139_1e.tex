The equations are as follows:

1. Delta s subscript 12 equals m dot times the difference of s subscript 2,e and s subscript 2,a, plus the sum of Q dot subscript i divided by T subscript i, minus the sum of Q dot subscript e divided by T subscript e.

2. Zero equals m dot times the difference of s subscript e and s subscript a, plus the sum of Q dot subscript i divided by T subscript i, plus S subscript generated, since both are equal.

3. Delta s subscript 12 equals m dot times the difference of s subscript 2,e and s subscript 2,a, plus the sum of Q dot subscript i divided by T subscript i, minus the sum of Q dot subscript e divided by T subscript e.
