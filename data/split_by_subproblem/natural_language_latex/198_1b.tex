The average temperature T_kF is equal to the integral from e to a of T times dS, divided by the difference S_a minus S_e. The difference S_a minus S_e equals negative C_p. The average temperature T_kF is then calculated as the sum of two times 258.15 Kelvin plus 293.15 Kelvin, all divided by two, which equals 293.15 Kelvin.

The average temperature T_Utk is 295 Kelvin.
