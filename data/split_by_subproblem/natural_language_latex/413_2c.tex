Problem c:

Given: The change in exergy, denoted as Delta ex_str, is the difference between ex_6 and ex_0.

Exergy of a flowing friction:
The exergy at state 6, ex_6, is given by the formula:
ex_6 equals h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus half of w_6 squared,
where w_6 equals 50 meters per second, and T_0 equals 293.15 Kelvin.

The exergy at state 0, ex_0, is given by:
ex_0 equals half of w_0 squared,
and all other terms are zero since h_0 and s_0 are independent of temperature.

The change in enthalpy from state 0 to state 6 is:
h_6 minus h_0 equals c_p times (T_6 minus T_0) equals 85.134 kilojoules per kilogram.

The change in entropy from state 0 to state 6 is:
s_6 minus s_0 equals c_p times the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0) minus R times the natural logarithm of (P_6 divided by P_0) equals 0.30196 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, since P_6 equals P_0.

Therefore, ex_6 equals 85.134 kilojoules per kilogram minus 293.15 Kelvin times 0.30196 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin plus half of (50 meters per second squared) equals 345 kilojoules per kilogram.

ex_0 equals 20 kilojoules per kilogram.

The change in exergy, Delta ex, equals 325 kilojoules per kilogram.
