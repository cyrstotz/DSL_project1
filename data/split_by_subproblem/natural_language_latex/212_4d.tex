d) The epsilon_c is equal to the ratio of Q dot 2u over Q dot AB1 minus Q dot 2u, which is equal to the ratio of Q dot k over Q dot AB1 minus Q dot k, which equals 0.02.

The equation Q dot k minus Q dot AB plus W dot k equals zero implies that Q dot k equals Q dot AB minus W dot k, which equals 0.652 kilowatts.

The equation zero equals m dot times (h3 minus h4) plus Q dot AB implies that Q dot AB equals 28.652 kilowatts.

h4 equals h evaluated at x4 equals zero and p4 equals 8 bar, which equals 264.15.
