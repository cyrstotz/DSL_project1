With T equals 298 Kelvin,
zero equals m dot times the difference of S_e and S_a plus Q dot r divided by T plus S dot of S_e.
For S_a+ equals m dot times the difference of S_a and S_e minus Q dot r divided by T, leading to S_a+ minus Q dot r divided by T minus 37.7 divided by 298 Kelvin equals 127.8 Joules per Kelvin.
Q dot r equals 37.7 kiloJoules per kilogram.
S_a equals
