Underlined: Exergy balance of a stationary flow process:

The equation is zero equals mass flow rate times negative change in internal exergy plus the term (one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the temperature) times the heat transfer rate minus the input exergy flow rate minus the input exergy, net zero.

The internal exergy at input one equals negative change in internal exergy plus (one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to itself) times the heat of combustion.

This simplifies to negative 100 watts per microgram plus (one minus the ratio of 243 Kelvin to 1288 Kelvin) times 1.195 watts per microgram.

The internal exergy at input one equals 869.72 watts per microgram.
