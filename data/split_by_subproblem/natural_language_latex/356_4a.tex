The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled P with the unit mbar and ranges from 0 to 10. The horizontal axis is labeled T with the unit degrees Celsius and ranges from 0 to an unspecified value. The graph contains the following elements:
- A horizontal dashed line at P equals 10 mbar.
- A vertical dashed line at T equals 0 degrees Celsius.
- A point labeled (i) at the intersection of P equals 10 mbar and T equals 0 degrees Celsius.
- A point labeled (ii) at P equals 2 mbar and T equals 0 degrees Celsius.
- A point labeled (iii) at P equals 3 mbar and T equals 0 degrees Celsius.
- A horizontal line labeled "isotherm" at P equals 3 mbar.
- A vertical line labeled "isobar" at T equals 0 degrees Celsius.
- A point labeled "triple point" at the intersection of the isotherm and isobar lines.
- The region to the left of the isobar is labeled "Ice".
- The region to the right of the isobar is labeled "Water".
- The region above the isotherm is labeled "Gas".
