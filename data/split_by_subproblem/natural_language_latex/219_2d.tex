The second equation of state is given by:
0 equals s subscript 6 minus s subscript alpha plus a canceled term 'c, adiab' plus s subscript omega z. This equals s subscript e z, which equals Delta s subscript 0 6, which equals c subscript p, luft times the natural logarithm of T subscript 6 over T subscript 0 minus R times the natural logarithm of p subscript 6 over p subscript 0. This results in 0.3014 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The exergy velocity is given by:
e subscript x, vel equals T subscript 0 times s subscript e z, which equals 73.276 kilojoules per kilogram.

Description of the graph:
The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as s and the y-axis labeled as T. There are two curves on the graph. The first curve starts at the origin (0,0), rises steeply, and then levels off. The second curve starts at the same point but rises more gradually and then also levels off. The first curve is labeled with a point 1 at the start, a point 2 at the peak, and a point 3 where it levels off. The second curve is not labeled.
