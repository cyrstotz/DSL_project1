Negative change in the rate of exergy, denoted as delta dot E subscript xstr, equals the initial rate of exergy, dot E subscript xstr,0, minus the final rate of exergy, dot E subscript xstr,e.

The mass flow rate, dot m, times the expression h subscript 0 minus h subscript e minus T subscript 0 times the difference in entropy s subscript 0 minus s subscript e plus delta ke.

Negative rate of exergy, dot e subscript xstr, equals h subscript 0 minus h subscript e minus T subscript 0 times the difference in entropy s subscript 0 minus s subscript e.

This equals C subscript p times the difference in temperature T subscript 0 minus T subscript e minus T subscript 0 times the quantity natural log of T subscript 0 over T subscript e minus R times the natural log of p subscript 0 over p subscript e plus the difference in the squares of W subscript 0 and W subscript e divided by 2.

This further simplifies to negative 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram times the difference in temperatures 297.15 Kelvin minus 328.1 Kelvin minus 293.15 Kelvin times the natural log of the ratio 297.15 Kelvin over 328.1 Kelvin minus 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram times the natural log of 1.

Plus the difference in the squares of 200 meters squared per second squared and 329 meters squared per second squared divided by 2.

A line is drawn for separation.

The rate of exergy, dot e subscript xstr, equals 119.5 kilojoules per kilogram.
