Zero equals the mass flow rate at the inlet times the difference in entropy between the inlet and outlet states subscript m minus the heat flow rate out divided by the temperature at the condensation point plus the entropy flow rate into the system.

The entropy at the inlet, denoted as s_e, at 70 degrees Celsius is 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy at the outlet, denoted as s_a, at 100 degrees Celsius is 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy flow rate into the system, denoted as dot S subscript ez, equals negative the mass flow rate at the inlet times the difference in entropy between the inlet and outlet plus the heat flow rate out divided by the temperature at the condensation point.

This results in 0.3177 kilojoules per Kelvin second.
