c) The temperature \( T_{s2} \) is equal to 0.003 degrees Celsius.

1. First Law of Thermodynamics:
The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is equal to the heat added \( Q_{12} \).

This implies that the mass \( m \) times the difference in specific internal energy \( (u_2 - u_1) \) equals \( Q_{12} \), and the difference in specific internal energy \( (u_2 - u_1) \) is equal to the specific heat at constant volume \( c_v \) times the temperature difference \( (T_2 - T_1) \).

This further implies that \( Q_{12} \) equals the mass of gas \( m_G \) times the specific heat at constant volume \( c_v \) times the temperature difference \( (T_2 - T_1) \), which equals negative 1.08 kilojoules.
