The mass flow rate of H, denoted as m-dot subscript H, equals 5.279 times the mass flow rate of K, denoted as m-dot subscript K.

The total mass flow rate, denoted as m-dot subscript ges, is the sum of the mass flow rate of H and the mass flow rate of K.

The equation zero equals the sum of m-dot times m-dot is given.

The kinetic energy loss, denoted as e subscript k, comma verlust, equals the product of T subscript zero and the entropy loss rate, denoted as s-dot subscript verlust.

The total entropy rate, denoted as S-dot subscript ges, is mentioned in the context of the combustion chamber, turbine, mixing chamber, and compressor.

In the graphical content description, a diagram in part (d) illustrates a control volume with four arrows indicating mass flow rates. The arrows are labeled as follows:
- The arrow entering from the left is labeled as m-dot subscript H.
- The arrow entering from the right is labeled as m-dot subscript K.
- The arrow exiting from the top is labeled as m-dot subscript H.
- The arrow exiting from the bottom is labeled as m-dot subscript K.

The control volume is also labeled with W subscript K and m-dot subscript verdichteter.
