The rate of entropy generation, denoted as s-dot with subscript "erf", is equal to the mass flow rate, m-dot, times the difference between the entropy at the outlet, s with subscript "aus", and the entropy at the inlet, s with subscript "ein", minus the ratio of the heat transfer rate, Q-dot with subscript "R", to the temperature, T with subscript "Reborn", plus the ratio of the heat transfer rate, Q-dot with subscript "aus", to the temperature, T with subscript "AF".

This is mathematically represented as:
s-dot with subscript "erf" equals m-dot times (s with subscript "aus" minus s with subscript "ein") minus (Q-dot with subscript "R" divided by T with subscript "Reborn") plus (Q-dot with subscript "aus" divided by T with subscript "AF").

Substituting the values, it becomes:
0.3 times (7.3064 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 0.9464 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) minus (100 kilowatts divided by 372.75 Kelvin) plus (62.182 kilowatts divided by 295 Kelvin).

This simplifies to:
0.0694 kilojoules per Kelvin.
