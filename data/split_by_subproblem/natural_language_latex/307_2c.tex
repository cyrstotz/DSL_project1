T6 equals 340 Kelvin; w6 equals 510 meters per second; T0 equals 243.15 Kelvin.

The change in exergy, denoted as Delta ex,st, is calculated as ex,st,6 minus ex,st,0.

The exergy at state 6, ex,st,6, is given by the mass flow rate times the expression (h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0) plus one half times w6 squared).

This simplifies to the specific heat at constant pressure for ideal gas air (cp^ig,luft) times (T6 minus T0) minus T0 times (the specific heat at constant pressure for ideal gas air times the natural logarithm of (T6 divided by T0) minus the gas constant R times the natural logarithm of (p6 divided by p0)) plus one half times w6 squared.

The mass flow rate of air, dot m_luft, is 28.3 kilograms per kilomole; R, the specific gas constant, is 0.2869 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Thus, ex,st,6 equals the mass flow rate times 130 kilojoules per kilogram.

The exergy at state 0, ex,st,0, is calculated as (h0 minus h0 minus T0 times (s0 minus s0) plus one half times w0 squared) which equals 40 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, the change in exergy, Delta ex,st, equals 90 kilojoules per kilogram.
