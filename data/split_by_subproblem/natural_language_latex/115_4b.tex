The graph has a vertical axis labeled "p" and a horizontal axis labeled "T". There is a curve starting from the origin, moving upwards and to the right, then bending downwards and to the right. The curve intersects a horizontal line labeled "1000m, i". There is a vertical line segment labeled "Ice" intersecting the curve at a point labeled "2000m". The curve continues to the right and slightly downwards, ending at a point labeled "D".

Solidification, saturation damping with a linear heat transfer. The equation is Q_in equals the fraction of m dot times the difference between h_in and h_aus, all over m dot.
