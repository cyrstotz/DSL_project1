The change in energy, denoted as Delta E, is equal to the sum of the mass flow rate of component i, denoted as m-dot subscript i, times the sum of the enthalpy of component i, denoted as h subscript i, plus one half times the square of the velocity of component i, denoted as v subscript i squared, plus the product of the gravitational constant g and the height of component i, denoted as z subscript i, plus the sum of the heat transfer Q subscript i.
