The temperature \( T_{g,12} \) equals 0.003 degrees Celsius, which is 273.153 Kelvin, and the volume \( V_{g,12} \) equals (value not provided).

The term "Menge" translates to "Amount" or "Quantity".

The change in energy from state 1 to state 2 is given by \( E_2 - E_1 \), which equals the heat added \( Q_{12} \) minus the work done \( W_{v,12} \).

The mass of the working fluid times the change in internal energy \( m_{EW} (U_2 - U_1) \) equals the heat added \( Q_{12} \).

The internal energy at state 2, \( U_2 \), is calculated by reading \( U_{F,2} \) plus \( X_2 \) times the difference between \( U_{gr} \) and \( U_{F,2} \).

The internal energy at state 1, \( U_1 \), is calculated by reading \( U_{F,1} \) plus \( X_1 \) times the difference between \( U_{gr} \) and \( U_{F,1} \).
