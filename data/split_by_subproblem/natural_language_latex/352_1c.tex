c)

The derivative of S dot with respect to time equals the sum of m dot times s plus the sum of Q dot over T plus S dot generated.

Zero equals m dot times (s at KF, in minus s at KF, out) plus Q dot out over T at KF plus S dot generated.

S dot generated equals m dot at KF times (s at KF, out minus s at KF, in) minus Q out over T at KF.

Ideal fluid.

Therefore, s out minus s in equals the integral from T in to T out of c over T dT.

Entropy balance around reactor:

S dot equals the sum of m dot times s plus Q dot over T plus S dot generated.

Zero equals m dot times (s in minus s out) plus Q dot generated over T at HF plus S dot generated.

S dot generated equals Q dot generated over T at HF plus m dot times (s out minus s in).

s out equals s at 100 degrees Celsius, reduced fluid equals s at 100 degrees Celsius, 0.04 bar equals 1.3062 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

s in equals s at 30 degrees Celsius, reduced fluid equals s at 30 degrees Celsius, 0.315 bar equals 0.2549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Therefore, S dot generated times 22.4 kilojoules per Kelvin.
