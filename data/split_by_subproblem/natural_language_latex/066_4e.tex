The graph description is as follows: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as P and the horizontal axis labeled as T. The graph displays a curve that begins at the origin and ascends upwards to the right. A point is marked on the curve, and a vertical line is drawn from this point upwards. The curve appears to be non-linear, suggesting a possible exponential or logarithmic relationship between P and T.
