For the section titled "Stationary Flow Process":

The equation is:
The rate of external power for the compressor, denoted as P dot subscript ex,ver, equals the change in exergy efficiency in the actual process, denoted as Delta e subscript ex,ist, plus the change in exergy efficiency in the ideal process, denoted as Delta e subscript ex,iq, minus the ratio of turbine work rate, denoted as W dot subscript t, to the mass flow rate of steam, denoted as m dot subscript s, approaches zero, since the total power of the turbine goes into the compressor!

The exergy efficiency in the ideal process, denoted as e subscript ex,iq, equals one minus the ratio of the reference temperature, T subscript 0, to the temperature at point B, T subscript B, times the heat of combustion at B, q subscript B, which equals 969.58 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy for the compressor, denoted as e subscript in,ver, equals 1710.38 kilojoules per kilogram.
