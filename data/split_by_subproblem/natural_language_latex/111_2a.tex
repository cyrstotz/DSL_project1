The expression is T[K].

The graph description is as follows: The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled S[J/kgÂ·K] and the y-axis labeled T[K]. The plot contains several curves and lines:
- There are two horizontal dashed lines labeled T equals T3 and T equals T1.
- There are three vertical dashed lines labeled S1, S2, and S3.
- There is a solid curve starting from the origin, rising steeply, and then leveling off.
- Another solid curve starts from the end of the first curve, rises steeply again, and then levels off.
- The curves are connected by vertical lines, forming a closed loop.
- The region enclosed by the curves and lines is shaded.
- The term "Isobar" is written near the top right of the graph.
- The term "v_n c" is written near the middle right of the graph.
