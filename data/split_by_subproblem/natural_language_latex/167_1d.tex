The equations provided are as follows:

1. Q equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times the difference in enthalpy (h1 minus h2) plus Qs.

2. The mass flow rate for the reactor times the enthalpy at a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius equals the mass flow rate at 2 times the enthalpy at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius minus the product of the mass generation rate and the mass flow rate at 2 times the enthalpy at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius.

3. This simplifies to the mass generation rate times the enthalpy at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius minus the mass generation rate times the enthalpy at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius equals the mass generation rate times the enthalpy at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius minus the mass generation rate times the enthalpy at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius.

4. This further simplifies to the mass flow rate at 2 equals the mass generation rate times the difference in enthalpy at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius over the difference in enthalpy at temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius and 70 degrees Celsius, which equals 2765.08 kilograms.

For the second part:

1. The change in entropy (Delta S) equals the product of m12 and s12 at 100 degrees Celsius over the product of m12 and the difference in s12 minus s12, plus the sum from i equals 1 to 2 and j equals 1 to 0 of Qij over Tij minus S12.

2. This simplifies to m12 minus m12 times s12 at 70 degrees Celsius over T minus m12 squared times 200 degrees Celsius over T minus m12 times the change in m12 times 150 degrees Celsius over T equals 263.07 kilograms.

3. The change in time (Delta t) equals negative 600.6647 times S12.
