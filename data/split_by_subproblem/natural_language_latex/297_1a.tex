Energy balance (stationary):
The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat flow rate at the outlet. This implies that the heat flow rate at the outlet equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet.

The enthalpy at the inlet, denoted as h_ein, at 70 degrees Celsius is 252.58 kilojoules per kilogram. The enthalpy at the outlet, denoted as h_aus, at 40 degrees Celsius is 418.09 kilojoules per kilogram. The heat flow rate at the outlet, denoted as Q_aus, equals negative the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, which equals 37.82 kilowatts.
