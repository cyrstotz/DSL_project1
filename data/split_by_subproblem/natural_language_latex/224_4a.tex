Graph 1: A p-T diagram with a dome-shaped curve representing the phase boundary. The x-axis is labeled T and the y-axis is labeled p. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked on the diagram, with arrows indicating transitions between these points.

Graph 2: A p-T diagram with a rectangular path. The x-axis is labeled T and the y-axis is labeled p. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked on the diagram. The path goes from point 1 to point 2 horizontally, then vertically to point 3, horizontally to point 4, and vertically back to point 1. The regions are labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "gaseous." The triple point is also marked.
