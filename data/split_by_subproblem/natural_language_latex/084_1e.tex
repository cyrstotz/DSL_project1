The change in entropy between state 1 and state 2 is given by the formula:

Delta S_12 equals Delta m_12 times the difference (s_2 minus s_1).

Substituting the values, we have:

3000 kilograms times (0.9889 minus 1.33744) equals negative 1.253 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Here, s_2 is the entropy at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 0.9889.

s_1 is the entropy at 20 degrees Celsius, which is 1.33744.
