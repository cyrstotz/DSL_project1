The graph is described as a pressure-temperature diagram, with the x-axis labeled as T for temperature and the y-axis labeled as p for pressure. It features three distinct regions labeled as "Solid", "Liquid + Gas", and "Gas". The "Solid" region is located on the left side, the "Gas" region on the right side, and the "Liquid + Gas" region in the middle. The graph displays a curve that begins in the "Solid" region, passes through the "Liquid + Gas" region, and concludes in the "Gas" region. There are three points marked on the graph as z, 1, and 3. Point z is situated in the "Solid" region, point 1 in the "Liquid + Gas" region, and point 3 in the "Gas" region. A vertical line connects point z to point 3, and a horizontal line connects point 1 to point 3. These lines are highlighted in red color.
