The pressure \( p_{g1,2} \) should remain constant, since \( p_0 \) does not change and the mass from above remains constant.

The value of \( p_{g1,2} \) is 1.44 bar.

Regarding \( T_{g1,2} \): The water essentially absorbs the same amount of energy as the gas absorbs for a fixed temperature difference. This means that the effect on the gas is offset by the water in reverse. Therefore, \( T_{g1,2} \) equals 0.0038.
