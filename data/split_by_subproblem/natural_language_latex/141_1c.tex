The entropy departure for a closed system is represented by S-dot-subscript-e. The equation is given as:
S-dot-subscript-e equals m-dot times the difference between s2 and s1, which equals Q-dot-subscript-R divided by T plus S-dot-subscript-e.
Simplifying, we get:
S-dot-subscript-e equals m-dot times the difference between s2 and s1 minus Q-dot-subscript-R divided by T.
