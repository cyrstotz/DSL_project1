Subsection e)

Change in entropy, Delta S, for a closed system is given by:

Delta S equals m2 times s2 minus m1 times s1, which equals Delta m sub x2 times s sub ein plus the sum of Q sub i divided by T.

Rearranging, Delta S equals m2 times s2 minus m1 times s1, which implies (m1 plus Delta m sub x2) times s2 minus m1 times s1.

Here, s2 is the entropy at 70 degrees Celsius for the boiling fluid, and s1 is the entropy at 100 degrees Celsius for the boiling fluid.

Finally, Delta S equals (5755 plus 3465.4) times (0.954 kJ/kg K) minus 5755 times (1.306 kJ/kg K).
