The equations are as follows:
- The rate of change of energy in terms of velocity, denoted as E dot subscript x comma vel, equals T zero times the rate of change of entropy at e,17, denoted as S dot subscript e comma 17.
- The rate of change of mechanical energy, denoted as E dot subscript x comma mech, equals T zero times the rate of change of entropy at e,me, denoted as S dot subscript e comma me, all divided by the rate of mass flow at 0.5, denoted as m dot subscript zero comma five.
