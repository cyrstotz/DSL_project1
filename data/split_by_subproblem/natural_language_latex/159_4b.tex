Negative rate of change of kinetic energy, denoted as negative W dot subscript K, equals the mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, times the difference between h subscript 2 and h subscript 3.

h subscript 2 for A equals 11 is equal to h subscript g at 2 bar, which is 249.3 kilojoules per kilogram.

h subscript 3 for A equals 11 is equal to h subscript f of h subscript g at 8 bar, which is 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram.

The mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, equals negative W dot subscript K divided by the difference between 249.3 kilojoules per kilogram and 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram, which results in 1.223 kilograms per second.

h subscript Q equals h subscript 1 equals h subscript (Sow) equals 9,942.

x equals the fraction where the numerator is h subscript 1 minus h subscript f, and the denominator is h subscript fg minus h subscript f.
