- A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as S with units in kilograms per kilogram Kelvin.
- The y-axis is labeled as T with units in Kelvin.
- The graph consists of a curve that starts at point 1 on the y-axis, moves up to point 2, then to point 3, down to point 4, and finally up to point 5 on the y-axis.
- Points 1 and 5 are on the y-axis, with point 1 at the bottom and point 5 at the top.
- The curve between points 2 and 3 is labeled as "isobar (passes through 3)" and the curve between points 4 and 5 is labeled as "isobar".
- The curve between points 3 and 4 is also labeled as "isobar".
