Entropy balance at the reactor:

Q equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times the difference between the entropy at exit state 2 and the entropy at entry state 1, plus the heat transfer rate (Q dot) divided by the temperature T, plus the generated entropy (S_erz).

This equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times the difference between the entropy at entry (S_ein) and the entropy at exit (S_aus), plus the heat transfer rate at exit (Q dot_aus) divided by the cooling water temperature (T_KW), plus the generated entropy (S_erz).

The generated entropy (S_erz) equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times the difference between the entropy at exit (S_aus) and the entropy at entry (S_ein), plus the heat transfer at exit (Q_aus) divided by the cooling water temperature (T_KW), which equals 0.317 kilowatts, and this is equal to the generated entropy (S_erz).

The entropy at exit (S_aus) equals the exit quality (x_aus) times the entropy of gas (S_g) plus one minus the exit quality (1 - x_aus) times the entropy of fluid (S_f), from Table A-2.

This equals 1.33714 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy at entry (S_ein) equals the entry quality (x_ein) times the entropy of gas (S_g) plus one minus the entry quality (1 - x_ein) times the entropy of fluid (S_f), from Table A-2.

This equals 0.888902 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
