The content describes a graph of T[K] versus s. The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as s in units of kJ/kgK and the y-axis labeled as T in units of Kelvin. The graph consists of six points labeled 1 through 6. Point 1 is located at the bottom left, point 2 is directly above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, point 4 is above point 3, point 5 is to the right of point 4, and point 6 is below point 5. These points are connected by a curve in the sequence from point 1 to point 6. There is a label "Isobar" positioned between points 3 and 4.
