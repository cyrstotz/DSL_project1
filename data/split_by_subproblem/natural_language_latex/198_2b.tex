- T0, T6
- Energy balance:

The equation is zero equals m dot five times the quantity h5 minus h6 plus half the difference of w5 squared minus w6 squared, plus Q dot plus m dot zero.

h5 minus h6 equals Cp times the difference T5 minus T6.

For T6:

T6 equals T5 times the ratio of 0.1594 bar to 0.5 bar raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.

T6 equals 423.94 Kelvin times the ratio of 0.159 to 0.5 raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 equals 328.075 Kelvin.

w0 equals negative the square root of w5 squared plus two times the quantity h5 minus h6.

The length l06 equals the square root of 220 kg per second squared plus two times 4 kg per second times 1.006 kg per kgK times the difference 337.94 minus 328.0254, which equals 507.243 meters per second.
