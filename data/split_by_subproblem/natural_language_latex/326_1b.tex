The inverse of the average temperature T_KF is equal to the integral of dQ_s over s_a minus s_e, divided by s_a minus s_e, which equals q_rev over s_a minus s_e, which equals the integral from T_1 to T_2 of c_p over T dT plus v squared times (p_2 minus p_1 over p_2 minus p_1), all over the integral from T_1 to T_2 of c_p over T dT.

The average temperature T_KF equals the exponential of (T_2 minus T_1) over the natural logarithm of (T_2 over T_1), which simplifies to (T_2 minus T_1) over the natural logarithm of (T_2 over T_1).

The average temperature T_KF equals 298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin over the natural logarithm of (288.15 over 298.15), which simplifies to 10 over the natural logarithm of (h_aus over h_ein), resulting in 293.12 Kelvin.
