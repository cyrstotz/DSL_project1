The content includes several mathematical expressions:

1. The terms \( u_{(a)}^{(s)} \) and \( u_{(k)}^{(k)} \), followed by the scalar \( 2t \) and the temperature \( 2000^\circ C \).

2. An equation involving volumes and heat transfer:
   \[
   V_{2, \text{RW}} - V_{2, \text{FW}} = -Q_{12} = m_{(k+1)} \left( x_2 u_L + (1 - x_2) u_S \right) - \left( x_1 u_L + (1 - x_1) u_S \right)
   \]
   This states that the difference between the volume at RW and FW equals negative \( Q_{12} \), which is further equated to a mass times a linear combination of \( u_L \) and \( u_S \) for states \( x_2 \) and \( x_1 \).

3. A rearranged form of the previous equation to solve for \( x_2 \):
   \[
   -\frac{Q_{12}}{m_{(k+1)}} = x_2 (u_L - u_S) + u_S^k - (x_1 (u_L - u_S) + u_S^k)
   \]
   Simplified to:
   \[
   = (x_2 - x_1) (u_L - u_S)
   \]

4. The final expression to find \( x_2 \):
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{-Q_{12}}{m_{(k+1)} (u_L - u_S)} + x_1 = 0.574
   \]
   This shows \( x_2 \) as a function of \( Q_{12} \), \( m_{(k+1)} \), \( u_L \), \( u_S \), and \( x_1 \), and states that \( x_2 \) equals 0.574.
