The extended exergy rate, denoted as E-dot with subscript x,verl, equals T-zero multiplied by the rate of entropy generation, S-dot with subscript ez.

The rate of entropy generation, S-dot with subscript ez, equals the mass flow rate, m-dot, times the difference in entropy between state 2 and state 1, which is m-dot times the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature T2 to T1 multiplied by the specific heat at constant pressure, Cp.

The ratio of the extended exergy rate to the mass flow rate, E-dot with subscript x,verl divided by m-dot, equals T-zero times Cp times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T-zero to T-zero minus 293.15 Kelvin times 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 340 Kelvin to 293.15 Kelvin.

This results in 82.01 kilojoules per kilogram.
