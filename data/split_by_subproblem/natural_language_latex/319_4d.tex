The equation for \( E_k \) is given by the ratio of \( \dot{Q}_k \) to \( \dot{W}_k \), which is equal to \( \frac{\dot{Q}_k}{\dot{W}_k} \).

The expression for \( \dot{Q}_k \) is \( \dot{m} \times (h_2 - h_1) \).

Graph 3 is described as a plot with an x-axis and y-axis, featuring a curve that starts from the bottom left and ascends towards the top right. The curve is marked with a wavy line at the top and the graph is labeled with "(*)".
