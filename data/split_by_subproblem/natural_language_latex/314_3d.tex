The mass-energy balance equation is given by \( m_{ew} (u_2 - u_1) = l Q_{12} \) with a predetermined \( l \) (applicable among other conditions). 

The internal energy \( u_1 \) is calculated as \( 0.6 \times (-333.455 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}) + 0.4 \times (-0.65 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}) = -200.933 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}} \).

The internal energy \( u_2 \) is expressed as \( x_{Eis2} \times (-333.455 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}) + (1 - x_{Eis2}) \times (-0.65 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}) \).

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is \( 15 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}} \).

Substituting the values, \( u_2 \) is calculated as \( 15 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}} = 200.933 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}} - 185.693 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}} \).

Solving for \( x_{Eis2} \), \( -185.693 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}} = x_{Eis2} \times (-333.455 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}) \).

Finally, \( x_{Eis2} \) is found to be \( 0.555 \).
