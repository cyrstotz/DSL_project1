Energy Balance implies isentropic since it is reversible, hence Delta Q equals zero. The ratio n equals k equals the ratio of c_p over c_v, which is 1.4. The temperature T_0 equals T_s times the ratio of P_0 over P_s raised to the power of (n-1) over n, which results in 328.07 Kelvin.

Where: Energy balance around the thrust nozzle, stationary, one mass flow:
- P_e equals zero.

The equation zero equals m dot times (h_s minus h_e plus the difference of w_s squared minus w_e squared all over 2) plus Q dot from s to e minus W dot t, re.

Wiese: W dot t, re equals m dot times (h_s minus h_e).
