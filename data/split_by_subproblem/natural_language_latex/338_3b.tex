Required: \( T_{g2} \), \( p_{g2} \)

The pressure \( p_{g2} \) equals \( p_{g1} \) which is 1.4 bar, since the weight of the EW does not change.

The equation \( p_{2g} V_{2g} = m_2 R T_2 \) is given.

Calculating \( \frac{p_{2g} V_{2g}}{m_2 R} \) yields \( \frac{1.4 \, bar \cdot 3.14 \, L}{3.42 \, g \cdot 0.1663 \, \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}} = 7 \).
