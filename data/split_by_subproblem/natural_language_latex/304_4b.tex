Flow process around the compressor:
- The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 1 and state 3 plus the power input to the compressor equals zero.
- Therefore, the mass flow rate equals the power input to the compressor divided by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3.

Isenthalpic throttling:
- The enthalpy at state 4 equals the enthalpy at state 3.
- The pressure at state 3 equals the pressure at state 4.
- Therefore, the enthalpy at state 4 equals the enthalpy at state 3, which equals the enthalpy at the saturation state at 8 bar.
- This is equal to 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram, as found in Table A-11.
