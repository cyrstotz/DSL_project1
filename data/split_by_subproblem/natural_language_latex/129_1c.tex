The entropy generation rate, denoted as S_erz, is equal to the heat output rate, Q_out, divided by the temperature, T_KF. This is calculated as 62.15 kilojoules per second divided by 293.15 Kelvin, resulting in -212 Watts per Kelvin.

The equation involving M1, Delta M12, U2, U1, hf at 20 degrees Celsius, and Q_11,12 is given by:
(M1 plus Delta M12) times U2 minus M1 times U1 equals Delta M12 times hf at 20 degrees Celsius minus Q_11,12.

The internal energy U2 is calculated as 293.55 plus 0.005 times (2646.6 minus 252.95), resulting in 303.85 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy U1, labeled as TA-2, is calculated as 4 times (1.54 plus 0.005 times (2506.7 minus 419.54)), resulting in 493.55 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy hf at 20 degrees Celsius is 83.56 kilojoules per kilogram.

The equation involving M1, U1, Delta m12, m1, U2, Delta m, h, and Q_out is given by:
M1 times U1 plus Delta m12 minus m1 times U2 equals Delta m times h minus Q_out.

The equation involving 4 pi, h2, h1, m1, U1, Q_in, and m1 U1 is given by:
4 pi times (h2 minus h1) equals m1 times U1 minus Q_in minus m1 times U1.

The equation involving M1, U1, Q_in, m1, U2, and the mass flow rate is given by:
M1 times U1 minus Q_in minus m1 times U2 equals 57.55 kilograms per second times (493.33 minus 303.33) kilojoules per kilogram minus 55000 kilojoules per second.

Delta m12 is calculated as U2 minus hw divided by (493.33 minus 83.56) kilojoules per kilogram.

4 pi12 equals 3127 kilograms per second.
