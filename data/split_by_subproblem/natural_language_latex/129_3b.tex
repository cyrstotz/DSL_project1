b) T-bar subscript 2, P subscript 2

P subscript 2 must equal P subscript 1 because the force/pressure equilibrium always occupies the same.

P subscript S2 equals 1.401 bar.

If X subscript S2 is greater than 0, then the temperature of EV must still be at 0 degrees Celsius.

Since at state 2, Q subscript ab equals 0, T subscript S2 must also remain at 0 degrees Celsius.
