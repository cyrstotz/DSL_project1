c) What is the generated entropy rate, denoted as S_dot_erz?

The equation is:
0 equals the mass flow rate, m_dot, times the difference in entropy at exit and at entry, s_e minus s_a, plus the sum of the heat transfer rate, Q_dot_j, divided by the temperature, T_j, at which the heat transfer occurs, plus the generated entropy rate, S_dot_erz.

Rearranging the equation, the generated entropy rate, S_dot_erz, equals the mass flow rate, m_dot, times the difference in entropy at entry and at exit, s_a minus s_e, minus the sum of the heat transfer rate, Q_dot_j, divided by the temperature, T_j.

Substituting the values, the generated entropy rate, S_dot_erz, equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference in entropy values, 1.3000 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, minus the sum of the heat transfer rates, 62.182 kilowatts plus 100 kilowatts, divided by the temperature, 293.12 Kelvin.

This results in a generated entropy rate of negative 0.0234 kilojoules per Kelvin second.

The entropy values for s_a and s_e are taken from Table A2.
