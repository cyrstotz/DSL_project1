R equals the ratio of R bar over M, which equals the fraction of 8.314 over 166.28 grams per kilogram Kelvin, resulting in 2 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.

m equals m sub K plus m sub EW, which equals 39.1 kilograms.

p sub g,1 equals p sub EW,1 equals p sub 0 times m times b plus the fraction of m times g over pi times the square of (d sub 2 divided by 2), resulting in 1.40 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals.

rho times V equals m times R times T.

m equals the fraction of p times V over R times T, which equals the fraction of 1.4 bar times 3.74 liters over 166.28 Joules per kilogram Kelvin times 500 degrees Celsius, resulting in 3.48 kilograms.
