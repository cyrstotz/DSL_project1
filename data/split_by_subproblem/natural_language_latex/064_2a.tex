A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled S and the y-axis labeled T (in K). There are several points and lines on the graph:
- Point 1 is located on the left side of the graph.
- Point 2 is above point 1.
- Point 3 is to the right of point 2.
- Point 4 is to the right of point 3.
- Point 5 is below point 4 and to the right of point 1.
- Point 6 is to the right of point 5.
Arrows indicate transitions between points: from point 1 to point 2, from point 2 to point 3, from point 3 to point 4, from point 4 to point 5, and from point 5 to point 6.
There is a label T_S near point 5.
There is a label S near the bottom right corner of the graph.
