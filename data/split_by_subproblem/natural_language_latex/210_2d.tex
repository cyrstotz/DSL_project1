The extended exergy, denoted as e_{x,verl}, is equal to the sum of the change in structural exergy, denoted as Delta e_{x,str}, and the term (dot{E}_x Q) divided by (dot{m}), which simplifies to e_{x,q}.

The value of e_{x,q} in the combustion chamber is calculated as follows:
e_{x,q} equals the product of (1 minus the ratio of 243.15 Kelvin to 1289 Kelvin) and 9 B (where B is likely a unit or constant).

This calculation results in e_{x,q} being equal to 969.58 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, the extended exergy, e_{x,verl}, is calculated by adding 100 kilojoules per kilogram to 969.58 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in a total of 1069.58 kilojoules per kilogram.
