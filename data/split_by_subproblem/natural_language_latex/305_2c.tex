Delta ex, s12 equals h2 minus h0 minus T0 times (s2 minus s0) plus half of w2 squared minus half of w0 squared. This equals cp times (T2 minus T0) minus T0 times (cp times the natural logarithm of T2 over T0) minus R times the natural logarithm of p2 over p0 plus half of w2 squared minus half of w0 squared. This further equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (328.07 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin) minus 243.15 Kelvin times (1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the natural logarithm of 328.07 Kelvin over 243.15 Kelvin) plus half of (56.72 meters per second squared) minus half of (220 meters per second squared). This results in 12.16 kilojoules plus 128.55 kilojoules minus 24.26 kilojoules, which equals 116.6 kilojoules underlined.
