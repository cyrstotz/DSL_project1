The energy efficiency \( E_K \) is calculated as the absolute value of the heat input \( \dot{Q}_{zu} \) minus the absolute value of the heat output \( \dot{Q}_{ab} \), divided by the absolute value of the work \( \dot{W}_{K} \). This results in \( E_K = \frac{\dot{m}_a (h_2 - h_1)}{28 \, \omega} \). Here, \( h_2 \) is the enthalpy at minus 22 degrees Celsius, which equals 234.08 kilojoules per kilogram.

Then, the heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{K} \) is calculated as \( \dot{Q}_{K} = \frac{4 \, \text{kg/h}}{3600 \, \text{s/h}} \left( 234.08 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \right) \), which simplifies to 0.1562 omega.

Finally, substituting back into the equation for \( E_K \), we get \( E_K = \frac{0.1562 \, \omega}{28 \, \omega} = 5.578 \).
