Energy balance on half open system:
The change in energy, Delta E, equals the mass flow rate of EVW, denoted as m-dot EVW, times the difference between the chemical potential of the substance at 0.003 degrees Celsius and the chemical potential when solid at 0.003 degrees Celsius, plus the variable x EIS1 times the difference between the chemical potential when liquid at 0.003 degrees Celsius and the chemical potential when solid at 0.003 degrees Celsius. This total equals Q one-half.
Solve for x EIS2.
