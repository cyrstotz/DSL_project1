The solution for part d) is the number 3 inside a box.

For part 4, subpart d), the kinetic energy \( E_K \) is given by the formula:
\[
E_K = \frac{|Q_{\text{zu}}|}{|W_{\text{el}}|}
\]
where \( |Q_{\text{zu}}| \) represents the absolute value of the heat added, and \( |W_{\text{el}}| \) represents the absolute value of the electrical work.
