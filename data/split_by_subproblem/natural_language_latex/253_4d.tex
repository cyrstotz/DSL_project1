The efficiency of K, denoted as epsilon subscript K, is equal to the ratio of Q dot subscript zu over the absolute value of W dot subscript e.

Q dot subscript zu equals Q dot subscript K, which equals the mass flow rate dot m subscript 13 in, multiplied by the difference h subscript 2 minus h subscript 1.

This equals 0.156 kilowatts.

Therefore, epsilon subscript K equals 5.58 times 10 to the power of negative 3.
