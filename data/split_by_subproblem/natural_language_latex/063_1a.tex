Assumption KF:

Zero equals the mass flow rate of KF times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat output.

The heat output equals the mass flow rate of KF times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet.

The heat input equals the mass flow rate of KF times c times the difference between the temperature at the outlet and the temperature at the inlet.

Zero equals the mass flow rate at the inlet times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat at the inlet minus the heat output.

The heat input equals the mass at the inlet times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat from the source.

The enthalpy at the outlet equals the enthalpy of fluid at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 419.04.

The enthalpy at the inlet equals the enthalpy of fluid at 70 degrees Celsius plus x times the difference between the enthalpy of gas at 70 degrees and the enthalpy of fluid at 70 degrees equals.
