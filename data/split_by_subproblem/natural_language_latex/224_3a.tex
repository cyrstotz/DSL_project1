The area \( A \) is equal to pi times the square of the diameter \( D \) divided by 4, which equals 0.007854 cubic meters.

The pressure \( p_{e2} \) is equal to the mass flow rate \( m_{e1} \) times the velocity \( v_{e1} \) divided by the area \( A \), plus the mass flow rate \( m_{e2} \) times the gravitational acceleration \( g \) divided by the area \( A \), plus the base pressure \( p_{0m} \), which equals 1.4 bar.

The product of pressure \( p_{e1} \) and volume \( V_{e1} \) equals the mass flow rate \( G_1 \) times the gas constant \( R \) divided by the temperature \( T_{e1} \), and the product of pressure \( p_{e2} \) and volume \( V_{e2} \) equals the mass flow rate \( G_2 \) times the gas constant \( R \) divided by the temperature \( T_{e2} \).

The ratio of volume \( V_{e1} \) to mass \( m_{e1} \) is equal to the ratio of volume \( V_{e2} \) to mass \( m_{e2} \).

The mass \( m_{e2} \) is equal to the product of pressure \( p_{e1} \) and volume \( V_{e1} \) divided by the gas constant \( R \) divided by the temperature \( T_{e1} \), which equals 0.109 kilograms.
