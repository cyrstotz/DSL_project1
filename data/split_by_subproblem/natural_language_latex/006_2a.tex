The subsection includes a centered image from a file named 'graph.png'. The width of the image is 80% of the text width.

Description of the graph: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled 'T [K]' (Temperature in Kelvin) and the horizontal axis labeled 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]' (entropy per kilogram per Kelvin). The plot features a curve that starts at point 1, progresses to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 4. There is a dashed line connecting points 2 and 3, labeled 'P23'. The curve then continues from point 4 to point 5, and then to point 6. The curve is smooth and depicts a typical thermodynamic process.
