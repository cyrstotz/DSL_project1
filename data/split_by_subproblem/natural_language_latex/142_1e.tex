a) The delivered exergy

The rate of exergy change is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the exergy at the exit and the exergy at the entrance, plus the rate of heat transfer into the system minus the rate of heat transfer out of the system.

The rate of exergy out is 62.182 kilowatts, which implies the time derivative of the rate of heat transfer out of the system divided by the temperature.

e)

The change in entropy from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the initial mass times the entropy at state 3 minus the mass at state 1 times the entropy at state 1. The change in entropy from state 1 to state 2 is 1.22753 kilojoules per Kelvin.

The entropy at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius is equal to the entropy at the saturated liquid state plus the quality times the difference between the entropy at the saturated vapor state and the entropy at the saturated liquid state.

The entropy at a temperature of 1000 degrees Celsius is 7.3005 kilograms per Kelvin.

The entropy at a temperature of 700 degrees Celsius is 7.3500 kilograms per Kelvin.

The entropy at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius is 0.950 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The mass of gas is equal to the initial mass of gas plus the change in mass.

The mass of the component is equal to the mass of gas.
