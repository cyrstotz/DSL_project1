a) The value of \( X_{E_{1,2}} \) for \( Ge_1 \) and \( T_{3,2} \) is 0.005 degrees Celsius, which equals \( T_{E_{1,2}} \).

The ratio \( X_{E_{1,2}} \) is given by the fraction of \( m_{E_{1}} \) over \( m_{E_{W}} \), which equals 0.6.

Energy balance over the entire system or the entire kinetic theory:

The total \( O \) is the sum of \( m \) times the ratio \( \frac{u}{u} \) plus \( q \) minus \( \gamma \) times the ratio \( \frac{u}{u} \) (no loss).

The total \( O \) equals the change in energy \( \Delta E \) which is equal to \( Q \times U \).

The total \( O \) is given by \( m_{E_{W}} \times u_{1} \) plus \( m_{E_{1}} \times u_{2} \) plus \( m_{g} \) times the difference between \( \frac{u_{2}}{u_{1}} \) and \( \frac{u_{1}}{u_{2}} \).

The total \( O \) is \( m_{E_{W}} \) times the ratio \( \frac{u_{1}}{u_{2}} \) plus \( m_{g} \times C_{v} \) times the difference between \( T_{2,g} \) and \( T_{1,s} \) (ideal gas model).

The value of \( \varepsilon_{p} \) is \( R + C_{v} \) which equals \( R_{g} + C_{v} \) and the sum is 0.755 times \( \frac{k}{u_{k}} \).

The value of \( u_{1} \) is \( U_{FL} \) plus \( X_{1} \) times the difference between \( U_{FL} \) and \( U_{FL} \).

The value of \( u_{2} \) is \( U_{FL} \) plus \( X_{2} \) times the difference between \( U_{E_{1}} \) and \( U_{FL} \).

The total \( O \) is \( m_{E_{W}} \) times the difference between \( U_{FL} \) and \( U_{FL} \) minus \( U_{FL} \) minus \( X_{2} \) times the difference between \( U_{FL} \) and \( U_{FL} \) plus \( m_{g} \times C_{v} \) times the difference between \( T_{2,g} \) and \( T_{1,s} \).

The total \( O \) is \( m_{E_{W}} \) times the difference between \( U_{E_{1}} \) and \( U_{FL} \) times the difference between \( X_{1} \) and \( X_{2} \) plus \( m_{g} \times C_{v} \) times the difference between \( T_{2,g} \) and \( T_{1,s} \).

The total \( O \) is \( m_{E_{W}} \) times the difference between \( U_{E_{1}} \) and \( U_{FL} \) times \( X_{1} \) minus \( m_{E_{1}} \) times the difference between \( U_{E_{1}} \) and \( U_{FL} \) times \( X_{2} \) plus \( m_{g} \times C_{v} \) times the difference between \( T_{2,s} \) and \( T_{1,s} \).

The value of \( X_{2} \) is \( X_{1} \) plus the fraction of \( m_{g} \times C_{v} \) times the difference between \( T_{2,s} \) and \( T_{1,s} \) over \( m_{E_{W}} \) times the difference between \( U_{E_{1}} \) and \( U_{FL} \).

The difference between \( U_{E_{FL}} \) and \( U_{T_{s}} \) at 0.003 is -333.4 times \( \frac{k}{u_{g}} \).

The value of \( U_{FL} \) is \( U_{FL} \) at 0.001 minus 0.007 times \( \frac{k}{u_{g}} \).
