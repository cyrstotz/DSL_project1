The variable \( p_{g2} \) is equal to what? 
\( p_{g2} \) equals the ratio of \( m_{g2} \) over \( V \), which is \( \frac{37.4 \text{ kg}}{0.03 \text{ m}^3} \), multiplied by \( 1 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} \) and \( 1 \text{K} \), resulting in \( 1.4 \text{ bar} \).
\( p_{g2} \) is also equal to \( p_{bar} \) plus the product of \( \frac{m_{g2}}{V} \), \( \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} \), and \( \text{K} \), which equals \( 1.4 \text{ bar} \).
This results in \( 125405 \text{ Pa} \).
