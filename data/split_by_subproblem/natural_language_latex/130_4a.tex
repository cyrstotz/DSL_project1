Graph 1: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as p and the horizontal axis labeled as T (k). There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The points 1 and 2 are connected by a horizontal line labeled "Isobar". The points 3 and 4 are also connected by a horizontal line labeled "Isobar". There is a curved line passing through points 1, 4, 3, and 2, forming a loop. The region inside the loop is labeled "Isobar".

Graph 2: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as p and the horizontal axis labeled as T. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The points 1 and 2 are connected by a horizontal line labeled "liquid". The points 3 and 4 are connected by a horizontal line labeled "saturated vapor". There is a curved line passing through points 1, 4, 3, and 2, forming a loop. The region inside the loop is labeled "liquid" and "saturated vapor".
