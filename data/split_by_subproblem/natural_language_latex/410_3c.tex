Energy balance on the gas:
- The change in energy, Delta E, equals Q12 minus Wu.
- The product of mass m and the difference in internal energy (u2 minus u1) plus Wu equals Q12.
- The product of mass m, specific heat at constant volume cV, and the temperature difference (Tg2 minus Tg1) plus the ratio of the gas constant R and the temperature difference (Tg2 minus T1) divided by (1 minus n) equals Q12.

The pressure Ps1 equals the ambient pressure Pamb plus the ratio of the product of mass mk and gravitational acceleration g to the square of half the diameter D squared times pi, plus the ratio of the product of mass mew and gravitational acceleration g to the square of half the diameter D squared times pi.
- Ps1 equals 1.401 bar.

The specific gas constant Rs equals the gas constant R divided by the molar mass Mg, which equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The volume Vz equals the product of mass mg, specific gas constant Rs, and temperature Tg12 divided by the pressure Pc.
