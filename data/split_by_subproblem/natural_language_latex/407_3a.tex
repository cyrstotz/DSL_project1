Pressure equilibrium:

P three one equals the fraction of m over A zyr times g plus P amp plus the fraction of m times v squared over A zyr.

A zyr equals the quantity D over two squared times pi equals 0.00485 square meters.

P three one equals 1.4 bar.

R goes to R over M equals 48.34 Joules per kilogram Kelvin equals 166.28 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.

pV equals mRT.

m s equals the fraction of P three one times V one over R times T in equals 3.5 grams.
