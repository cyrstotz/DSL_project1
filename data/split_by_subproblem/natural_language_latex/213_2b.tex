Energy balance:

The equation m_subscript_total times (h_5 minus h_6 plus w_5 squared over 2 minus k_subscript_e6) equals zero.

The ratio T_6 over T_5 equals (P_6 over P_5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 over n), which implies T_6 equals (P_6 over P_5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 over n) times T_5 equals 328.0747 Kelvin.

The equation h_5 minus h_6 plus one-half w_5 squared minus one-half w_6 squared equals zero.

The equation for w_6 squared equals 2 times (h_5 minus h_6) plus w_5 squared equals the square root of 2 times c_p times (T_5 minus T_6) plus w_5 squared equals the square root of 2 times 1006 times (403.8 minus 400) plus 220 squared.

This results in w_6 equals 507.29 meters per second.
