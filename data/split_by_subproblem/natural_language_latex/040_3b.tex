The change in kinetic energy, denoted as Delta E_kin,2, is greater than zero. We are asked to find T_g,2 and P_g,2.

State 2: There is a thermodynamic equilibrium between the evaporated water (EW) and the gas, which means there is no heat flow and thus the temperature is the same.

The temperature T is given by the equation T equals the product of P_g,2 and V_g,2 divided by the product of m_g and R.

T_g,2 is equal to T_EW,2, and P_g,2 equals... (the equation is incomplete).
