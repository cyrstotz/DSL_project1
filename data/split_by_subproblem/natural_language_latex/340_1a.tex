Energy balance of heat:
- The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 1 and state 2, plus the heat transfer rate, minus the work rate.
- The heat transfer rate is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 1 and state 2.
- The heat transfer rate is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between 4.19 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times 80 degrees Celsius and 292.94 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The heat transfer rate is 37.8 kilowatts per kilogram.
