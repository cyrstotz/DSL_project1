Zero equals the mass flow rate of KF times the difference in entropy at state 2 and state 1 of water, plus the mass flow rate from state 1 to state 2 of water times the difference in entropy at state 2 and state 1 of water, equals the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature at R plus the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature at KF plus the entropy generation from state 1 to state 2.

The heat transfer rate divided by the temperature at KF equals 65 kilowatts divided by 295 Kelvin equals 0.22 times 10 to the power of 3 watts per Kelvin.

The heat transfer rate divided by the temperature at R equals 100 kilowatts divided by 373.15 Kelvin equals 267.88 watts per Kelvin.

The entropy at state 1 of water at 25 degrees Celsius equals 0.3543 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy at state 2 of water at 100 degrees Celsius equals 1.3063 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The difference in entropy between state 2 and state 1 of KF equals the specific heat at constant volume times the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature at state 2 to temperature at state 1.
