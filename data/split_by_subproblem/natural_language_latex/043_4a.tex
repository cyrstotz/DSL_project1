The graph is described as a p-T diagram, where the p axis represents pressure and is vertical, and the T axis represents temperature and is horizontal. There are four points on the graph labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "isobar", the path from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "isotrop", the path from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "isobar", and the path from point 4 back to point 1 is labeled as "adiabat". These paths together form a closed loop.
