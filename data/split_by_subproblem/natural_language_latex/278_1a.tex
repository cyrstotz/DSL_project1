Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat rate added minus the heat rate removed. The heat rate removed equals the heat rate added plus the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, which equals 100 kilowatts plus 0.3 kilograms per second times (292.98 kilojoules per kilogram minus 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram), resulting in 62.18 kilowatts.

The enthalpy at the inlet, denoted as \( h_{\text{ein}} \), for a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram. The enthalpy at the outlet, denoted as \( h_{\text{aus}} \), for a temperature of 120 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.
