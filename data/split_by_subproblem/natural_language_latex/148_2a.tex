Graph Description:

The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as "s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin" and the y-axis labeled as "T in Kelvin". There are two curves on the graph. The first curve starts at point 1, goes up to point 2, then sharply rises to point 3, and then descends to point 4. The second curve starts at point 5, rises to point 6, and then continues to point 4. The pressure is indicated as p equals 0.5 bar.
