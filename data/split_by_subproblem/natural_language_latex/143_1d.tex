d) Energy balance: Delta E equals Delta U; the heat transfer Q_R,12 equals negative 35 megajoules.

This implies that U_2 minus U_1 equals Delta m_12 times h at 20 degrees Celsius plus Q_R,12.

The total mass at state 1, m_ges,1, is 5755 kilograms, which is equal to m_1.

The total mass at state 2, m_ges,2, equals m_ges,1 plus Delta m_12, which is equal to m_2.

m_2 times U_2 minus m_1 times U_1 equals Delta m_12 times h at 20 degrees Celsius plus Q_R,12.

Delta m_12 times (U_2 minus h at 20 degrees Celsius) equals m_1 times (u_1 minus U_2) plus Q_R,12.

Delta m_12 equals the fraction of m_1 times (u_1 minus U_2) plus Q_R,12 divided by (U_2 minus h at 20 degrees Celsius).

From Table A-2:

h at 20 degrees Celsius equals h_f at 20 degrees Celsius, which is 83.96.

u_2 equals u_f at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 292.95.

u_1 equals u_f at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 418.94.

This results in Delta m_12 being 3302 kilograms.
