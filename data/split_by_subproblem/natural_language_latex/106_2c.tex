The expressions provided are as follows:

1. The expression for ex_str,6 is given by:
   ex_str,6 equals h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus one-half times omega_6 squared.

2. The expression for ex_str,0 is given by:
   ex_str,0 equals h_0 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_0 minus s_0) plus one-half times omega_0 squared.

3. The change in ex_str from 0 to 6, denoted as Delta ex_str,06, is calculated as:
   Delta ex_str,06 equals ex_str,6 minus ex_str,0 which simplifies to h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times s_6 plus T_0 times s_0 plus one-half times omega_6 squared minus one-half times omega_0 squared.

4. This further simplifies to:
   Delta ex_str,06 equals c_p times (T_6 minus T_0) equals negative T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0).

5. Another expression for Delta ex_str,06 is given by:
   Delta ex_str,06 equals c_p times (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 times (c_p times the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0) plus (omega_6 squared minus omega_0 squared) divided by 2) minus R_u times (dot V_es divided by dot m_p).

6. The final value is stated as:
   120.8 kilojoules per kilogram.
