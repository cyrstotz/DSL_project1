For the stationary case, the equation is zero equals m dot times the difference between s sub e and s sub a plus Q dot sub i divided by T sub i plus S sub generated. The generated entropy S sub generated is equal to Q dot sub i divided by T, which equals 65000 Watts divided by 295 Kelvin, resulting in approximately 22.0339 Watts per Kelvin.
