The heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{zu} \) is the larger of \( \dot{Q}_2 = 100 \, \text{kW} \) and \( \dot{Q}_w \) from the SMO.

The rate of change of energy \( \frac{dE}{dt} \) is equal to the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference in enthalpy \( h_e - h_a \) plus \( \dot{Q}_w \) plus \( \dot{Q}_{zu} \).

\( \dot{Q}_w \) is equal to the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference in enthalpy \( h_a - h_e \).

The task is to find the missing values where \( x = 0 = x_a \).

The values are as follows:
- \( h_a = 252.50 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) (from Table A2),
- \( h_e = 417.04 \, \text{kJ/kg} \),
- \( \dot{Q}_w = 37.8 \, \text{kW} \) (this is possible as the corresponding line in the diagram),
- \( \dot{Q}_{zu} = \dot{Q}_2 - \dot{Q}_w = 62.2 \, \text{kW} \).
