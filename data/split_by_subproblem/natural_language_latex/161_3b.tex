The graph description is as follows: The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as 'p(bar)' and the x-axis labeled as 'T(degrees Celsius)'. There are three points labeled '1', '2', and '3'. Point '1' is in the "liquid" region, point '2' is in the "solid" region, and point '3' is in the "vapor" region. There are horizontal and vertical lines connecting these points, forming a step-like structure.
