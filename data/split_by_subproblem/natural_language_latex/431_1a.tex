Zero equals the mass flow rate in times the enthalpy in minus the mass flow rate out times the enthalpy out plus the heat transfer rate minus the work rate plus the radiation heat transfer rate.

The enthalpy in at 70 degrees Celsius equals 252.38 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy out at 100 degrees Celsius equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat transfer rate out equals the mass flow rate out times the enthalpy out minus the mass flow rate in times the enthalpy in, which equals the radiation heat transfer rate divided by the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy out and the enthalpy in minus the radiation heat transfer rate.

The heat transfer rate out equals negative 62.18 kilowatts.
