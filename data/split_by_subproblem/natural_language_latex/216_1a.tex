The subsection is about the heat output, Q, from the combustion of liquefied gas.

The first equation is:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the integral of (enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at entry plus kinetic energy plus potential energy) plus the sum over j of (mass flow rate of j) minus the sum over n of (volume flow rate of n times enthalpy of n).

The second equation simplifies to:
Zero equals the mass flow rate at entry times (enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at entry) plus the heat input minus the heat output.

The third equation rearranges to express the heat output:
Heat output equals the mass flow rate at entry times (enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at entry) plus the heat input.

The final value of the heat output is given as:
61.972 kilowatts.
