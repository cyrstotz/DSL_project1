The rate of change of external entropy, S_ext dot of t, equals negative m dot times the difference between S_e and S_a, minus the ratio of Q_aus dot over the average temperature T_KF bar.

This equals negative 0.3 kilograms per second times the product of C and the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_e over T_p, minus the ratio of 65 kilowatts over 298 Kelvin.

The equation is left incomplete with an equals sign followed by no further expression.
