The change in exergy rate for the process, denoted as Delta dot E subscript x, sarro, c, equals the mass flow rate dot m times the expression in brackets: h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus w subscript c2 squared divided by 2, evaluated at T subscript 0 equals 243.15 Kelvin.

The change in exergy rate for the stream, denoted as Delta dot e subscript x, str, equals 12.158 kilojoules per kilogram times w subscript c2 squared divided by 2, which equals 116.487 kilojoules per kilogram underlined.

The difference h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 equals c subscript p times (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) plus v subscript i times (p subscript 6 minus p subscript 0), which equals 85.434 kilojoules per kilogram, evaluated at zero.

T subscript 6 equals 328.075 Kelvin.

T subscript 0 equals 30 plus 273.15, which equals 243.15 Kelvin.

The difference s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0 equals c subscript p times the natural logarithm of T subscript 6 over T subscript 0, which equals 0.301 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

c subscript c2 equals 507.24 meters per second.

w subscript c2 squared divided by 2 equals 128646.
