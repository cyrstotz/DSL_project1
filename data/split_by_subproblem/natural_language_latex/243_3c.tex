c) The heat transfer Q equals the overflow OF, which is Q12 minus U12, equals zero. This implies that Q equals U equals Cv times the difference in temperature from T2 to T1, which equals Cp minus R over M times the difference in temperature from T2 to T1, equals 9.46672 times the quantity 0.003 times the fraction of 8.314 times 200 over 500 minus 500.

The volume V2 equals the mass m times the gas constant R times the temperature T1 divided by the pressure P, equals 0.003 kilograms times 8.314 Joules per mole per Kelvin times 200 Kelvin divided by 750 Pascals, equals 0.00.

The specific heat at constant volume Cv equals the specific heat at constant pressure Cp minus the fraction of the gas constant R over the molar mass M, equals 0.46672.
