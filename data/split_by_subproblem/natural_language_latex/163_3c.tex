Energy balance around the lower chamber closed system:

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) equals zero.

The change in energy \( \Delta E \) is equal to the change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) plus the change in potential energy \( \Delta PE \) plus the change in kinetic energy \( \Delta KE \), which equals \( Q_{12} \) minus the work done \( W_{12} \).

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is equal to the mass \( m \) times the specific heat at constant volume \( c_v \) times the change in internal energy \( U_2 - U_1 \) minus the work \( W_{v12} \).

The change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 for a perfect gas \( U_2^{pg} - U_1^{pg} \) is equal to the specific heat at constant volume for a perfect gas \( c_v^{pg} \) times the temperature difference \( T_2 - T_1 \), which equals \( 0.1633 \frac{kJ}{kgK} \) times \( (500^\circ C - 0^\circ C) \) resulting in \( 3.163 \frac{kJ}{kg} \).

Therefore, the heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is equal to \( 0.0034 \frac{kg}{s} \) times \( 3.615 \frac{kJ}{kg} \), resulting in \( 1.082 \, kJ \).
