Energy balance:

Zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy in and the enthalpy out, plus the heat flow out, plus the heat flow due to radiation.

Zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius and the enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius, minus the heat flow out, plus the heat flow due to radiation.

This implies that the mass flow rate in equals 0.3 kilograms per second.

The enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius equals 232.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius equals 419.011 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat flow out equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius and the enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius, plus 1 cool kilowatt.

The heat flow out equals 62.182 kilowatts.
