Mass flow rate of R134a.

State 2: Saturated, wet steam, hence \( h_2 = \).

State 3: The pressure \( p_3 \) is 8 bar, the enthalpy \( h_3 \) is 84.74 kilojoules per kilogram (refer to Table A-11).

The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy from state 2 to state 3 equals the compressor work \( \dot{W}_k \).

State 4: Just fully condensed refrigerant, isobaric condition: \( p_3 = p_4 \).

Thus, \( h_4 = 93.42 \) kilojoules per kilogram.

The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy from state 3 to state 4 equals the heat rejected \( \dot{Q}_{ab} \).
