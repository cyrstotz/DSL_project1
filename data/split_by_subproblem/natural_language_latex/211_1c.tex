System around the wall:

Zero equals the rate of heat output divided by the temperature of the reactor minus the rate of heat output divided by the temperature of the coolant plus the rate of entropy generation.

This implies that the rate of entropy generation equals the rate of heat output divided by the temperature of the coolant minus the rate of heat output divided by the temperature of the reactor.

This equals 65 kilowatts divided by 293.1 Kelvin minus 65 kilowatts divided by 373.15 Kelvin, which approximately equals negative 16.21 kilowatts per Kelvin.

(The temperature of the reactor is 100 degrees Celsius, which equals 373.15 Kelvin.)
