Energy balance

The enthalpy at x equals 1 is 292.18 kilojoules per kilogram (refer to Table A-2).
The enthalpy at x equals 0 is 149.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The rate of change of energy with respect to time is the sum of mass flow rate times enthalpy plus heat transfer minus work, which leads to an unreadable result.

Setting the equation to zero gives mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy plus heat input minus heat output plus heat transfer, which simplifies to heat output equals mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy plus heat input.

The heat output equals 0.3 times the difference between 292.18 and 149.04 plus 10 kilowatts, resulting in 62.18 kilowatts.
