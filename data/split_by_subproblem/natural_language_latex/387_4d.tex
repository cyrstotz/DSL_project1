The equation for \( q_u \) is given by the ratio of \( \dot{Q}_u \) over \( \dot{W}_t \), which equals 1.323. The values in the numerator and denominator are scribbled out.

The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_u \) is calculated as the product of \( \dot{m}_E \) and the difference in enthalpy \( h_2 - h_1 \). The specific values for \( \dot{m}_E \) and \( h_2 - h_1 \) are scribbled out, and the units are in watts.

The ratio \( \dot{u}_s \) over \( \Delta h_{12} \) is mentioned but not completed.

The enthalpy \( h_1 \) is expressed as \( h_f \) at negative 22 degrees Celsius plus \( x \) times the difference between \( h_s \) at negative 22 degrees Celsius and \( h_f \) at negative 22 degrees Celsius.

This results in a value of 32.9 times the ratio of \( u_f \) over \( u_s \).

The value of \( u_2 \) is given as 234.08 times the ratio of \( u_f \) over \( u_s \).
