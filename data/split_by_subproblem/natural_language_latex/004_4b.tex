Energy balance around the compressor implies isentropic process:

The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy (h1 minus h3) minus the power equals zero.

The pressure p2 equals pressure p1.

The enthalpy h4 equals enthalpy h1.

The entropy S2 equals entropy S3.

The enthalpy h1 equals 63.53 kilojoules per kilogram.

Use entropy S3 to interpolate enthalpy h3 in table A9.

The pressure p4 equals pressure p3.

Entropy S2 was calculated previously.

Entropy S2 is to be interpolated with pressure px.

The pressure px equals 2.2688 bar.

Entropy S2 is calculated as follows: (2.2688 minus 2.25) divided by (2.2688 minus 2.25) times (0.9566 minus 0.9636) plus 0.9636.

Entropy S2 equals 0.9632, which is equal to entropy S3.
