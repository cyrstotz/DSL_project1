The graph description is as follows: The graph is a pressure-temperature diagram, denoted as P-T diagram. The x-axis is labeled T, representing temperature, and the y-axis is labeled P, representing pressure. The graph includes four points labeled as (1), (2), (3), and (4), which are connected by lines to form a closed loop. The path from point (1) to point (2) and from point (3) to point (4) is marked as "isobar," indicating constant pressure, and is colored in orange. The path from point (2) to point (3) is marked as "isentrop," indicating constant entropy, and is also colored in orange. The path from point (4) to point (1) is a curved line labeled "saturated liquid" and "wet steam area" in blue. Additionally, the point (2) is specifically labeled with "P equals 12."
