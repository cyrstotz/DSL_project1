Graph with the following details:
- Y-axis labeled as T in units of terajoules per kilogram-kelvin.
- X-axis labeled as s in units of terajoules per kilogram-kelvin.
- Four curves labeled as follows:
  1. Curve passing through points 1 and 2 labeled as "isentrope".
  2. Curve passing through points 3 and 4 labeled as "isobar".
  3. Curve passing through points 4 and 5 labeled as "isobar".
  4. Curve passing through points 1 and 5 labeled as "isobar".
- Points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are marked on the graph.
- The curve passing through points 1 and 2 is labeled as p squared equals p cubed.
- The curve passing through points 3 and 4 is labeled as p squared equals p to the fourth equals p to the fifth.
