Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at point one and enthalpy at point two, minus the heat transfer rate.

The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at point one and enthalpy at point two.

The difference between enthalpy at point two and enthalpy at point one equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between point two and point one, plus the velocity divided by gravity times the difference in pressure between point two and point one.

Table:

The temperature at point one is 288.15 Kelvin.

The temperature at point two is 258.15 Kelvin.

The enthalpy at 288.15 Kelvin is 62.83 kilojoules per kilogram, as found in Table A-2.

The enthalpy at 258.15 Kelvin is 104.83 kilojoules per kilogram.
