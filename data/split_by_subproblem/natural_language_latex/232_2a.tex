Graph Description: The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled 'S' in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled 'T' in Kelvin. There are several curves on the graph, each representing different processes. The curves are labeled as follows:

- Curve 1-2: adiabatic process labeled as "isentropic"
- Curve 2-3: isobaric process labeled as "isobar"

There are six points marked on the graph, labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by the curves mentioned above. The graph also includes the following annotations:

- The pressure at point 1 equals the pressure at point 3.
- The pressure at point 2 equals the pressure at point 5.
- The pressure at point 0 equals the pressure at point 6.
- The pressure at point 4 equals the pressure at point 5.
- The pressure, temperature, and enthalpy at point 0 are equal to the pressure at point 6.
