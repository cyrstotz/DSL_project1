Required: T_g2 plus p_g2

The process is adiabatic, therefore the process is polytropic, meaning pV raised to the power of n equals a constant.

From the ideal gas equation pV equals mRT, it follows that if pV raised to the power of n equals a constant, the whole process must also be isothermal!

T_g2 equals T_g1 equals 500 degrees Celsius.

(pV raised to the power of n equals mRT)

p_2 equals (mRT divided by V raised to the power of n) equals (3.1422 times 10 to the power of negative 3 times 116.28) divided by (3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 raised to the power of n).
