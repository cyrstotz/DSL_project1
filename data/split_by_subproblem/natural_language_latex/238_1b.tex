The thermodynamic average temperature can be determined as follows:

Q equals the mass flow rate at the inlet times the difference in entropy at the inlet and outlet plus the heat rejected divided by temperature T.

T equals the integral from entropy at point a to entropy at point e of T ds.

The difference between entropy at point a and entropy at point e equals the integral from temperature T1 to temperature T2 of c over T dT, which equals c times the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature at the outlet to temperature at the inlet, which equals c times 0.0341155.

T equals s divided by c times 0.0341155.
