Section d) Closed Piston

The change in energy from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the heat added minus the work done, for an incompressible fluid:
E2 minus E1 equals Q minus W_u^0.

The mass flow rate times the change in internal energy equals the heat added:
m_ew times (u2 minus u1) equals Q.

The internal energy at state 2 is given by:
u2 equals Q divided by m_ew plus u1.

The internal energy at state 1 is expressed as:
u1 equals u_f plus x1 times (u_g minus u_f).

Table 1:
The internal energy at melting point for water at 0 degrees Celsius is -0.045 kJ/kg.
The internal energy of vapor at 0 degrees Celsius is -333.458 kJ/kg.

The internal energy at state 2 is calculated as:
u2 equals -0.045 plus 0.6 times (-333.458 minus (-0.045)),
which equals -260.0928 kJ/kg.

Another calculation for u2 is:
u2 equals (-1.36742 kJ/0.1 kg minus 200.0928 kJ/kg) divided by 0.1 kg,
which equals -213.7628 kJ/kg.

The internal energy at state 2 can also be expressed as:
u2 equals u_f plus x2 times (u_g minus u_f).

The quality at state 2 is calculated as:
x2 equals (u2 minus u_f) divided by (u_g minus u_f),
which approximately equals 0.641.
