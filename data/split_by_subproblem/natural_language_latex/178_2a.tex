The content describes a graph of T versus S. The vertical axis represents T in kilojoules, and the horizontal axis represents S in kilojoules per kilogram.

The graph forms a closed loop with specific points and segments:
- Point 1 is located at the origin, coordinates (0,0).
- Point 2 is directly above Point 1 and is connected to it by a vertical line.
- Point 3 is to the right of Point 2 and is connected to it by a line labeled "isobare".
- Point 4 is directly below Point 3 and is connected to it by a vertical line.
- Point 5 is to the left of Point 4 and is connected to it by a line labeled "isokare".
- Point 6 is directly below Point 5 and is connected to it by a vertical line labeled "isobare".
- Point 6 connects back to Point 1, completing the loop.

The points on the graph are labeled sequentially from 1 to 6.
