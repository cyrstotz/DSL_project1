The enthalpy at the inlet, denoted as \( h_{\text{ein}} \), is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced from source A-2. The enthalpy at the outlet, denoted as \( h_{\text{aus}} \), is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced from source 1+2.

Energy balance:
The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate, denoted as \( \dot{m} \), times the difference between the inlet enthalpy and the outlet enthalpy, plus the heat transfer rate, denoted as \( \dot{Q} \), minus the work rate, denoted as \( \dot{W} \), under the condition of being isothermal. The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q} \) equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the outlet enthalpy and the inlet enthalpy, which equals 37.818 kilowatts. The net heat transfer rate, denoted as \( Q_{\text{aus}} \), is calculated as \( \dot{Q} \) minus \( \dot{Q} \), resulting in an underlined value of 62.182 kilowatts.
