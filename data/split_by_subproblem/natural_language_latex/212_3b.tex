The pressure \( p_a \) is 1.5 bar, and the mass \( m_c \) is 3.6 grams.

The equation \( p \cdot V = m \cdot R \cdot T \) represents the ideal gas law.

The pressure \( p_2 \) equals \( p_1 \), which implies that the pressure must remain constant because the system is in equilibrium and neither the weight of the piston nor the air pressure changes.

The temperature \( T \) is calculated by the formula \( T = \frac{p \cdot V}{m \cdot R} \).

The temperature remains constant.
