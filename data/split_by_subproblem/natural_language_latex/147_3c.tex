Closed systems:

The change in energy from state 1 to state 2 is given by the equation:
E2 minus E1 equals Q12 minus Wu,12.

The change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 is given by the equation:
U2 minus U1 equals Q12 minus Uv,12.

The volume at state 2 is calculated as:
V2 equals m times R times T2 divided by p2 (which equals p1),
which equals 3.422 kilograms times 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times 273.15 Kelvin divided by 140090 Pascals, resulting in 1.11 liters.

The work done during volume change from v1 to v2, where pressure p is constant, is given by:
Wv,12 equals the integral from v1 to v2 of p dV,
which equals the integral from 0.00314 to 0.0014 of 140090 dV,
which equals 140090 times (0.0014 minus 0.00314),
resulting in -284.4 Joules per meter equals -873.16 Joules per kilogram.

The internal energy at state 2 is:
u2 equals u1 plus vu,12 equals q12.

The heat added or removed for a perfect gas from state 1 to state 2 is:
q12 equals cv times (T2 minus T1) plus vu,12,
which equals 0.653 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (273.15 Kelvin minus 273.15 Kelvin) times 3.622 Joules per gram minus 873.16 Joules per kilogram,
resulting in -2056 Joules.
