Q equals the mass flow rate times the quantity of specific enthalpy at the exit minus specific enthalpy at the entrance plus half the velocity at the exit squared minus half the velocity at the entrance squared plus the sum of heat transfer minus the sum of work done. This is then simplified to the mass flow rate times the difference in specific enthalpy at the exit and entrance plus heat transfer minus heat transfer out. Heat transfer out is defined as the mass flow rate times the difference in specific enthalpy at the exit and entrance plus the heat transfer rate. Substituting values, heat transfer out equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the specific enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius minus the specific enthalpy at 400 degrees Celsius plus 100 kilowatts. This simplifies to 0.3 times (292.93 minus 419.04) plus 100 kilowatts, which approximately equals 62.182 kilowatts.
