The rate of exergy change, denoted as dot E subscript ex, equals the mass flow rate, denoted as dot m, times the expression in brackets. Inside the brackets, the enthalpy at exit, denoted as h subscript e, minus the enthalpy at entrance, denoted as h subscript a, minus the product of the reference temperature, denoted as T subscript 0, and the difference in entropy between exit and entrance, denoted as s subscript e minus s subscript a.
