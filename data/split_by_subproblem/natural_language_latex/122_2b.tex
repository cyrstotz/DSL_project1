P3j equals P3j, and T3j equals TEW2 equals zero degrees Celsius.

State 2: no more heat transfer, therefore

the fraction of ice, xEis, is greater than zero which implies that TEW2 equals zero degrees Celsius.

Since there is still ice in the EW, the temperature remains equal to zero degrees Celsius. The pressure does not change in the gas, as the substances of the oil circuit remain, and the temperature of the gas assumes the temperature of the water, since there is no heat exchange in state 2.

Graphical Description:

There is a rectangular diagram divided into two horizontal sections. The top section is labeled "EW" and the bottom section is labeled "Oil". An arrow pointing downwards labeled "32 kg" is drawn from the top of the rectangle to the middle line separating the two sections.
