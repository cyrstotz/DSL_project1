Graph Description:

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as P in units of bar per Joule and the horizontal axis labeled as T in units of Kelvin. The plot starts at the origin and initially rises steeply, forming a peak at about one-third of the way along the horizontal axis. After reaching the peak, the plot gradually declines, forming a smooth, concave curve that extends towards the right end of the horizontal axis.
