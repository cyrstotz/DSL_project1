Since the density of ice and melted ice remains the same (melting does not change volume), the volume of ice initially, \( V_{\text{Eis,1}} \), is equal to the volume of ice afterwards, \( V_{\text{Eis,2}} \). Thermodynamic equilibrium implies that the temperature \( T_{g,12} \) equals the melting temperature \( T_{\text{Ew}} \). The pressure \( P_{g,12} \) can be calculated using the ideal gas law.
