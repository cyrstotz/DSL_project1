The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled T (Temperature) and the y-axis is labeled P (Pressure). The graph shows a curve starting from the origin and rising upwards. The curve is divided into three regions:
- The region below the curve is labeled "Solid".
- The region on the curve is labeled "isothermal" and "isobaric".
- The region above the curve is labeled "Liquid".
There are three points marked on the curve:
- Point 1 is at the top right of the curve.
- Point 2 is at the middle of the curve.
- Point 3 is at the bottom left of the curve.
The region between points 2 and 3 is labeled "Gas".
