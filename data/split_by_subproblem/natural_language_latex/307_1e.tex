e) The change in mass, denoted as delta m sub 12, equals 3600 kilograms.

Entropy balance:

The change in entropy, delta S, is equal to m sub 2 times s sub 2 minus m sub 1 times s sub 1.

s sub 1 is calculated as follows: it is equal to s sub f at 100 degrees Celsius plus x sub 0 times the difference between s sub g at 100 degrees Celsius and s sub f at 100 degrees Celsius, which results in 1.33 plus 14 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

s sub 2 is given by s sub f at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Therefore, the change in entropy, delta s, is equal to the sum of m sub 1 and delta m sub 12 times s sub 2 minus m sub 1 times s sub 1, resulting in 1237.85 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
