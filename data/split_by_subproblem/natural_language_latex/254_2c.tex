Energy balance:

There is a table with two columns labeled "Diagram" and "Description". In the "Diagram" column, there is a description of a diagram of a control volume with an inlet labeled 5 and an outlet labeled 6. There are arrows pointing into the control volume at inlet 5 and pointing out of the control volume at outlet 6.

The equation zero equals m dot times the quantity h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 plus one-half times the quantity w subscript 5 squared minus w subscript 6 squared.

The velocity at outlet 6, w subscript 6, equals the square root of w subscript 5 squared minus two times the quantity h subscript 6 minus h subscript 5, which is also equal to the square root of w subscript 5 squared minus two times c subscript p times the quantity T subscript 6 minus T subscript 5.

The velocity at outlet 6, w subscript 6, equals 508.6 meters per second.
