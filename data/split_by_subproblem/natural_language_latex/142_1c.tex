The rate of change of energy, denoted as E dot, equals the mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, times the difference between the exit energy per unit mass, e sub e, and the entry energy per unit mass, e sub a, plus the ratio of the heat transfer rate out, Q dot sub aus, to the temperature T, plus the rate of entropy generation, S dot sub gen.
