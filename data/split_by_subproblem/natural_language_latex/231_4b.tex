Energy balance over the compressor:

The power input to the compressor, denoted as W-dot subscript k, equals the mass flow rate of dry air, denoted as m-dot subscript da, times the difference in enthalpy between the exit and the inlet, expressed as (h subscript e minus h subscript a).

The enthalpy at the exit, h subscript e, equals h subscript 2, which is the enthalpy at temperature T subscript 2, calculated at negative 18 degrees Celsius, and is 236.53 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at the inlet, h subscript a, is the enthalpy at a pressure of 8 bar, and is 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram.

The temperature T subscript 2 is the initial temperature T subscript i minus 6 Kelvin.

The ratio of the power input to the compressor to the difference in enthalpy between the temperatures T subscript 2 and the pressure of 8 bar is 0.088 kilowatts divided by 28 watts, which equals 0.088 kilowatts divided by the difference (236.53 minus 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram), resulting in negative 10.00101 kilograms per second.

The initial temperature T subscript i is negative 18 degrees Celsius.
