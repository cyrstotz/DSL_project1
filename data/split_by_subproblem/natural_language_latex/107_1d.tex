The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum over i of the mass flow rate of i times the sum of the enthalpy of i at time t, the kinetic energy of i at time t, and the potential energy of i at time t, plus the sum over j of the heat flow rate of j at time t, minus the sum over n of the work flow rate of n at time t.
