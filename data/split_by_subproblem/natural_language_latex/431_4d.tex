The rate of change of kinetic energy, denoted as E_k dot, equals the ratio of Q_2 dot times u over w_t dot, which equals w_k dot.

Calculate with the given values:
Zero equals m_R dot times (h_1 minus h_2) plus Q_k dot.

This implies that Q_k dot equals m_R dot times (h_2 minus h_1), which equals approximately 156.25 Watts.

h_1 equals h_4.

h_2 equals h_g at negative 22 degrees Celsius, which is 259.08 kilojoules per kilogram, according to TAD A10.

E_k dot equals 5.58.
