Subsection d) Delta m_12

Energy Balance

The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to m_2 times u_2 minus m_1 times u_1 plus dot m times the difference of h_e and h_a plus dot Q minus dot W to the power of zero.

(m_2 plus Delta m_12) times u_2 minus m_1 times u_1 equals Delta m_12 times h_e minus Q_out, which is equal to dot m times (u_2 minus u_1) plus Delta m_12 times h_e minus Q_out.

h_e equals h_f at 200 degrees Celsius plus x_0 times the difference of h_g at 200 degrees Celsius and h_f at 200 degrees Celsius.
