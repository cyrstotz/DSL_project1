a) The equation rho times g times h equals p_amb plus F over A. The steps are as follows:
- F equals 32 kilograms, which leads to 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared equals 314 Newtons.
- A equals pi times r squared, which is pi times (0.05 meters) squared.
- F over A equals 314 Newtons divided by pi times (0.05 meters) squared equals 40 Newtons per square meter.
- rho times g times h equals p_atm plus F over A equals 1.1 bar.
- pV equals m times R over M times T, which leads to m equals pV divided by R times T_1 equals (1.1 times 10^5 times 0.05) divided by (8.314 times 273) equals 3.12 grams.

Subsection a) Energy balance, with KE equals PE equals 0:
- The change in internal energy U_g equals Q minus W, with E_pot equals 0.
- Q equals the change in U_g equals m times the integral from T_1 to T_2 of c_v dT.
- This results in 0.0034 kilograms times (500 minus 0) times 0.632 equals 1082.14 Joules.
