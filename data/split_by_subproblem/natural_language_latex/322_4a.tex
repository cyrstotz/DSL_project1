a)

- The first graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled p and the horizontal axis labeled T in Kelvin.
- There are three curves in the graph:
  - The first curve starts from the bottom left, curves upwards, and then flattens out as it moves to the right. This curve is labeled \( p_{L, \text{short}} \).
  - The second curve starts from the top left, curves downwards, and intersects the first curve. This curve is labeled \( p_{G, \text{short}} \).
  - The third curve starts from the bottom left, curves upwards, and intersects the second curve. This curve is labeled \( p_{G, \text{short}} \).

- The second graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled p and the horizontal axis labeled T.
- There is a dome-shaped curve in the graph:
  - The left side of the curve is labeled "Liquid".
  - The right side of the curve is labeled "Gas".
  - The bottom of the curve is labeled "Mixture".
  - The top of the curve is labeled "Triple point".
  - There are two points marked on the curve:
    - Point 1 is on the left side of the curve.
    - Point 2 is on the right side of the curve.
