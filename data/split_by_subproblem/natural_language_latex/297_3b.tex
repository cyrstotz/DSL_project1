x subscript EW,1 equals 0.1 implies Pressed.

Pressure p subscript gr,2 equals p subscript gr,1, since the change in x subscript EW Pressed according to the negligible difference between solid and liquid, does not change the weight force (remains the same) which leads to the same pressure.

The volume of the gas does not change.
