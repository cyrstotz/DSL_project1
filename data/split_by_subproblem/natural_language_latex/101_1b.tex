Omega five equals 220 meters per second.
P five equals 0.5 bar.
T five equals 431.9 Kelvin.

Isentropic from 5 to 6.

The ratio of T six over T five equals the ratio of P six over P five raised to the power of (n minus 1) over n, where n equals k.

T six equals the ratio of 0.131 bar over 0.5 bar raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4, multiplied by 431.9 Kelvin, which equals 328.07 Kelvin, equals T six.

The mass flow rate times (h five minus h six plus the difference of omega five squared minus omega six squared over two) plus dot Q minus dot Q equals the mass flow rate times (h six minus h five) plus the difference of omega five squared minus omega six squared over two.
