The graph description is as follows: The graph is a pressure-temperature diagram, with the x-axis labeled as T for temperature and the y-axis labeled as p for pressure. There are three curves on the graph. The leftmost curve is labeled as p0, the middle curve is labeled as p1, and the rightmost curve is labeled as p2. The middle curve features a dome-shaped region in the middle, which represents the phase change region. The top of the dome touches the middle curve, and the bottom of the dome touches the x-axis. The curves display a wavy pattern that indicates the phase boundaries.
