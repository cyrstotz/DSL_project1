p2 equals 3.32 bar.

T1 equals negative 16 degrees Celsius and p1 equals 1.5 bar.

pi equals the ratio of p2 over p1, which is 3.32 divided by 1.5, resulting in 2.21.

T2 equals negative 16 degrees Celsius.

In the OFP equation, the mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at approach equals the heat transfer rate minus the work rate.

In the SFP equation, the mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at approach equals the heat transfer rate minus the work rate.

he equals hg at the current state, which is 2641.5 kilojoules per kilogram.

he equals hg at negative 16 degrees Celsius, which is 2537.74 kilojoules per kilogram.

The work rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 1 and enthalpy at exit.

The mass flow rate equals the work rate divided by the difference between enthalpy at state 1 and enthalpy at exit, which is 0.028 kilowatts divided by 1.0002 times 10 to the power of 5 kilograms per hour.
