The mean temperature of unsteady flow, denoted as T_UF, is equal to the difference between T2 and T1 divided by the natural logarithm of the ratio of T2 to T1. And the average temperature, denoted as T-bar, is equal to the integral of temperature T with respect to s from s_a to s_e, divided by the difference between s_e and s_a, which equals 357.9 Kelvin.
