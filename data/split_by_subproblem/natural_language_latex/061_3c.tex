The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum of the heat flow rate and the sum of the work flow rate.

The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to Q from state 1 to state 2 minus the work done by volume, W_v.

The work done, W, is the integral from state 1 to state 2 of pressure times the differential volume, which equals pressure times the difference between volume at state 2 and volume at state 1.

The volume at state 2, V_2, is equal to the mass times the gas constant times the temperature divided by the pressure.

Substituting values, the volume at state 2 is equal to 0.023 times 8.314 times 273.15 divided by 0.26629.

This calculation results in a volume of 7.109 liters.

The work done, W, is equal to 1.907 times the difference between 3.744 and 1.709, which equals 284.54 kilojoules per kilogram.

The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to the mass times the specific heat at constant volume times the change in temperature, which equals 342 grams times 0.632 times the change of 500 Kelvin, resulting in 1.08 kilojoules.

The work done, W, is equal to w minus the product of mass and entropy, which equals 284.54 times 0.00342, resulting in 0.97 kilojoules.

The heat, Q, is equal to the change in energy plus the work done, which equals 7.08 plus 0.97, resulting in 2.055 kilojoules.
