The value of U_{g,2} is unknown.

The pressure p_g is approximately equal to the equilibrium pressure p_{Ew}, which is 1.4 bar in thermodynamic equilibrium.

This implies that the equilibrium temperature T_{Ew} is 0.00 degrees Celsius.

It is evident from the table that only at a temperature of 0.00 degrees Celsius is there still a solid component in the mixture.

The internal energy at equilibrium U_{Ew} is calculated as (1 - x) times the internal energy of the fluid U_{FL} plus x times the internal energy of the solid U_{fest}.
