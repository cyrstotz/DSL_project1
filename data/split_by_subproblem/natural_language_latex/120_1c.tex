The section is titled "c)".

The equation is asking for the value of \( S_{\text{erz}} \), which is unknown.

The equation given is:
\[ 0 = \dot{m} (\text{sein - saus}) + \dot{Q}_j \frac{S_{\text{erz}}}{T_j} \]

It is rearranged to solve for \( S_{\text{erz}} \):
\[ S_{\text{erz}} = \dot{m} (\text{saus - sein}) - \frac{\dot{Q}_j}{T_j} \]

Values are provided for \( \text{saus} \) and \( \text{sein} \) at different temperatures:
\[ \text{saus} \text{ (A2 at 100°C)} = 1.3069 \]
\[ \text{sein} \text{ (A2 at 70°C)} = 0.9549 \]

Substituting these values into the equation for \( S_{\text{erz}} \):
\[ S_{\text{erz}} = 0.3 \cdot (1.3069 - 0.9549) - \frac{(-63.652)}{273 \, K} \]
The note "geschehen war" translates to "had happened".

Finally, the calculated value for \( S_{\text{erz}} \) is:
\[ S_{\text{erz}} = 0.32147 \, \text{kW} \]
