b) The average temperature of g2, denoted as T-bar g2, and the pressure at state 2, denoted as p s2.

The average temperature of g2, T-bar g2, equals the average temperature of ew2, T-bar ew2. Since there is still ice in the ice-water mix, the temperature remains at the average temperature of ew1, T-bar ew1.

T-bar g2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.

Given that volume V, mass m, and the gas constant R are constant, the ratio of pressure to temperature at state 1 equals the ratio of pressure to temperature at state 2. Therefore, the pressure at state 2, p s2, equals the product of pressure at state 1 and temperature at state 2 divided by temperature at state 1, which calculates to (140094 Pascals times 273.15 Kelvin) divided by 773.15 Kelvin.

p s2 equals 0.495 bar.
