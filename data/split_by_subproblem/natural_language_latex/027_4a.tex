The graph is described as a phase diagram with the y-axis labeled as "P" and the x-axis labeled as "T". There are three main regions labeled as "Solid", "Liquid", and "Gas". The boundary between the solid and liquid regions is marked as "isothermal" and "isobaric". The point where all three phases meet is labeled as "triple point". An arrow labeled "water curves back" points to the boundary between the liquid and gas regions. Another arrow labeled "rises at low (below triple point)" points to the boundary between the solid and liquid regions.
