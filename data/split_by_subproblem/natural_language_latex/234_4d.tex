The equation for the efficiency epsilon K is given by the ratio of the absolute value of dot Q zul over the difference between the absolute value of dot Q ab and the absolute value of dot Q zul. This is equal to the ratio of the absolute value of dot Q N1 over the difference between the absolute value of dot Q ab1 and the absolute value of dot Q N1, which is also equal to the ratio of the absolute value of dot Q N2 over the difference between the absolute value of dot Q 34 and the absolute value of dot Q N2.

Energy balance for steady flow process 12:

Zero equals dot m times the difference between h1 and h2 plus dot Q N2.

Dot Q N2 equals dot m times the difference between h2 and h1.

Dot Q 34 equals dot m times the difference between h4 and h3, which is equal to h1.

The value of epsilon K is 5.465.
