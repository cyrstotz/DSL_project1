X subscript "Eis2" is greater than zero implies T subscript "Ew2" equals T subscript "Ew1" equals zero degrees Celsius. 
Thermal equilibrium implies Q equals zero implies delta T subscript "G2" equals zero degrees Celsius equals T subscript "Ew".
p subscript "G2" implies the weight on the piston does not change.
p subscript "G2" equals p subscript "s1, A" equals 1.400342 bar.

The quote states:
Since the ice portion is greater than complete, it means that the ice kiss temperature remains the same and also in state 2 there must be no more heat flows, the second gas temperature must be zero degrees Celsius. Additionally, the pressure in the gas remains constant since the piston force remains constant.
