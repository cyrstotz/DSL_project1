The change in mass for e2 is 3600 kilograms, assumption, the change in entropy for m2 is unknown.
The mass for e2 equals the mass for e1 plus the change in mass for e2, which equals 9355 kilograms.
Entropy balance: the change in entropy for m2 equals the heat output divided by the average temperature of the cooling fluid minus the entropy for e2.
