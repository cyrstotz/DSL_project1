The change in entropy, Delta S, is equal to the heat flow rate out, Q dot aus, divided by the temperature at the cold front, T KF, plus the entropy of the cozy, S coz.

This implies that the entropy of the cozy, S coz, is equal to the change in entropy, Delta S, minus the heat flow rate out, Q dot aus, divided by the temperature at the cold front, T KF.
