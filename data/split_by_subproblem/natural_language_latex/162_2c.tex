The external specific exergy change, denoted as e-dot-sub-ext, is equal to the expression in parentheses: h-sub-six minus h-sub-zero minus T-sub-zero times the difference between S-sub-six and S-sub-zero plus k times e.

This expression can be expanded to C-sub-p times the difference between T-sub-six and T-sub-zero minus T-sub-zero times the quantity C-sub-p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T-sub-six to T-sub-zero minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of P-sub-six to P-sub-zero, plus one-half times omega-sub-six squared minus one-half times omega-sub-zero squared.

The equation continues with ellipsis, indicating further steps or simplifications not shown here.
