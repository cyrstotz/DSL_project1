Graph Description:

The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as S. The x-axis has additional labels: k over k_g K and k_g. The graph consists of a closed loop with five points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The path from point 1 to 2 is a curved line, from 2 to 3 is a straight line, from 3 to 4 is a straight line, from 4 to 5 is a wavy line, and from 5 back to 1 is a curved line.
