By the first law of thermodynamics: Q equals delta U plus p delta V minus W from 1 to 2.

The temperature of the gas is lower than T1, as it was responsible for melting the ice.

The pressure remains constant as the temperature ...

The pressure remains constant, denoted as p1,s equals p2+s, because the temperature changes but at the same time the volume also changes as the mass pushes it down.

In the equations:
- Delta U equals m times c_v times delta T by the first law of thermodynamics, where m and c_v are cancelled out.
- Q from 1 to 2 equals m times (u2 minus u1), which simplifies to m times c_v times (T2 minus T1).
- Q from 1 to 2 equals 3.6 grams times c_v times (T2 minus T1).
