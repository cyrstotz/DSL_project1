R equals the fraction of R bar over M, which equals the fraction of 83.14 over 50, resulting in 166.28 joules per kilogram Kelvin.

The fraction of downward P0 over T_PEW and the fraction of upward F over T_PEW.

P_EW equals P0 plus F times A, equals 1 bar plus m times g times the square of the fraction R over T, resulting in 1.24, 7, 6 bar.

P_g1 equals P_g equals P_EW equals 7.297 bar.

The fraction of downward P_EW over T_Pg.

pV equals mRT.

V1 equals 3.19 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.

T1 equals 773.15 Kelvin.

m1 equals the fraction of p1 times V1 over R times T1, resulting in 0.03126 kilograms.
