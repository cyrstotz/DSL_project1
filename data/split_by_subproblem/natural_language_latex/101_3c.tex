x sub 1

Zero equals m dot times the difference of h sub 4 and h sub 1, since W dot equals zero and Q dot equals zero.

h sub 4 equals h sub 1.

h sub 4 equals h sub f at 8 bar, refer to Table A-11.

h sub 4 equals 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram equals h sub 1.

h sub 1 equals h sub f plus x times the difference of h sub g and h sub f.

p sub 1 minus p sub 2, refer to Table A-10.

p sub 2 at 4 degrees Celsius equals 3.3765 bar, refer to Table A-11.

h sub f at 3.3765 bar equals the difference of h sub f at 3.6 bar and h sub f at 3.2 bar divided by the difference of 3.6 and 3.2, multiplied by the difference of 3.3765 and 3.2, plus h sub f at 3.2 bar.

h sub f equals 55.3 kilojoules per kilogram.

h sub g at 3.3765 bar equals the difference of h sub g at 3.6 bar and h sub g at 3.2 bar divided by the difference of 3.6 and 3.2, multiplied by the difference of 3.3765 and 3.2, plus h sub g at 3.2 bar.

h sub g equals 249.5072.

x equals the difference of h sub 1 and h sub f divided by the difference of h sub g and h sub f equals 0.1963 equals x sub 1.
