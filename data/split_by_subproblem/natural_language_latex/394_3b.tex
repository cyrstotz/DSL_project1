T sub a comma 1, P sub a comma 2.

States 1 and 2 are in flow equilibrium. Since the mass is not isolated, T sub a comma 1 equals T sub a comma 2.

The pressure P sub a comma 2 is equal to P sub a comma 1, as there is no change in the aforementioned force ratio. This is due to the same density of water and ice, V plus the same volume.

P sub a comma 2 equals P sub a comma 1 equals 1.4 bar.

Delta E equals Q minus W.

Since the ice-water mixture is in equilibrium with the hat always and not everything has melted yet, the hat must have already cooled down to 0 degrees Celsius, as this is thawing.
