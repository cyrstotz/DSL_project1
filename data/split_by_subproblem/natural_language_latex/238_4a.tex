The first graph described is a plot with the x-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as P in Pascals. It contains three lines:
1. A blue curve that starts from the origin, curves upwards and to the right, and is labeled "Tripel" at a point marked with a small circle and the number 2.
2. A purple straight line that starts from the origin and slopes downwards to the right.
3. A red straight line that starts from the origin and slopes upwards to the right.

The second graph described is also a plot with the x-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as P in Pascals. It contains several lines and points:
1. A blue curve that starts from the origin and curves upwards to the right.
2. A blue triangle with vertices labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, oriented such that the base is parallel to the x-axis. The base of the triangle is labeled "isobar" and the side of the triangle is labeled "isochor".
3. Arrows indicate the direction of the process along the edges of the triangle.
