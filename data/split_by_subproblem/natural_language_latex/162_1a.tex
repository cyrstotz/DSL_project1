Zero equals the mass flow rate times enthalpy h plus the heat transfer rate minus the isothermal work rate.

The heat transfer rate equals negative mass flow rate times the difference between the inlet enthalpy and the outlet enthalpy.

The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the specific heat capacity at constant pressure times the difference between the inlet temperature and the outlet temperature.

The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the specific heat capacity at constant pressure times the difference between the outlet temperature and the inlet temperature.

The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the inlet enthalpy and the outlet enthalpy, which equals 14.82 kilowatts.

The inlet enthalpy equals the enthalpy of vaporization at 200 degrees Celsius, which is 2626.8 kilojoules per kilogram.

The outlet enthalpy equals the enthalpy of vaporization at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 2676.2 kilojoules per kilogram.
