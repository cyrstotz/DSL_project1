The mass flow rate times half the square of c2 equals the change in exergy due to the stream, represented as delta e_ex_str. The change in exergy due to the stream is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference of h6 minus h0 minus T0 times the difference of s6 minus s0 plus half the square of c6 minus half the square of c0.

The difference h6 minus h0 is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference of T6 minus T0. The difference s6 minus s0 is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T6 to T0 minus the gas constant times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p6 to p0, which simplifies to the specific heat at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T6 to T0.
