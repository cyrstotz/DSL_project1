1. Heat balance at the gas:

The change in energy, delta E, equals the change in internal energy, delta U, which is equal to heat added, Q, minus the work done, delta W.

The change in internal energy, delta U, is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure for an ideal gas, c_p^ig, times the difference in temperature from T1 to T2.

The gas constant, R, is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure for an ideal gas, c_p^ig, minus the specific heat at constant volume for an ideal gas, c_v^ig.

Substituting values, R minus c_v^ig equals c_p^ig, which is calculated as 166.28 Joules per kilogram Kelvin minus 0.633 times 10 to the power of minus 3 Joules per kilogram Kelvin, resulting in c_p^ig.

The change in internal energy, delta U, is equal to the mass of the gas, m_g, times the specific heat at constant pressure for an ideal gas, c_p^ig, times the difference in temperature from T1g to T2g, and this is equal to c_12.
