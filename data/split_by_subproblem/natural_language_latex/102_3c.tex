Section c):

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is equal to the mass flow rate of the gas \( \dot{m}_{gas} \) multiplied by the specific heat at constant pressure \( c_p \) and the difference in temperature \( T_2 - T_1 \).

The specific heat at constant pressure \( c_p \) is equal to the gas constant \( R \) plus the specific heat at constant volume \( c_v \), which can be expressed as \( c_p = R + c_v = \frac{R}{M} + c_v \).

Subsection known heat removal:

The mass flow rate of the gas \( \dot{m}_{gas} \) is \( 3.6 \times 10^{-3} \) kilograms per second.

The temperature \( T_2 \) is \( 0.003 \) degrees Celsius, which equals \( 350 \) degrees Celsius.

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is calculated as \( 3.6 \times 10^{-3} \) kilograms per second multiplied by \( \left( \frac{8.314 \text{ joules per mole per Kelvin}}{50 \text{ kilograms per kilomole}} + 0.6 \text{ joules per kilogram per Kelvin} \right) \) and the temperature difference \( 0.003 \) degrees Celsius minus \( 350 \) degrees Celsius, resulting in \( -14.356 \) kilojoules per second.
