The table described has five columns and five rows. The columns are labeled P, T, x, and s. The rows are numbered from 1 to 4. The entries in the table are as follows:
- In Row 1: P equals 1, T equals negative 16 degrees Celsius, x is empty, s is empty.
- In Row 2: P equals 2, T equals negative 16 degrees Celsius, x equals 1, s is empty.
- In Row 3: P equals 8 bar, T is empty, x is empty, s is empty.
- In Row 4: P equals 8 bar, T is empty, x equals 0, s is empty.

The equations given are:
- p_i equals 1 millibar.
- T_i equals negative 10 degrees Celsius.

Under the subsection "Energy Balance Compressor (stationary flow process)":
- The equation zero equals the mass flow rate of R134a times (h_2 minus h_3) minus the power work rate.
- The power work rate equals the mass flow rate of R134a times (h_2 minus h_3).

Under the subsection "TAB A-10":
- h_2 equals h_g at negative 16 degrees Celsius, which is 237.74.
- s_2 equals s_g at negative 16 degrees Celsius, which is 0.9298 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
- s_3 equals s_3 (because it is reversible).
