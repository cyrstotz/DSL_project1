The section presents a pressure variable denoted as \( p \) in units of millibar (mbar).

The description provided is for a graph which is a pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram. The x-axis of the graph is labeled with \( T \) in degrees Celsius (°C) and the y-axis is labeled with \( p \) in millibar (mbar). The graph displays a phase diagram featuring a curve that originates from the origin and ascends non-linearly. This curve is marked as "Triple" at the point where its slope changes. Below this curve, the region is labeled as "gas," and above the curve, the region is labeled as "liquid" (flüssig in German). There are three points indicated on the graph: point 1 is on the curve, point 2 is above the curve, and point 3 is below the curve. A vertical line connecting points 1 and 2 is labeled as "isobaric" (isobare in German), and the vertical line connecting points 1 and 3 is labeled as "isothermal" (isotherm in German). The horizontal line connecting points 2 and 3 is also labeled as "isothermal." The region above the curve is labeled as "liquid" (flüssig in German) and "solid" (fest in German).

In another part, it is stated that at the complete condensation temperature \( T_q \), the pressure \( p_q \) is 8 bar, which equals 37.3 degrees Celsius. It is also noted that the throttling process is isothermal.
