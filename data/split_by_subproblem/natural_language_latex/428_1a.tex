The system is stationary.

The mass flow rate entering and leaving is 0.1 kilograms per second.

The temperature entering and leaving is 70 degrees Celsius, and both times assume ideal water.

From Table A-1: the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius is 259.88 kilojoules per kilogram and 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

Energy balance:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between entering and leaving plus the heat transfer rate.

This equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between entering and leaving plus the heat transfer rate entering plus the heat transfer rate leaving.

The heat transfer rate leaving equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between entering and leaving plus the heat transfer rate leaving.

This equals 0.1 kilograms per second times (259.88 kilojoules per kilogram minus 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram) plus 100 kilowatts.

This equals negative 62.198 kilowatts.
