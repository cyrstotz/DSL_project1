d)

The efficiency E_k is equal to the absolute value of Q dot k divided by the absolute value of W dot k, which is equal to the absolute value of Q dot divided by the absolute value of W dot.

W dot k equals 28 Watts.

Q dot k.

The partial derivative of Q dot with respect to time equals the mass flow rate m dot times the difference in enthalpy h_2 minus h_1, multiplied by Q dot k, minus W dot k raised to the power of zero.

Q dot k equals the mass flow rate m dot times the difference in enthalpy h_2 minus h_1.
