Graph Description:

The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as S in units of kJ/kgÂ·K and the y-axis labeled as T in degrees Celsius. The graph contains several lines and points:

- A line starts from the origin (0,0) and moves upwards to the right.
- Another line starts from the origin and moves upwards to the left.
- A curved line labeled 1 starts from the left line and moves upwards to the right.
- A point labeled 2 is on the curved line.
- A point labeled 3 is on the curved line further up from point 2.
- A horizontal line from point 2 to the right, labeled 0.1 bar.
- A point labeled 4 is on the right side of the graph.
- A point labeled 5 is on the left side of the graph.
- A point labeled 6 is on the left side of the graph below point 5.

The implication is that one is on the left part of the graph transitioning to the other side.
