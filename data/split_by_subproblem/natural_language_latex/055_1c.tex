The equations are as follows:

1. The difference between the output entropy, denoted as S_out, and the input entropy, denoted as S_in, equals the mass flow rate, denoted as dot m, times the difference between the entropy at the exit, S_e, and the entropy at the entrance, S_a, plus the sum of the heat transfer rate, dot Q_i, divided by the temperature, T_i, at which the heat is transferred, plus the generated entropy, S_erz.

2. The generated entropy, S_erz, equals the mass flow rate, dot m, times the difference between the entropy at the entrance, S_a, and the entropy at the exit, S_e, plus the heat transferred out, Q_aus, divided by the condensation temperature, T_KF.

3. This simplifies to 0.3 kilojoules per second times the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, C_p, times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the temperature at the entrance, T_a, to the temperature at the exit, T_e, plus the heat transferred out, Q_aus, divided by the condensation temperature, T_KF.
