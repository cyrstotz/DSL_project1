Graph Description:

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled T in Kelvin and the horizontal axis labeled S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph represents an ideal fluid.

There are six points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "irreversible", the path from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "irreversible", the path from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "isotherm", the path from point 4 to point 5 is labeled "reversible", and the path from point 5 to point 6 is labeled "reversible".

The points 1 and 6 are connected by a line labeled \( p_0 = p_6 \), and the points 4 and 5 are connected by a line labeled \( p_4 = p_5 \).
