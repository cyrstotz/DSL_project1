Graph Description: The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph consists of a curve that starts at point 0, moves to point 1, then to point 2, and continues to point 3. From point 3, it moves to point 4, and finally to point 5. The points are connected by smooth curves. The points are labeled as follows:
- Point 0 is at the origin.
- Point 1 is slightly to the right and above point 0.
- Point 2 is further to the right and above point 1.
- Point 3 is at the peak of the curve.
- Point 4 is below point 3 and to the right.
- Point 5 is further below point 4 and to the right.
