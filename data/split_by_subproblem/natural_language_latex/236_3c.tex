Energy balance (EB) on a piston:

The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum of heat flow rates into the system minus the sum of work flow rates out of the system:
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_j \dot{Q}_j - \sum_n \dot{W}_n
\]

The change in energy is the final energy minus the initial energy, which equals the sum of heat transfers into the system minus the sum of work transfers out of the system:
\[
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = \sum_j Q_j - \sum_n W_n
\]

The difference between the final and initial energy is equal to the heat transfer for the process minus the work done by the process, leading to the equation:
\[
E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W_{12} \Rightarrow Q_{12} = E_2 - E_1 + W_{12}
\]

System boundary: only gas
\[
\Delta E = Q_{12} - W_{12}
\]

Energy \(E\) is the sum of internal energy \(U\) plus two negligible terms:
\[
E = U + \cancel{E^0} + \cancel{E^0} \quad \text{(negligible)}
\]

Change in internal energy for a perfect gas:
\[
\Delta U = C_v (T_2 - T_1)
\]

Calculating the change in internal energy:
\[
= 0.633 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}} (273.15 \, \text{K} - 773.15 \, \text{K})
\]

This results in:
\[
= -316.5 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The heat transfer for the process is the change in internal energy plus the work done by the process:
\[
Q_{12} = \Delta U + W_{12} = W_{12} - 316.5 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

Graphical Description:
A simple diagram shows a piston with gas inside. The piston is represented by a rectangle with a horizontal line inside it representing the membrane. Below the membrane, the word "Gas" is written. The label "System boundary: only gas" is written next to the diagram.
