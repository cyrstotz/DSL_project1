The change in elastic strain energy, denoted as delta e subscript el,str, is equal to e subscript el,str,b minus e subscript el,str,0.

The rate of change of elastic strain energy, denoted as dot E subscript el,str, equals the mass flow rate dot m times e subscript el,str, which is equal to dot m times the expression in brackets: h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus ke plus p times e divided by rho.

The elastic strain energy, e subscript el,str, is given by h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus ke.

The initial elastic strain energy, e subscript el,str,0, is h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus ke.

The boundary elastic strain energy, e subscript el,str,b, is equal to c subscript p superscript i times (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript 0 times c subscript p superscript g times the natural logarithm of (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) plus one half times w subscript 0 squared, which equals 130065.42.

The initial elastic strain energy, e subscript el,str,0, is one half times w subscript 0 squared, which equals 20000.

The change in elastic strain energy, delta e subscript el,str, is 130065.42 minus 20000, which equals 110065.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

The temperature T subscript 6 is 340 Kelvin, the velocity w subscript 0 is 320 meters per second, and the initial temperature T subscript 0 is 293.15 Kelvin.
