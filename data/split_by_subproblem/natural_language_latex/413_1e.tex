Section c) Carnot: Theorems

Instead of a liquid zone around water:

The entropy S_e2 equals the mass flow rate dot m times the difference between the entropy s_am and s_e2, minus the sum of the heat flow rates dot Q_am and dot Q_R divided by the temperature T.

The entropy s_am equals 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, refer to Table A-2.

The entropy s_e2 equals 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, refer to Table A-2.

The heat flow rate dot Q_am equals 65 kilowatts, and the heat flow rate dot Q_R equals 100 kilowatts.

The mass flow rate dot m equals 0.3 divided by the difference between 1.3069 and 0.9549.

Section e) Entropy balance, semi-open system:

The product of mass m2 and entropy S2 minus the product of mass m1 and entropy S1 equals the change in mass delta m_12 times the entropy S_ein plus the heat Q_aus divided by the temperature T plus the entropy S_er.

The entropies S1 and S2 are from Table A-2.
