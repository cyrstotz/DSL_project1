The irreversible temperature change, denoted as T_irr, is calculated as follows:
- It is equal to the integral from initial entropy S_a to final entropy S_e of the change in energy delta e over temperature T. Here, the change in energy de is equal to the heat transfer delta Q over temperature T.
- This expression simplifies to the negative integral from S_a to S_e of dS over the difference S_a minus S_e, which further simplifies to the difference in heat q_a minus q_e over the difference in entropy S_a minus S_e, and this is equal to the difference in internal energy u_a minus u_e over the difference in entropy S_a minus S_e, specifically for ideal gases.
- This can be expressed as the specific heat at constant pressure c_p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of initial temperature T_a to final temperature T_e.
- The result of this calculation is 293.12 Kelvin.
