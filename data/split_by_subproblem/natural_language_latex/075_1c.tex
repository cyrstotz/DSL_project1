Zero equals the product of mass flow rate (m dot) and the difference between entropy at point c and entropy at point a, plus the heat transfer rate at R (Q dot R) plus the heat transfer rate out (Q dot aus).

The generated entropy (S dot erz) equals the product of mass flow rate (m dot) and the difference between entropy at point a and entropy at point e, minus the ratio of the heat transfer rate out (Q dot aus) to the temperature T_w.

The temperature T_w is approximately 850, which equals 385.15 Kelvin.

The generated entropy (S dot erz) equals the ratio of the heat transfer rate out (Q dot aus) to the temperature T_w.

The entropy at point a, s_a, is 0.54 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy at point e, s_e, is 0.5154 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The generated entropy (S dot erz) is 0.278 kilojoules per second Kelvin.
