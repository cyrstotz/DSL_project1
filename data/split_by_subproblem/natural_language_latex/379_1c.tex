The volume \( V_{G2} \) is equal to the mass \( m_{G} \) divided by the density \( \rho \), which calculates to \( 0.0071 \) cubic meters or \( 7.1 \) liters. The change in temperature \( \Delta T \) is \( 500 \) Kelvin.

Under the section "Energy Balance":
- The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is equal to the heat transfer \( \dot{Q}_{12} \) minus the work done \( W_v \).
- The change in specific internal energy \( \Delta u \) is equal to the difference in specific internal energies \( u_2 - u_1 \), which is the product of the mass of steam \( m_s \), the specific heat at constant volume \( c_v \), and the temperature difference \( T_2 - T_1 \).
- The volume work \( V_v \) is the integral of pressure \( p \) over volume \( dV \), which equals the product of pressure \( p_G \) and the change in volume \( V_2 - V_1 \).

The equation \( q + \dot{Q}_{12} \) equals the cancelled change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) plus the work done \( W_v \), which results in \( 1388.2 \) Joules, and this value is equal to \( \dot{Q}_{12} \).

The quote states that the energy balance gains on \( Q \), leading to \( Q_{12} \) approaching zero, and the heat transfer \( Q_{m2} \) is \( 1388.2 \) Joules.
