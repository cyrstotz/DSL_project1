There is a graph with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as P in bar. The graph has three regions labeled as "Gas", "Liquid", and "Solid". There is a curve separating the "Gas" and "Solid" regions, and another curve separating the "Solid" and "Liquid" regions. A point labeled "1" is in the "Gas" region, a point labeled "2" is in the "Solid" region, and a point labeled "3" is in the "Liquid" region. Arrows indicate transitions between these points: from "1" to "2" and from "2" to "3". Below the graph, there are annotations: "isobaric", "first freezes", "then sublimates", "isobaric", and "isothermal".
