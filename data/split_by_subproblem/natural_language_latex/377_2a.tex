The graph is described as a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with entropy 's' in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled with temperature 'T' in Kelvin. There are six points labeled from 0 to 5. These points are connected by different processes:
- Point 0 to Point 1 involves an isobaric process, labeled as 'p equals constant'.
- Point 1 to Point 2 involves an isentropic process, labeled as 's equals constant'.
- Point 2 to Point 3 involves an isobaric process, labeled as 'p equals constant'.
- Point 3 to Point 4 involves an isentropic process, labeled as 's equals constant'.
- Point 4 to Point 5 involves an isobaric process, labeled as 'p equals constant'.
- Point 5 to Point 6 involves an isentropic process, labeled as 's equals constant'.

Additionally, there is a small sketch in the bottom left corner showing a similar T-s diagram with a cycle labeled as "cycle process" in German.
