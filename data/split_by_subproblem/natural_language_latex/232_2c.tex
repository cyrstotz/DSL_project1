The change in heat flow at constant pressure, denoted as Delta Q dot with subscript isobar, equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 times the difference between S6 and S0, plus the change in kinetic energy, Delta ke.

This is equal to cp times the difference between T6 and T0 minus T0 times the quantity cp times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T6 to T0 minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p6 to p0, plus the change in kinetic energy, Delta ke.

This further simplifies to 1.006 times the difference between 340 and 243.15 minus 243.15 times the quantity 1.006 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 340 to 243.15 minus 0.287 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p6 to p0, plus the change in kinetic energy, Delta ke.

This expression simplifies to 1.006 times the difference between 340 and 243.15 minus 243.15 times the quantity 1.006 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 340 to 243.15 minus 0.287 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 340 to 243.15, plus half the difference between 570 and 200.

The result is 125.47 kilojoules per kilogram.

This is equivalent to 110050 Newtons.
