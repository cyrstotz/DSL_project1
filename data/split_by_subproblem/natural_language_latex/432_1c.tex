Zero equals the rate of heat transfer Q_i divided by the temperature T_KF plus the rate of entropy generation s_ez. This implies that the rate of entropy generation s_ez equals the rate of heat transfer Q_aus divided by the temperature T_KF, which equals 41.21 kilojoules per second divided by 295 Kelvin, resulting in 0.720 kilojoules per Kelvin.
