Subsection c) Entropy balance around the cooling wall

In the center, there is a diagram consisting of two horizontal lines, one above the other, with arrows pointing towards each other between these lines. The upper arrow points downwards and the lower arrow points upwards, both labeled with "Q dot out". Below the lower line, "Q dot out" is also labeled.

The equation provided is:
Zero equals Q dot out divided by T Reactor equals Q dot out divided by T KF plus S dot generated.

Section 1

Subsection c)
The equation for generated entropy S dot generated is given by:
S dot generated equals Q dot out divided by T KF minus Q dot ACS divided by T Reactor equals 62.3 kilojoules per second times (1 divided by 293 Kelvin minus 1 divided by 373.15 Kelvin).
This simplifies to 44.3 per Kelvin per second equals S dot generated.
