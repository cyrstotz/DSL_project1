S minus 3.1: the difference between the rate of entropy entering, denoted as S dot ein, and the rate of entropy leaving, denoted as S dot aus.

The rate of entropy entering, S dot ein, is equal to the rate of heat leaving, Q dot aus, divided by the reference temperature, T RF, plus the mass flow rate, m dot, times the specific entropy entering, s hat ein.

The rate of entropy leaving, S dot aus, is equal to the mass flow rate, m dot, times the specific entropy leaving, s hat aus.

The specific entropy entering, s hat ein, at 70 degrees Celsius per kilogram squared is 293.72 kilojoules per kilogram.

The specific entropy leaving, s hat aus, at 20 degrees Celsius per kilogram squared is 0.

The rate of entropy leaving, S dot aus, is equal to the mass flow rate, m dot, times the specific entropy leaving, s hat aus, plus the rate of heat leaving, Q dot aus, times the difference between the inverse of the reference temperature, 1 over T RF, and the inverse of the entering temperature, 1 over T ein.
