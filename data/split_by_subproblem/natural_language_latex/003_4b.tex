The partial derivative of E with respect to t equals the sum over i of the product of the mass flow rate at time t, denoted as dot m sub i of t, and the quantity in brackets which includes the enthalpy at time t, denoted as h sub i of t, plus half the square of the velocity at time t, denoted as v sub i squared of t, plus the product of the gravitational acceleration g and the height at time t, denoted as z sub i of t. This is added to the sum over j of the heat flow rate at time t, denoted as dot Q sub j of t, and subtracted by the sum over k of the work rate at time t, denoted as dot W sub k of t.

The work rate dot W sub u equals the product of the mass flow rate dot m and the difference between the enthalpy h sub 2 and h sub 3.

The temperature T sub 2 equals the temperature T sub 1 minus the constant C sub u.

The pressure P sub 1 equals the pressure P sub 2.

The pressure P sub 3 equals the pressure P sub 4, which is equal to the product of the mass flow rate dot m and the rate of change of velocity dot v.
