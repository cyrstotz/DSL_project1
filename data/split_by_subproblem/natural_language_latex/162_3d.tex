The change in energy, Delta E, equals the heat transfer rate, denoted as Q dot, which leads to the equation:
m2 times u2 minus m1 times u1 equals Q dot.

The internal energy u2 is expressed as:
u2 equals uf plus X times (ugg minus uf).

Substituting the expression for u2 into the first equation gives:
m2 times (uf plus X times (ugg minus uf)) equals m1 times u1 plus Q dot.

Solving for X gives:
X equals (m1 times u1 plus Q dot minus uf) divided by (m2 times (ugg minus uf)).

The internal energy ugg is not further defined in the provided text.
