Q equals the mass flow rate of water, m dot subscript w, times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet, h subscript ein, and the enthalpy at the outlet, h subscript aus, plus Q subscript aus.

Q subscript aus equals the mass flow rate of water, m dot subscript w, times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet, h subscript aus, and the enthalpy at the inlet, h subscript ein.

This equals the mass flow rate of water, m dot subscript w, times the quantity of specific heat capacity, c, times the difference in temperature from the outlet to the inlet, T subscript aus minus T subscript ein, plus the square of the velocity, v subscript i squared, times the difference in pressure from the outlet to the inlet, p subscript aus minus p subscript ein.
