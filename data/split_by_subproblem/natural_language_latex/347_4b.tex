- Refrigeration cycle process:
- State 1: Pressure \( p_1 = p_4 = 9.1 \) bar, adiabatic expansion
- State 2: Pressure \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( x = 1 \) implies just completely evaporated as gas
- State 3: Pressure \( p_3 = 8 \) bar, \( x = 3 \) adiabatic - reversible
- State 4: Pressure \( p_4 = p_3 \), \( x = 0 \) implies just condensed at 8 bar
- \( T_a = 11 \) at 8 bar
- \( T_a = 3.1 - 33^\circ \)C
- \( T_1 \) is 10 K above the sublimation point, adiabatic reversible and falls below the triple point at over 1m/s
- \( \Delta T_1 = -10^\circ \)C implies evaporator temperature \( = -16^\circ \)C implies \( -7^\circ \)C \( = T_2 \)
- State 1, 2: \( x = 1 \) implies \( T_2 = -16^\circ \)C implies \( T_{ab} = -10^\circ \)C, \( p_2 = p_3 = 2.5748 \) bar
- We have \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) and \( W_k \) of the compressor, which is adiabatic - reversible:
- \( \frac{W_{23}}{\dot{m}} = ? \) is not possible, as we do not have a polytrope.
