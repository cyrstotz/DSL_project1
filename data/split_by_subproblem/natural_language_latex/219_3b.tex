b) The temperature \( T_{EW2} \) equals the temperature \( T_{S2} \), which is \( 0^\circ C \).

There is a crossed out diagram with arrows and labels \( p_{S1} \), \( p_{S2} \), \( T_{S1} \), \( T_{S2} \).

The pressure \( p_{S2} \) equals the pressure \( p_{S1} \), which is \( 1.0401 \) bar (this is underlined).

In red text, it states "This applies, as thermodynamic equilibrium prevails."

The ratio of \( V_{S1} \) to \( V_{S2} \) is \( 1.2362 \) cubic meters per kilogram.

In red text, it states "Since the weight force and external pressure do not change."
