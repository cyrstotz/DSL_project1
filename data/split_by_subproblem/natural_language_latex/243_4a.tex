a) 

- Graph 1: A plot with the y-axis labeled as p(bar) and the x-axis labeled as T(degrees Celsius). The graph displays a dome-shaped curve. On the left side of the curve, it is labeled "liquid", in the middle "wet steam", and on the right side "steam".

- Graph 2: A plot with the y-axis labeled as p(bar) and the x-axis labeled as T(degrees Celsius). The graph shows a curve that starts from the origin and rises upwards. The curve is labeled "Liquid" on the lower part and "Steam" on the upper part. A horizontal line intersects the curve at a point labeled T_i. The intersection point is labeled "Liquid" on the left and "Steam" on the right.
