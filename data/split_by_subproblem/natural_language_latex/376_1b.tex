Q implies U.

The fraction of the integral from T_n to T_z of c_i times T with respect to T, divided by c_i times the integral from T_z to T_n of n over T with respect to T, equals the fraction of c_i times the integral from T_n to T_z of n over T with respect to T, divided by c_i times the integral from T_z to T_n of n over T with respect to T.

The mean temperature T_mK is equal to the fraction of T_z minus T_n divided by the natural logarithm of T_z over T_n, which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
