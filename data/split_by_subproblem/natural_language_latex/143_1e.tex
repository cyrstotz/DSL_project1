e) Entropy Balance:

The change in entropy, Delta S_12, equals the change in mass, Delta m_12, times the entropy at 20 degrees Celsius, plus the heat transfer Q_R,12 divided by the temperature T, plus the entropy S_12.

From Table A-2:

The entropy at 20 degrees Celsius, s(20 degrees C), equals the saturated entropy at 20 degrees Celsius, which is 0.2966.

The change in entropy, Delta S_12, equals the mass at state 2, m_2, times the entropy at state 2, s_2, minus the mass at state 1, m_1, times the entropy at state 1, s_1.

The mass at state 2, m_2, equals the mass at state 1, m_1, plus the change in mass, Delta m_12, which equals 9056 kilograms.

From Table A-2:

The entropy at state 2, s_2, equals the saturated entropy at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 0.9549.

The entropy at state 1, s_1, equals the saturated entropy at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 1.3069.

Therefore, the change in entropy, Delta S_12, equals 1726.36 kilojoules per Kelvin.
