The subsection d) contains the following equations and text:

The energy efficiency, denoted as epsilon K, is equal to the absolute value of Q zu divided by the absolute value of W k, which is also equal to the absolute value of Q k divided by the absolute value of W id.

Following this, the text "Energiebilanz" translates to "Energy balance."

The equation for Q k is given as:
Q k equals the mass flow rate of R134 (dot m subscript R134) times the difference in enthalpy h1 minus h2.

The equation continues but is incomplete, showing only:
equals 4 times an open bracket.
