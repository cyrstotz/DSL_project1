The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy at the inlet and outlet plus the heat added to the reactor minus the heat lost equals zero:
\[ \dot{m} (h_{\text{inlet}} - h_{\text{outlet}}) + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 0 \]
The heat lost is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy at the inlet and outlet plus the heat added to the reactor:
\[ \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m} (h_{\text{inlet}} - h_{\text{outlet}}) + \dot{Q}_R \]

The enthalpy at the inlet is given by the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius and quality equals infinity, which is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table A-2):
\[ h_{\text{inlet}} = h(70^\circ C, x = \infty) = 292.98 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \]
The enthalpy at the outlet is given by the enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius and quality equals zero, which is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table A-2):
\[ h_{\text{outlet}} = h(100^\circ C, x = 0) = 419.04 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \]

Therefore, the heat lost is calculated to be 62.182 reactor watts:
\[ \Rightarrow \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 62.182 \, \text{RW} \]
