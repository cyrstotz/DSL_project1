Energy balance at the compressor:

The derivative of energy E with respect to time t equals the mass flow rate m dot times the difference in enthalpy between h2 and h3 plus the power W dot.

The mass flow rate m dot equals the power W dot divided by the difference in enthalpy between h2 and h3.

The initial temperature Ti is minus 20 degrees Celsius.

This implies that the temperature T2 is minus 26 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy h2 is 231.62 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced from Table A-10.
