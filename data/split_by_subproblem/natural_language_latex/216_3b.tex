The total heat balance remains the same

The product of the total mass, specific heat capacity at constant pressure, and initial temperature plus the product of the mass of the evaporated water, specific heat capacity at constant pressure, and initial temperature equals the product of the total mass, specific heat capacity at constant pressure, and final temperature plus the product of the mass of the evaporated water, specific heat capacity at constant pressure, and final temperature.

The specific heat capacity at constant pressure is equal to the gas constant plus the specific heat capacity at constant volume, which equals 0.997 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

The mass of the evaporated water is equal to the sum of the mass of ice and the mass of water.

The mass of ice is 0.06 kilograms.

The mass of water is 0.04 kilograms.

The thermal mass of water is much higher than that of the gas. Therefore, the gas is more throaty at 0 degrees Celsius.

The saturation pressure is equal to the product of the mass, gas constant, and final temperature divided by the volume, which equals the initial pressure times the ratio of the final temperature to the initial temperature, calculated as the initial pressure times 273 divided by 773.
