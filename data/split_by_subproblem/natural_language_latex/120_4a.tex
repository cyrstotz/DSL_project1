- There are two horizontal lines intersecting the main line, labeled as "Wet steam".
- The intersection points are labeled as 1 and 2.
- A vertical line is drawn from point 2 downwards, intersecting the x-axis at point 3.
- The temperature T_i equals 10 degrees Celsius is noted on the right side of the graph.
