- A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as P and the x-axis labeled as T.
- There is a curve starting from the origin and rising upwards, labeled as "2-phase".
- Another curve starts from the top left and goes downwards, labeled as "triple".
- A horizontal line intersects the "2-phase" curve and is labeled as "sos".
- The point of intersection of the "sos" line and the "2-phase" curve is marked.
- The region below the "2-phase" curve is labeled as "liquid".
