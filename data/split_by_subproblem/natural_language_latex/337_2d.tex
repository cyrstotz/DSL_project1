For part d):

The extended exergy, denoted as \( e_{x,verl} \), is unknown.

The system is adiabatic.

The rate of change of extended exergy with respect to time, \( \frac{dE_{x,verl}}{dt} \), is equal to the change in the rate of extended exergy due to structure, \( \Delta \dot{E}_{x,str} \), plus the extended exergy \( e_{x,verl} \).

The extended exergy \( e_{x,verl} \) is equal to the change in extended exergy due to structure, \( \Delta e_{x,str} \), which is \( 116.487 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).

The exergy due to heat transfer, \( e_{x,Q} \), is zero.

The work done by the compressor, \( w_{c} \), is zero.
