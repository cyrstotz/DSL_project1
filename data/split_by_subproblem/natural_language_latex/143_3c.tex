In subtask c), the temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to 0.003 degrees Celsius.

Backside!

The items listed include:
- The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is 0.003 degrees Celsius.
- Energy balance for Gasi:
  - The change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the heat transfer at constant pressure integrated over the volume change from \( V_1 \) to \( V_2 \), which simplifies to the product of the heat transfer at constant pressure, the decrease in pressure \( p_1 \), and the volume change \( V_2 - V_1 \).
  - The volume \( V_2 \) is calculated as \( \frac{mRT_2}{p_2} \) which equals 0.007 cubic meters.
  - The change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the specific heat at constant volume \( c_v \) times the temperature difference \( T_2 - T_1 \), resulting in -316.498 kilojoules per kilogram.
  - The net heat transfer \( Q_{n2} \) is calculated as the product of mass \( m \), gravitational acceleration \( g \), and the change in internal energy \( u_2 - u_1 \) plus the product of pressure \( p_1 \) and the volume change \( V_2 - V_1 \), resulting in a total of -1700 kilojoules.
