The total change in entropy, denoted as delta s total, is equal to s2 minus s0 minus Q over T0 times the quantity s3 minus s0, plus rho times the quantity v2 minus v0. The fraction of u2 over c_p minus the fraction of u0 over c_p equals c_v times the natural logarithm of T over T0, which is equal to c_v times the quantity T0 times T2 over T0 minus T0 times the natural logarithm of T2 over T0.

The total change in entropy, delta s total, equals u2 minus u0 minus T0 times the quantity s2 minus s0, plus k times m. This is equal to c_p times the quantity T2 minus T0 minus T0 times c_p times T2 over T0 plus the difference of v0 squared minus v0 squared over 2. This results in negative m times Q over T0 times the natural logarithm of T2 over T0.
