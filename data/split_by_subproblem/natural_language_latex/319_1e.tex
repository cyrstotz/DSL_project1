The rate of change of entropy, S, with respect to time, t, is given by the sum of the product of mass flow rate, m-dot subscript i, and entropy, s subscript i, for each component i, plus the rate of heat transfer, Q-dot subscript i, divided by the temperature, T, plus the rate of entropy generation, S-dot subscript gen.

The change in entropy, Delta S, is equal to the rate of heat generation, Q-dot subscript gen, divided by the temperature, T, plus the rate of entropy generation, S-dot subscript gen.

The change in entropy from state 1 to state 2, Delta S subscript 12, is equal to the total mass, m subscript tot, multiplied by the entropy at state 2, s subscript 2, minus the mass at state 1, m subscript u, multiplied by the entropy at state 1, s subscript 1. This results in a value of 1127.26 kilojoules per Kelvin.

Notes:
- The mass at state 1, m subscript u, is 5775 kilograms.
- The internal energy at state 2, u subscript 2, at 70 degrees Celsius is 232.55 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The internal energy at state 1, u subscript 1, at 100 degrees Celsius is 448.94 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The enthalpy at state 1 to state 2, h subscript ein,12, at 20 degrees Celsius is 83.96 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The entropy at state 2, s subscript 2, at 70 degrees Celsius is 0.3549 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.
- The entropy at state 1, s subscript 1, at 100 degrees Celsius is 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.
