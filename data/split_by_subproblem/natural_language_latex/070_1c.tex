Q equals m dot times the difference of s2 and s1 plus Q dot over T0 plus s1.

Series: negative m dot times the difference of s1 and sc.

Ts equals 0.7056 minus Qu,s over T0 equals 0.7056 plus 61.182 over 273.

Equals 0.3764161 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Equals 376.39 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.

The ratio of average T over T equals the integral from s1 to s2 of T ds over the difference of s1 and s2 equals the integral from Te to Ta of c dT over the integral from Te to Ta of c over T dT equals Q over c times the natural logarithm of the ratio of Ta over Te equals epsilon times the difference of Ta and Te over c times the natural logarithm of the ratio of Ta over Te equals the difference of Ta and Te over the natural logarithm of the ratio of Ta over Te.
