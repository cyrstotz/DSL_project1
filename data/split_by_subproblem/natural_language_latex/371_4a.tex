Graph Description:

The graph is a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled T [K] (temperature in Kelvin) and the y-axis is labeled p [bar] (pressure in bar).

- The graph starts with a line rising from the origin, representing the phase boundary between the liquid and vapor phases.
- The line curves upwards and then downwards, forming a dome shape, which represents the saturation curve.
- Inside the dome, the region is labeled as "wet steam" (Nassdampf).
- To the left of the dome, the region is labeled as "saturated liquid" (gesättigte Flüssigkeit).
- To the right of the dome, the region is labeled as "saturated vapor" (gesättigter Dampf).
- A horizontal line is drawn inside the dome, representing an isotherm, and is labeled as "isotherm".
- The left end of the isotherm is labeled as "1" and the right end as "2".
- Another horizontal line is drawn above the dome, representing another isotherm, and is labeled as "isotherm".
- The left end of this isotherm is labeled as "3".
