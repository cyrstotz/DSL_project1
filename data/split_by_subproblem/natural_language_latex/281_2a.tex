The content describes a graph of T versus S. The y-axis is labeled T with units u/kg, and the x-axis is labeled S with units u/(kgÂ·K). There are two isobaric lines on the graph labeled "Isobare 2,3" and "Isobare 4,5". Additionally, there are two isentropic lines labeled "s=const". The points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are marked on the graph. The points 1 and 2 are connected by a vertical line labeled "s=const", and the points 4 and 5 are also connected by a vertical line labeled "s=const". The points 2 and 3 are connected by a curved line labeled "Isobare 2,3", and the points 4 and 5 are connected by a curved line labeled "Isobare 4,5".
