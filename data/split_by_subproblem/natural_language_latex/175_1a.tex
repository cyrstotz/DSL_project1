a) stationary:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the sum of the enthalpy entering minus the enthalpy exiting, plus the heat flow exiting, minus the heat flow due to radiation, minus the work entering.

The heat flow exiting equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy entering and the enthalpy exiting.

The mass flow rate is 0.13 kilograms per second.

Refer to Table A2 for the enthalpy entering.

With the vapor enthalpy entering being 2333.8 kilojoules per kilogram, and the vapor enthalpy exiting being 2257.0 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat flow exiting equals 0.13 kilograms per second times the difference between 2333.8 kilojoules per kilogram and 2257.0 kilojoules per kilogram, minus 100 kilojoules per second.

This equals 76.96 kilowatts.
