S1 equals the product of m_ges1 and S_T_rechter1, which equals 5755 times 1.3069, resulting in 7521.205.
S2 equals the product of the sum of m_ges1 and Delta m12, and S_T_rechter2, which equals the sum of 5755 and 3600 times 0.9549, resulting in 8933.0895.
Therefore, Delta S12 equals S2 minus S1, which equals 1411.88 kilojoules per Kelvin.
