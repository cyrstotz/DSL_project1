1. Left-hand side of the compressor:
   - The equation is zero equals m dot times (h2 minus h1) minus V dot subscript u.
   - m dot equals V dot subscript u divided by (h2 minus h1).
   - T2 minus T1 equals 6, which is calculated as 273.15 minus 10 minus 6 equals 259.15 Kelvin, which is minus 76 degrees Celsius.
   - h2 equals h of (x equals 0, T2) equals 234.08 kilojoules per kilogram.
   - x equals 0.33845.
