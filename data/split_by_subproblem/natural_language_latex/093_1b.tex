The average temperature T-bar is given by the equation:
T-bar equals the integral from e to a of T ds, divided by the difference S_a minus S_e.

For the material model of an ideal fluid:
The difference S(T_d) minus S(T_e) equals the integral from T_e to T_d of c_if times dT over T minus c_if times the natural logarithm of the ratio T_d over T_e.

The integral from e to a of T ds equals the integral from T_e to T_a of c_if dT.

Entropy balance:
The rate of mass flow times entropy at point 2 minus the rate of mass flow times entropy at point 1 equals the sum of the rate of mass flow times entropy at point i plus the sum of the heat transfer rate over temperature at point i plus S_er.
