V2 equals m R T2 over p2, which equals 0.0011 cubic meters.

V1 equals 0.003 cubic meters.

W equals the integral from V1 to V2 of p dV, since it is isobaric, this equals (V2 minus V1) times p, which equals 0.002 times 1.1 times 10 to the power of 5 Joules.

Delta U equals U2 minus U1, which equals Q minus W.

Q equals U2 minus U1 plus W.

u2 minus u1 equals m times c_v times (T2 minus T1), which equals 0.9 times negative 850.521.

Q_g,2 equals negative Q, which equals 1.093 kilojoules.
