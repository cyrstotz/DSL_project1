The first graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as "1 over V kg per kJ" and the y-axis is unlabeled. There are several points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The points are connected by lines with arrows indicating the direction of the process. The process starts at point 0, moves to point 1, then to point 2, and so on until point 6. The line from point 0 to point 1 is labeled "isentropic". The line from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isotherm". The line from point 4 to point 5 is labeled "isentropic". The line from point 5 to point 6 is labeled "isotherm".

The second graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as "1 over V kg per kJ" and the y-axis labeled as "T in Kelvin". There are several points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The points are connected by lines with arrows indicating the direction of the process. The process starts at point 0, moves to point 1, then to point 2, and so on until point 6. The line from point 0 to point 1 is labeled "isentropic". The line from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isobar". The line from point 4 to point 5 is labeled "isobar". The line from point 5 to point 6 is labeled "isotherm".
