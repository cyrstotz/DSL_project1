w_5 equals 220 meters per second,
p_5 equals 0.5 bar,
T_5 equals 431.9 Kelvin,
w_6 equals 2,
p_6 equals 0.191 bar,
T_6 equals 2,
T_6 equals T_5 times the ratio of p_6 over p_5 raised to the power of (n minus 1) over n,
T_6 equals 293.9 Kelvin,
n equals k equals 1.4.

Energy equation:
0 equals the mass flow rate of gas times (h_5 minus h_6 plus half the difference of w_6 squared minus w_5 squared),
h_5 minus h_6 equals the specific heat at constant pressure of ideal gas times (T_5 minus T_6),
0 equals the mass flow rate of gas times (the specific heat at constant pressure of ideal gas times (T_5 minus T_6) plus half the difference of w_6 squared minus w_5 squared),
negative half the difference of w_5 squared minus w_6 squared equals the specific heat at constant pressure of ideal gas times (T_5 minus T_6).

w_6 squared equals 2 times the specific heat at constant pressure of ideal gas times (T_5 minus T_6) plus w_5 squared,
w_6 equals 220.63 meters per second.
