The graph described is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled as temperature in Kelvin. The graph consists of six points labeled from 1 to 6. These points are connected by various curves and lines, indicating different thermodynamic processes:

- From Point 1 to Point 2, there is an isentropic process represented by a vertical line.
- From Point 2 to Point 3, there is an isobaric process represented by a curved line.
- From Point 3 to Point 4, there is another isobaric process represented by a curved line.
- From Point 4 to Point 5, there is an isentropic process represented by a vertical line.
- From Point 5 to Point 6, there is an isobaric process represented by a curved line.
- From Point 6 to Point 1, there is an isentropic process represented by a vertical line.

The graph also includes annotations indicating the nature of the processes, whether they are isobaric or isentropic, and a note that the pressure at Point 3 equals the initial pressure, indicating an isobaric process.
