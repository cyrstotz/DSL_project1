The rate of change of internal energy, denoted as E-dot subscript u, equals the rate of heat transfer, Q-dot subscript zu, divided by the product of the mass flow rate, m-dot, and the enthalpy, h subscript f. This results in E-dot subscript u equals 156.28 Watts divided by 6.894 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 5.581.

Underlined 156.28 Watts.

The heat transfer rate, Q, equals the product of the mass flow rate, m-dot, and the difference in enthalpy from h subscript 2 to h subscript 1, plus the rate of heat transfer into the system, Q-dot subscript zu. This leads to Q-dot subscript zu equals the product of the mass flow rate, m-dot, and the enthalpy difference from h subscript 2 to h subscript 1, which equals 156.28 Watts.

Underlined 156.28 Watts.
