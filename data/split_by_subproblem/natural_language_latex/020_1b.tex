The average kinetic temperature, denoted as T-bar KE, is calculated as follows:
The integral from S-a to S-e of T dS divided by (S-e minus S-a) equals (h2 minus h1) divided by (S2 minus S1), which equals Cp times (T2 minus T1) divided by Cp times the natural logarithm of (T2 divided by T1). This implies that:
T-bar KE equals (298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin) divided by the natural logarithm of (298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin), which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
