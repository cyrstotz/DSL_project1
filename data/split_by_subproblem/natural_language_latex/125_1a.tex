1. Main Principle

Zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy in and the enthalpy out plus the heat transfer rate into the system minus the heat transfer rate out of the system.

The heat transfer rate out of the system equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 283.88 kilojoules per kilogram and 493.04 kilojoules per kilogram plus 100 kilowatts, which equals negative 62.18 kilowatts.
