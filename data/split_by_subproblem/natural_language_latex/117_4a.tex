The graph described is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The horizontal axis is labeled as T in Kelvin and the vertical axis is labeled as P in unspecified units. The graph features a closed loop with four points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isentropic", the path from point 2 to point 3 and from point 3 to point 4 are both labeled "isobaric". The path from point 4 back to point 1 is not labeled. The curve connecting points 1 and 4 is smooth, whereas the paths connecting points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are straight lines. Additionally, a point labeled "ND" is marked on the horizontal axis near the end of the curve.
