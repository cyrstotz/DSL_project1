- A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as T (degrees Celsius) and the y-axis labeled as p (bar).
- The graph shows three distinct regions labeled as "Ice", "Liquid", and "Gas".
- There is a line separating the "Ice" and "Liquid" regions, and another line separating the "Liquid" and "Gas" regions.
- The intersection of these lines is labeled as "Triple Point".
- A point on the line from "Ice" to "Liquid" is labeled as "T".
- Another point on the line from "Liquid" to "Gas" is labeled as "Z".
