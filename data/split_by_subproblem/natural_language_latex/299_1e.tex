The change in entropy between state 1 and state 2, denoted as delta s 12, equals s2 minus s1, which equals the mass flow rate from state 1 to state 2, denoted as m dot 12, times the difference in entropy between state 2 and state 1, which equals the mass flow rate from state 1 to state 2, denoted as m dot 12, times the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature T2 to temperature T1. The temperatures are given as T2 equals 760 degrees Celsius and T1 equals 20 degrees Celsius.
