The density rho times the volume V equals mass m times the gas constant R times the temperature T.
The mass m subscript 3 equals the mass m subscript 1.
The pressure p subscript 1 comma 3 equals the pressure p subscript 2 comma g equals 1.4 bar (the pressure through the pane and weight remains unchanged).
The internal energy U subscript g equals the internal energy U subscript EW.
