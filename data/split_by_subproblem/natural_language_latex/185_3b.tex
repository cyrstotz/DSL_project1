i) 
- There is a graph with the y-axis labeled as T and the x-axis labeled as P in bar.
- The y-axis has three points labeled T2, Ta, and TKD from bottom to top.
- There are three curves on the graph:
  - The first curve starts from the bottom left and curves upwards to the right, passing through point a.
  - The second curve starts from the bottom left and curves upwards to the right, passing through point b.
  - The third curve starts from the bottom left and curves upwards to the right, passing through point c.
- Points a, b, and c are marked on the graph.

ii)
- There is a graph with the y-axis labeled as P in bar and the x-axis labeled as T in Kelvin.
- There are two curves on the graph:
  - The first curve starts from the bottom left and curves upwards to the right, passing through point 1.
  - The second curve starts from the bottom left and curves upwards to the right, passing through point 2.
- Points 1, 2, A, and B are marked on the graph.
- There are arrows indicating isobaric processes between points 1 and A, and between points 2 and B.
