Energy balance around the blade outlet (stationary) leads to:

h5 plus (w5 squared divided by 2) equals h6 plus (w6 squared divided by 2).

h5 (solvable, 431.9K) equals

implies h5 equals h of T5 equals h of 431.9K.

Table A-22 implies h of 430K plus (h of 440K minus h of 430K) divided by (440 minus 430)K times (431.9 minus 430)K.

Interpolation implies (h of 440K minus h of 430K) divided by (440 minus 430)K times (431.9 minus 430K) plus h of 430K.

Table A-22 implies (449.61 minus 431.93) kJ/kg divided by 10K times 1.9K plus 431.93 kJ/kg.

equals 433.37 kJ/kg equals h5.

h6 equals h of 340K implies Table A-22 equals 340.42 kJ/kg.
