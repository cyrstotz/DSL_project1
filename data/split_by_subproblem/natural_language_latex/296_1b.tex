Zero equals the product of m dot times the difference of h sub e minus h sub a plus the fraction of Q dot over T.

The fraction of Q dot over T equals the product of m dot times the difference of s sub a minus s sub e.

T bar equals the fraction of Q dot over the product of m dot times the difference of s sub a minus s sub e.

T bar equals the fraction of the integral of T dS over the difference of s sub a minus s sub e, which equals the fraction of T sub 2 minus T sub 1 over the natural logarithm of the fraction of T sub 2 over T sub 1.

This equals 293.102 Kelvin.
