Energy balance of the compressor:

The equation zero equals m dot times the difference of h2 and h3 minus W dot subscript k.

m dot equals W dot subscript k divided by the difference of h2 and h3.

Assumption: T equals 10 degrees Celsius.

h2 equals h of 10 degrees Celsius, X equals 0.

Interpolation:

h2 equals 233.63 minus 237.46 times the fraction with numerator 92545 minus 0.2354 and an unspecified denominator.
