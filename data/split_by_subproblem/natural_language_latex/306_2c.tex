The equations are as follows:

The difference between e subscript x, ist,6 and e subscript x, ist,0 equals h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times the difference between s subscript 6 and s subscript 0 plus half of w subscript 6 squared.

This equals c subscript p,l times the difference between T subscript 6 and T subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times c subscript p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T subscript 6 to T subscript 0 plus half of w subscript 6 squared.

This equals 1.006 times the difference between 328.07 and 293.15 minus 293.15 times 1.006 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 328.07 to 293.15 plus half of 320 squared times one over ten to the power of three.

This results in 192.2 kilojoules per kilogram.
