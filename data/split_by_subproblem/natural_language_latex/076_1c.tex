Entropy balance at the control command:

Zero equals the heat flow rate out divided by the temperature out minus the heat flow rate from the cooling fluid divided by the cooling fluid temperature plus the generated entropy rate.

The generated entropy rate equals the absolute heat flow rate out times the difference between the reciprocal of the cooling fluid temperature and the reciprocal of the temperature out.

The temperature out is 100 degrees Celsius, which is 373.15 Kelvin.

The generated entropy rate equals 62.5 kilowatts times the difference between the reciprocal of 293.12 and the reciprocal of 373.15, which results in approximately 0.570 Watts per Kelvin.
