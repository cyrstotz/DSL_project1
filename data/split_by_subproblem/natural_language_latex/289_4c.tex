The mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, equals the heat flow rate at k2, denoted as Q dot subscript k2, divided by h.

The temperature T2 is negative 22 degrees Celsius and the quality x2 is unknown.

The term "isenthalp" indicates that h subscript q equals h subscript 1.

The difference in enthalpy at 8 bar for h subscript q and h subscript g is 264.77 kilojoules per kilogram.
