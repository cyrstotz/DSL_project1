The change in internal energy, denoted as Delta U, is equal to the heat added, Q, minus the work done, W. Since the process is isochoric, the work done, W, is zero. The internal energy change between two states, u2 and u1, is equal to Q. It is given that u2 equals u1.

The change in heat per mass, Delta Q over m, is equal to the change in internal energy, Delta u, times 0.003 plus x2 times the difference between hk2 and hk1, where h equals u plus pv. The change in heat per mass is also given as negative 200.1 minus u1 times 0.003 minus x2 times the ratio of the difference between uk2 and u1 to the difference between uk1 and u1. Solving for x2, it is found that x2 equals 56.96 percent.

The ratio of the mass of ice, mEis, to the mass of water, mW, is 0.6, which implies that 60 percent is ice.

The total energy change, Delta E_tot, is calculated as xEis times the difference between hk2 and hEis1, which equals Delta E of x1. The total energy change minus xEis times the difference between the total energy change and Delta E_Eis1 equals Delta E of x1. The final expression simplifies to negative 200.1 times u4 over v.
