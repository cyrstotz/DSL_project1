The equation for \( X_{EIS} \) is given by the fraction where the numerator is \( \Theta - \Theta_f \) and the denominator is \( \Theta_g - \Theta_f \). This can be rewritten as \( \frac{u_2 - u_f}{u_g - u_f} \), which equals \( \frac{-185.090 \frac{kJ}{kg} + 335.458 \frac{kJ}{kg}}{u_g - u_f} \).

**State 1**

The mass of ice is \( 0.06 \, kg \) and the mass of water is \( 0.09 \, kg \).

The internal energy \( u_1 \) is calculated as \( -335.458 \frac{kJ}{kg} \times 0.06 \, kg - 0.045 \frac{kJ}{kg} \times 0.09 \, kg \), which equals \( -20.009 \, kJ \).

The heat transfer \( Q_m \) is equal to the change in internal energy \( \Delta U \), which is \( u_2 - u_1 \).

The internal energy \( u_2 \) is then calculated as \( Q_m + u_1 = -185.097 - 20.0097 = -185.097 \, kJ \).

Finally, \( u_2 \) is also given by \( \frac{u_m}{m} = \frac{-185.090 \, kJ}{kg} \).
