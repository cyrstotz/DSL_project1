A horizontal line with the text "relative unit" is crossed out.

Below it, there is a horizontal line with arrows pointing to the right at both ends. Above the line, there are the following labels:
- h3 minus hf
- A-8
- 269.09 minus 63.53
- 1.07

Below the line, there are the following labels:
- hg minus hf
- xs
- 255.05 minus 63.53

The equation is given as:
x1 equals the fraction (h1 minus hf) over (hg minus hf), labeled A-8.
