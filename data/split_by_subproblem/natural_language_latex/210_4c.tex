x_n after throttle

A diagram of a throttle is drawn with an inlet and an outlet. The inlet is labeled with 8 bar and an arrow pointing into the throttle. The outlet is labeled with p1 equals p2 and an arrow pointing out of the throttle. The points before and after the throttle are labeled as "4" and "1" respectively.

phi equals phi_f plus x times (phi_g minus phi_f)

Throttle isenthalpic

implies h4 equals h1

h4 equals 264.15

x equals (h4 minus h_f1) divided by (h_g1 minus h_f1) equals (264.15 minus 253.43) divided by (272.02 minus 253.43)

h_g of p1 equals h_f of p4

h_f from AB at 8 bar equals 264.15
