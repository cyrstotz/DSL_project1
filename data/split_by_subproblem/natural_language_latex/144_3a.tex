a) 
The area A is equal to the square of the diameter D divided by 2, all squared, times pi, which equals 0.00785 square meters.
The pressure P_K is equal to the mass m times gravity g divided by the area A, which equals 39990 Pascals or 33.25 kiloPascals.
The evaporative pressure P_EW is approximately 6.108 kiloPascals (referenced from TAB A-6).
The sum of the pressure P_G and the evaporative pressure P_EW equals the pressure P_K plus the ambient pressure P_amb.
Therefore, the pressure P_G equals the pressure P_K plus the ambient pressure P_amb minus the evaporative pressure P_EW, which equals 1.394 bar.
