a) p_g1 equals question mark.

C_v equals 0.63 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

M equals 50 kilograms per kilomole.

p equals mRT divided by V.

This implies p_g1 is the back pressure to gas water and environment.

p_g equals p_amb plus mg plus m_ew times g.

This equals 100000 plus 32 times 9.81.

A equals r squared times pi.

This equals 0.1 squared times pi equals 0.031416 square meters.

This equals (100000 plus 10000) divided by 0.0314 Pascals.

This equals 1.1 bar equals p_g1.

m_g equals pV divided by RT.

This equals (110000 times 0.0314) divided by (8394 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin times (500 plus 273.15 Kelvin)).

This equals approximately 0.2687 kilograms equals m_g.

This equals 0.2687 grams.
