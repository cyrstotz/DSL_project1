Statistical fixed point: zero equals the rate of exergy input plus the quantity one minus the ratio of T0 over T times the rate of heat input minus the rate of work output minus the rate of exergy output.

The total rate of work, W dot subscript t, equals the sum of the rate of work by the turbine, W dot subscript turb, and the rate of work by the pre-process, W dot subscript vor.

The rate of work by the turbine, W dot subscript turb, equals the fraction where the numerator is h2 minus h1 plus half the difference of omega2 squared minus omega1 squared plus q subscript B, and the denominator is c subscript p times the difference T2 minus T0.
