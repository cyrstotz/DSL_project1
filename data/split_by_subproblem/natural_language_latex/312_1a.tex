a) Stationary flow process:

Zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy in and the enthalpy out, plus the heat transfer rate into the system minus the heat transfer rate out of the system.

The heat transfer rate out of the system equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy in and the enthalpy out, plus the heat transfer rate into the system.

The enthalpy in minus the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius with quality x equals zero is equal to the saturated liquid enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy out is equal to the enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius with quality x equals zero, which is the saturated liquid enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius, equal to 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat transfer rate out of the system is equal to 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram and 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram, plus 100 kilowatts.

This equals 62.18 kilowatts.
