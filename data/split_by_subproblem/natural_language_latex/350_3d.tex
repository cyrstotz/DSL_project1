The equation x sub 4 times m equals 0.6 kilograms minus 0.1 kilograms equals 0.06 kilograms equals m sub res.

I continue with given values:

The equation p sub 2 equals p sub 4 equals 1.5 bar leads to u sub fest at 1.5 bar.

Internal energy is conserved in the entire system:

Delta U equals zero equals m sub L times (U sub L2 minus U sub L1) plus m sub EW times (U sub 2 minus U sub 1).
Delta U equals m sub L times (U sub L2 minus U sub L1) plus m sub EW times (U sub 2 minus U sub L1) equals zero.

Find U sub 1 interpolated from Table 1: U sub fest minus 1.

The equation U sub 1 equals U sub p plus 0.6 times (U sub g minus U sub f).

Graphical content:

There is a graph with a horizontal axis labeled from 333.498 to 333.638. The graph shows a curve that starts at 333.498 and ends at 333.638.

The equation (U sub 2L minus U sub L1) equals C sub V times (T sub 2 minus T sub 1).
C sub V equals C sub p divided by R (crossed out), C sub V equals.

At 1.9 bar, interpolate to obtain U sub 1.
At 2.0 bar, to obtain.
