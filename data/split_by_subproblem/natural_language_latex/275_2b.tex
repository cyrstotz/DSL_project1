The rate of shaft work, denoted as W dot subscript s, equals zero.
The change in energy, denoted as dE, equals the total mass flow rate, denoted as m dot subscript ges, times the difference in enthalpy from state 5 to state 6, plus the heat transfer rate, denoted as Q dot, minus the work rate, denoted as W dot, and this equals zero.
The temperature at point B, denoted as T subscript B, equals the temperature at state 5, denoted as T subscript 5, times the ratio of the base pressure, denoted as p subscript 0, to the pressure at state 5, denoted as p subscript 5, raised to the power of (k minus 1) divided by k, and this equals 328.07 Kelvin.
The change in energy, denoted as dE, equals zero.
The total mass flow rate, denoted as m dot subscript ges, times the sum of the difference in enthalpy from state 5 to state 6 and the difference in kinetic energy per unit mass from state 5 to state 6, plus the heat transfer rate, denoted as Q dot, minus the work rate, denoted as W dot, equals zero.
The square root of half the square of the velocity at state 5 minus the difference in enthalpy from state 6 to state 5 equals the velocity at state 6, which equals 507.25 meters per second.
The difference in enthalpy from state 6 to state 5 equals the specific heat at constant pressure, denoted as c subscript p, times the change in temperature, denoted as Delta T.
