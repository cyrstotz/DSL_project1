The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum of the mass flow rate in times the sum of enthalpy, kinetic energy, and potential energy at the entrance, plus the sum of heat transfer, minus the sum of work done.

The product of area and overall heat transfer coefficient between state 1 and 2 equals the heat transfer at the entrance minus the work done between state 1 and 2.

The product of mass and the change in internal energy equals the heat transfer between state 1 and 2 minus the work done between state 1 and 2.

The product of mass, specific heat at constant volume, and the temperature difference between state 2 and state 1 equals the heat transfer between state 1 and 2 minus the product of initial pressure and the change in volume.

The change in volume is equal to the ratio of the volume at state 1 over the temperature at state 1 times the volume at state 1 over the temperature at state 2.

The change in volume is boxed and equals negative 2.0306 liters.

The temperature at state 2 for gas 1 is boxed and equals 0.003 degrees Celsius.
