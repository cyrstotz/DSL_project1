Section d) Task

List:
- T1 equals 100 degrees Celsius
- T2 equals 70 degrees Celsius
- Tein,12 equals 70 degrees Celsius

Energy balance for a semi-open system:

The change in energy (Delta E) is equal to the mass flow rate of fluid 2 times the internal energy of fluid 2 (m dot 2 times u2) minus the mass flow rate of fluid 1 times the internal energy of fluid 1 (m dot 1 times u1) plus the change in kinetic energy (Delta KE) plus the change in potential energy (Delta PE). This equals negative xi times the mass flow rate of fluid i times the sum of the enthalpy of fluid i (h_i), half the square of the velocity of fluid i (w_i squared divided by 2), plus the product of the gravitational acceleration (g) and the height (z_i), plus the sum of heat transfer rates (Q dot j) minus the sum of work rates (W dot k).
