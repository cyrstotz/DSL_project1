The content describes a graph of temperature T (in Kelvin) on the y-axis versus entropy S (in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) on the x-axis. The graph starts at point 0 and moves to point 1, then to point 2, 3, 4, 5, and finally to point 6. There are dashed lines indicating isobars: P1 equals P5 equals P4 and P2 equals P3. The points are connected with straight lines, forming a closed loop. The label P0 equals P6 is written near point 6. The word "Isobars" is written near the dashed lines.
