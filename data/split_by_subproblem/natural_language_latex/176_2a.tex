- The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram.
- The y-axis is labeled as T in Kelvin.
- The x-axis is labeled as S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
- The graph starts at point O at 243.15 Kelvin on the y-axis.
- From point O, a vertical line goes up to point 1.
- From point 1, a line goes to the right and slightly up to point 2.
- From point 2, a line goes up to point 3.
- From point 3, a line goes down to point 4 labeled as "adiabatic".
- From point 4, a line goes down to point 5 labeled as "Mixing isentropic".
- From point 5, a line goes down to point 6.
- From point 6, a line goes back to point O labeled as "isothermal".
- There is a dashed line from point O to point 6 labeled as P0/P6.
