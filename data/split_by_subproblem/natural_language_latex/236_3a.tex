Ideal Gas Law: \( pV = nRT \)

Force equilibrium state 1:

In the center, a diagram is depicted with multiple vectors and lines arranged vertically, indicating forces acting in opposite directions at various levels.

For task 3, subtask a:

The mass of the gas, \( M_g \), is calculated as follows:
\[ 
M_g = \frac{140.14 \, \text{kPa} \cdot 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3}{0.166 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K}} = 3.43 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} = 3.43 \, \text{g}
\]

The rate of change of state for ice, \( \dot{x}_{\text{Eis,1}} \), is 0.6.

From subtask b): The pressure \( P_{g2} \) is 49.56 kPa, which is approximately 0.4956 bar, roughly equal to 0.5 bar.

Energy balance around the ice:

In a closed system:
\[ 
\frac{dE}{dt} = Q - \dot{W} \rightarrow \text{Volume does not change}
\]

Change in energy is the sum of changes in internal energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy:
\[ 
\Delta E = \Delta U + \Delta KE + \Delta PE = U_2 - U_1
\]

Internal energy \( U_1 \) for ice at \( x_1 = 0.6 \) and \( T=0 \) is read from Table 1:
\[ 
U_1 = U_f + x \cdot (U_g - U_f)
\]
Where \( U_g \) is the internal energy of gas and \( U_f \) is the internal energy of liquid:
\[ 
= U_f + x U_g - x U_f
\]
\[ 
= [0.1045 + 0.6 \cdot (-333.458 + 0.045)] \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
\[ 
= -200.093 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \approx -200.1 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]

The change in internal energy from \( U_1 \) to \( U_2 \) due to heat transfer \( Q_{12} \):
\[ 
U_2 - U_1 = Q_{12} \Rightarrow U_2 = Q_{12} + m \cdot U_{\text{1 spez}}
\]
\[ 
U_2 = 1500 \text{ J} + 0.1 \text{ kg} \cdot (-200.1 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}})
\]
\[ 
= 1500 \text{ J} - 20.01 \text{ kJ} = 1500 \text{ J} - 20010 \text{ kJ}
\]
\[ 
= -18510 \text{ J}
\]
\[ 
U_2 = \frac{-18510 \text{ J}}{0.1 \text{ kg}} = -185100 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}} = -185.100 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
\]
