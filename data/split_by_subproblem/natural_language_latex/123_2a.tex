Graph Description: The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled 'S (kJ/kgÂ·K)' and the y-axis labeled 'T [K]'. There are two curves on the graph. The lower curve is labeled "adiabatic compressor" and the upper curve is labeled "isobars". Both curves start from the same point on the x-axis. The upper curve is steeper than the lower curve. There is a vertical arrow between the two curves indicating a process from the lower curve to the upper curve. The upper curve is labeled 'p_5' and the lower curve is labeled 'p_0/p_6'.
