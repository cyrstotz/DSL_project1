Energy balance around the throttle:
The equation Q equals zero, w equals zero, implies h sub four equals h sub one.

For item 4d, the kinetic energy efficiency epsilon sub K is equal to the absolute value of Q sub zu divided by the absolute value of Q sub ab minus the absolute value of Q sub zu, which simplifies to the absolute value of Q sub zu divided by the absolute value of W sub t.
