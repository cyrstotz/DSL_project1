- Graph: T-S Diagram
- The x-axis is labeled as s and the y-axis is labeled as T.
- There is a curve starting from point 0 to point 1, labeled as "isentropic, T1".
- From point 1 to point 2, the curve is labeled as "mk = isentropic, T2".
- From point 2 to point 3, the curve is labeled as "ink = isobar T3".
- From point 3 to point 4, the curve is labeled as "mk = irreversible Turbine".
- From point 4 to point 5, the curve is labeled as "mk + mk = isobar".
- From point 5 to point 6, the curve is labeled as "isotherm".
- The curve from point 0 to point 1 is marked as "isentropic".
- The curve from point 1 to point 2 is marked as "isentropic".
- The curve from point 2 to point 3 is marked as "isobar".
- The curve from point 3 to point 4 is marked as "irreversible Turbine".
- The curve from point 4 to point 5 is marked as "isobar".
- The curve from point 5 to point 6 is marked as "isotherm".
- There is a note: "Sorry, German salad in my head, I mean isentropic".

The inequality T0 is greater than TA, and s0 is greater than s1.

s in units of per kilogram.
