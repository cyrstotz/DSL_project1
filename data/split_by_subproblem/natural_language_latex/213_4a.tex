a) The description includes:

- A graph with the y-axis labeled as p (pressure) in bar and the x-axis labeled as T (temperature) in Kelvin.
- The graph displays a curve that begins at the origin and ascends, representing the saturation line.
- The area to the left of the curve is labeled as "Solid", and the area to the right of the curve is labeled as "Fluid".
- There are three points marked on the graph: 1, 2, and 3.
- Point 1 is located at a higher pressure and temperature, and it is connected to point 2 by a vertical line labeled "Isobar".
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 by a horizontal line labeled "Isotherm".
- Point 3 is positioned on the saturation line.
- The distance between the points on the x-axis is noted as 10 Kelvin.
