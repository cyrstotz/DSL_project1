Since no additional force is added, the process in the cylinder is isobaric and therefore \( P_{23} = P_{1g} = 1.4 \text{ bar} \).

Since we are still in the ice water phase, in state 2 \( T_{2w} = T_{1w} = 0^\circ C \) and it reaches thermal equilibrium. Therefore, \( T_{2w} = T_{2g} = 0^\circ C \).
