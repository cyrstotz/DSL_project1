The average temperature T-bar is equal to the integral from s-e to s-a of T ds, divided by s-a minus s-e, which equals 298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by s-a minus s-e.

s-a equals s-f plus x-D times the difference between s-g and s-f, which is equation A-2, and equals 1.337.

The average temperature T-bar equals 298.15 minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by 0.1549 minus 1.337 in units of kilojoules per kilogram-Kelvin, which equals negative 26.17 Kelvin.
