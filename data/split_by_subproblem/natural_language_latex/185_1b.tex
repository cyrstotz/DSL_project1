The average temperature T-bar subscript KF equals the integral from T2 to T3 of T dS divided by S3 minus S2, which equals the fraction (T2 minus T3) over the natural logarithm of (T2 divided by T3), minus the fraction (238.15 minus 285.15) over the natural logarithm of (292.15 divided by 288.15). This implies that 293.12 equals T-bar subscript KF.
