Energy balance around reactor fluid:
The mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat flow rate out, plus the heat flow rate in, equals zero:
\[ \dot{m} (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}}) + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} + \dot{Q}_{\text{in}} = 0 \]
Plugging in the values:
\[ 0.3 (292.98 - 4128.23) + \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} + 100 = 0 \]
The enthalpy at the outlet is calculated as:
\[ h_{\text{out}} = 0.005 \times 2257 + (1 - 0.005) \times 249.04 = 4128.23 \text{ kJ/kg} \]
The heat flow rate out is:
\[ \dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = 59.425 \]
