Energy balance:

Equation one: Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between h2 and h3 plus the heat transfer rate minus the work rate.

Equation two: The specific enthalpy hv2 equals the specific enthalpy of R134a at pressure equals temperature equals Ti equals 6 Kelvin and x equals a.

Equation three: The specific enthalpy hv3 equals the specific enthalpy of R134a at pressure equals zero bar.

Equation four: The entropy at state 2 equals the entropy at state 3.
