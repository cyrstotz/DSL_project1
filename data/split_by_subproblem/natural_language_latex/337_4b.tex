The mass flow rate of R134a is denoted as m-dot subscript R134a equals question mark.

The steady state energy rate, E-dot subscript stat, equals zero.

The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the product of m-dot subscript R and the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3, plus Q-dot minus W-dot subscript k.

The work rate, W-dot subscript k, equals the product of the mass flow rate of R134a and the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3.

The enthalpy at state 2, at 8 bar and quality x2 equals 1, is equal to the enthalpy of gas at 8 bar, as per Table A14, and is 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at state 3, at 8 bar and entropy S2, requires interpolation at 8 bar with S2.

The enthalpy at state 3 is calculated using the formula: h3 equals (h at Sx minus h at Sy) divided by (Sx minus Sy) times (S2 minus Sy) plus hy.

The entropy at state 2, at 8 bar and quality x equals 1, as per Table A14, is 0.9066 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and is equal to S3.
