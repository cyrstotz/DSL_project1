1. Left-hand side equation:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry, plus the heat transfer rate minus the reference heat transfer rate.

2. The heat transfer rate from a to b equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at entry and the enthalpy at exit.

3. The enthalpy at entry, denoted as \( h_a \), equals the enthalpy at saturation at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius, which is 2676.1 kilojoules per kilogram.

4. The enthalpy at exit, denoted as \( h_e \), equals the enthalpy at saturation at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius, which is 2626.8 kilojoules per kilogram.

5. The heat transfer rate from a to b is calculated as 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference in enthalpy between 2676.1 kilojoules per kilogram and 2626.8 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in 14.79 kilojoules.
