D equals 10 centimeters, which is 0.1 meters.
R equals 0.05 meters.
A equals 0.007854 square meters, which is equal to R squared times pi.

Given:
p_g,1 equals the sum of p_amb times A, m_K times g, and m_EW times g, all divided by A.
p_g,1 equals p_amb plus A times g times the sum of m_K and m_EW.
p_g,1 equals 100 kilopascals plus 0.007854 square meters times g times the sum of 32 kilograms and 0.1 kilograms.
p_g,1 times A equals p_amb times A plus g times the sum of m_K and m_EW.
p_g,1 equals p_amb plus g divided by A times the sum of m_K and m_EW.
p_g,1 equals 1.4 bar.

Implying:
p_g,1 times V_g,1 equals m_g,1 times R divided by M_g times T_g,1.
With V_g,1 equals 0.0814 cubic meters.
T_g,1 equals 773.15 Kelvin.

m_g,1 equals the product of p_g,1, V_g,1, and M_g divided by the product of R and T_g,1, which equals 3.4212 grams.
