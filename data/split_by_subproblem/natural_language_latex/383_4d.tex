The equation epsilon subscript K equals the absolute value of Q dot subscript e1 divided by the absolute value of W dot subscript t, which equals the absolute value of Q dot subscript ab divided by the absolute value of Q dot subscript ab minus the absolute value of Q dot subscript r2, which equals Q dot subscript ab divided by Q dot subscript ab minus Q dot subscript K plus the absolute value of W dot subscript K.
