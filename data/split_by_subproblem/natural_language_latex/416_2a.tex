a)

A table with two columns. The first column header is T with units in Kelvin (K), and the second column header is eta with units represented as the ratio of dot W over dot q subscript 'in'.

Verbal Description of the Graph:

The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as eta with units as the ratio of dot W over dot q subscript 'in', and the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin. The graph contains a cycle with six points labeled from 1 to 6. The cycle consists of the following segments:

- From point 1 to point 2: A vertical line labeled "isobar".
- From point 2 to point 3: A curved line labeled "isobar" and "p_2".
- From point 3 to point 4: A horizontal line labeled "isobar" and "p equals 0.5 bar".
- From point 4 to point 5: A curved line labeled "isobar" and "p_1".
- From point 5 to point 6: A vertical line labeled "isobar" and "p equals 0.151 bar".
- From point 6 to point 1: A curved line labeled "isobar".
