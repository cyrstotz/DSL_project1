From the lecture:

The generated entropy \( S_{\text{generated}} \) is equal to the absolute value of the heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q} \) divided by the average temperature \( \overline{T} \), multiplied by the difference between the inverse of the hot temperature \( T_{\text{hot}} \) and the inverse of the cold temperature \( T_{\text{cold}} \). This is mathematically represented as:

\[
S_{\text{generated}} = \left| \frac{\dot{Q}}{\overline{T}} \left( \frac{1}{T_{\text{hot}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{cold}}} \right) \right| = 37.8 \frac{\text{kJ}}{293.12 \text{K}} \left( \frac{1}{293.12} - \frac{1}{293.15} \right)
\]

This calculation results in:

\[
= 0.062 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}
\]
