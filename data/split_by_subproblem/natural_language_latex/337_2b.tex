In the given section:

- The values of \( w_{c6} \) and \( T_6 \) are unknown.
- A table is presented with columns labeled P (Pressure), T (Temperature), and V (Volume), and rows numbered from 1 to 6. Specific values and conditions are given for each row:
  - Row 1: Pressure is 0.191, Temperature is -30 degrees Celsius, and Volume is unspecified. It is noted that \( S_4 = S_2 \).
  - Row 2: Pressure \( P_2 = P_3 \) is noted, other details are unspecified.
  - Row 3: Details are unspecified.
  - Row 4: Pressure is 0.5, other details are unspecified. It is noted that \( P_4 = P_5 \).
  - Row 5: Pressure is 0.5, Temperature is 431.9, and \( w_5 = 200 \frac{m}{s} \). It is noted that \( S_5 = S_6 \).
  - Row 6: Pressure is 0.191, other details are unspecified.

- The mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{ges} \) is split into \( \dot{m}_w \) and \( \dot{m}_k \).
- The equation \( \dot{m}_{ges} \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right) + \dot{Q} - \dot{W} = 0 \) is given.
- It is stated that the process is adiabatic, implying \( \dot{Q} = 0 \), and isentropic, implying \( S_6 = S_5 \).
- The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the formula \( T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{P_6}{P_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} = 328.075 \, \text{K} \) where \( n = 1.4 \).
- The equation \( c_p (T_5 - T_6) + \frac{w_5^2}{2} = \frac{w_6^2}{2} = 128647.95 \) is provided.
- Finally, it is concluded that \( w_{c6} = 507.29 \, \frac{m}{s} \).
