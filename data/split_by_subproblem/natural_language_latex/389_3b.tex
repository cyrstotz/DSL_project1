Item b) The pressure \( p_{a,2} \) equals \( p_{a,1} \) which is 140.1 kPa (The mass of the evaporator, piston, and mold does not change).

Thermodynamic equilibrium: \( T_{a,2} \) equals \( T_{EW,2} \)

The pressure \( p_{EW,2} \) is calculated as \( p_0 \) plus \( \frac{m k g}{A} \), which equals 139.97 kPa, approximately 1.3997 bar.

Interpolating with Table 1:

The ratio \( \frac{0.0024}{0.003} \) equals \( \frac{T_{EW,2} - 0.003}{-0.4} \), approximately 0.897 bar.

Thus, \( T_{a,2} \) equals 0 degrees Celsius.
