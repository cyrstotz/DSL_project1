The total entropy change, denoted as S dot subscript ges, is equal to the sum of the heat flow rate, Q dot subscript aus, divided by the temperature, T. This is expressed as the heat flow rate divided by the reactor temperature, T subscript Reaktor, plus the heat flow rate divided by the cooling fluid temperature, T subscript KF.

The total entropy change, S dot subscript ges, equals 0.06049 per second per Kelvin.
