The variables and equations are as follows:

- \( w_c, T_f \)
- The temperature \( T_s \) is 431.9 Kelvin.
- The pressure \( P_s \) is 0.5 bar.
- The speed \( w_s \) is 220 meters per second.
- The pressure \( P_6 \) is 0.197 bar.
- The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q} \) is equal to the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the expression \( h_s - h_c + \frac{w_s^2 - w_6^2}{2} \).
- The difference in enthalpy \( h_s - h_c \) is the negative integral from \( T_c \) to \( T_s \) of \( c_p dT \), which equals -1.606 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
- The temperature \( T_c \) is calculated as \( T_s \) times the power of \( \frac{P_6}{P_s} \) raised to \( \frac{n-1}{n} \), resulting in 328.07 Kelvin.
- The specific volume \( v \) is given by \( \frac{RT}{P} \).
- The integral from 5 to 6 of \( v dp \) equals \( R \) times \( T_6 - T_s \).
- The gas constant \( R \) is \( c_p - c_v \) and equals 1.725 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
- The work \( W_v \) is \( R \) times \( T_6 - T_s \), calculated as \( \frac{1.725 \times (328.07 - 431.9)}{1 - 1.4} \), resulting in -6.477 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The change in enthalpy \( \Delta h \) is \( \Delta v \) times \( \frac{1}{k} \).
- The square of the speed \( w_6 \) is \( w_s^2 + 2 \Delta h \).
- The speed \( w_6 \) is the square root of \( 447.77 + 2 \times w_s^2 \), resulting in 312.50 meters per second.
