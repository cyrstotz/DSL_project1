The freezing point temperature, T_KF, is 70 degrees Celsius, and the temperature at pin 12, T_pin,12, is 200 degrees Celsius. There is a mass change, Delta m_12, between state 1 and state 2, where Delta m_12 is greater than zero.

The equation m_2 times u_2 minus m_1 times u_1 minus Delta m_12 times h_e equals Q.

Another equation is (m_1 plus m_2) times u_2 minus m_1 times u_1 minus Delta m_12 times h_e equals Q.

For part d, the equations are as follows:
m_1 times u_2 plus m_e times (u_2 minus h_e) minus m_1 times u_1 equals Q.

m_e equals the quotient of Q plus m_1 times (h_1 minus u_2) divided by (u_2 minus h_e).

Q equals negative 35 Mega Joules.

m_1 equals 5.755 kilograms.

The temperatures are given as T_1 equals 100 degrees Celsius, T_2 equals 70 degrees Celsius, and T_e equals 200 degrees Celsius.

The internal energies at different temperatures and a factor of 5. F are represented as u_1 at 100 degrees Celsius, u_2 at 70 degrees Celsius, and u_e at 200 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy at 200 degrees Celsius and 5. F is represented as h_e.

The values 4.13 times 10 to the power of 2, and 4.29, 38 kiloJoules per kilogram plus 4.18, 94 plus 0.005 times 205.045 are also provided.
