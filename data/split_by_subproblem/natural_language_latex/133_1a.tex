a) Gauss: First equation
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the rate of heat flow out, plus the heat transfer rate.

Table A-2:
The enthalpy at the inlet at 700 degrees Celsius in gaseous form is 292.984 kilojoules per kilogram.
The enthalpy at the outlet at 1000 degrees Celsius in gaseous form is 419.044 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat flow out is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet, plus the rate of heat flow out, plus the heat transfer rate.
This equals 62.182 kilowatts.
