The question asks for the value of S-dot with subscript EZ, which is represented as "S-dot subscript EZ equals question mark".

The solution starts with the equation:
Sum over i of (Q-dot subscript i divided by T subscript i) plus S-dot subscript EZ equals zero. This implies that S-dot subscript EZ equals negative of (Q-dot subscript ums divided by T subscript KEF), which further simplifies to negative of (negative 62.3 kW divided by 275 K).

Finally, it is concluded that:
S-dot subscript EZ equals 0.2 kW per K.
