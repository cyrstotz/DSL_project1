- The graph is a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram.
- The x-axis is labeled T in degrees Celsius and the y-axis is labeled p in bar.
- The graph shows a dome-shaped curve with three distinct regions:
  - The left side of the curve is labeled "liquid."
  - The right side of the curve is labeled "vapor."
  - The area under the curve is labeled "wet steam."
- There are three points marked on the graph:
  - Point 1 is at the peak of the dome.
  - Point 2 is on the left side of the dome.
  - Point 3 is on the right side of the dome.
- The temperature at the left intersection of the dome with the x-axis is labeled T1.
- The temperature at the right intersection of the dome with the x-axis is labeled T2.
- The pressure at the right end of the graph is labeled pD.
