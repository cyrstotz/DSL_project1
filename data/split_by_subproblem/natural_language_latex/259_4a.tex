The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as p[bar] and the x-axis labeled as T[degrees Celsius]. There are two lines labeled (i) and (ii). Line (i) starts from the origin and goes upwards with a positive slope. Line (ii) starts from the same point as line (i) but has a steeper slope. The region between the two lines is labeled as "test". The area below line (i) is labeled as "liquid" and the area above line (ii) is labeled as "gas".

The equation is e_k equals the ratio of Q_hat_2a to the difference of Q_hat_0b minus Q_hat_2a.
