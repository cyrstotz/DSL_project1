Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance, plus the heat transfer rate divided by the irreversible temperature, plus the generated entropy.

The generated entropy equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit, minus the heat transfer rate divided by the irreversible temperature, which is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the entrance and the entropy at the exit, plus the heat transfer rate divided by the irreversible temperature.

Values:
The entropy at the exit, denoted as S_e, at 70 degrees Celsius is 0.3564 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
The entropy at the entrance, denoted as S_a, at 100 degrees Celsius is 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Therefore, the generated entropy, denoted as S_erz, is 0.3178 kilojoules per Kelvin.
