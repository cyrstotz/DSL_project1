Entropy balance around the reactor wall:

In matrix form:
- The first matrix has two rows, the first row is the heat flow out of the system, denoted as Q dot with subscript "aus" (out),
- The second row is the average temperature of the coolant fluid, denoted as T bar with subscript "KF".

The second matrix has a single row, which is the heat flow out of the system, denoted as Q dot with subscript "aus".

The third matrix has a single row, which is the average temperature of the reactor, denoted as T bar with subscript "Reaktor".

The equation zero equals m dot times (s subscript "ein" minus s subscript "aus") plus Q dot over T bar plus S dot with subscript "ez".

The equation Q dot with subscript "aus" minus Q dot with subscript "aus" over T bar with subscript "KF" plus S dot with subscript "ez" equals zero.

The equation for S dot with subscript "ez" equals Q dot with subscript "aus" times (1 over T bar with subscript "KF" minus 1 over T bar with subscript "Reaktor").

S dot with subscript "ez" equals 0.0455 kilojoules per milligram Kelvin.

Which equals 45.5 joules per milligram Kelvin.

The average temperature of the coolant fluid, T bar with subscript "KF", equals 293.12 Kelvin.
