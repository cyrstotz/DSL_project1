The mass flow rate from point 1 to point 3 to point 4 is zero, denoted as the first F.P.

The time derivative of mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between point 2 and point 3 plus the canceled heat transfer from point 2 to point 3, which is zero due to being adiabatic, minus the canceled work done, which is also zero.

The ratio of the work done to the difference in enthalpy between point 2 and point 3 equals the mass flow rate.

The entropy at point 2 equals the entropy at point 3, and the pressure at point 3 equals the pressure at point 4.

The enthalpy at point 2 is equal to the fluid enthalpy plus the quality at point 2 times the difference between the gas enthalpy and the fluid enthalpy.

The enthalpy at point 2 equals the fluid enthalpy, since the quality at point 2 minus one equals zero.

The enthalpy at point 3 is the enthalpy at 8 bar.
