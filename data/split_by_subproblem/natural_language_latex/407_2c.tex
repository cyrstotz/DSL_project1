Continuing, the initial specific volume \( v_0 \) equals the ratio of \( v_0 \) over \( \rho_0 \), which is 3.65 cubic meters per kilogram.

The average of \( v_0 \) and \( v_2 \) is 21.78 kilojoules per kilogram.

The change in specific internal energy \( \Delta e_{x1str} \) is 159.158 kilojoules per kilogram.

Continuing from there, the work \( W_r \) is calculated but not provided.

From the subsection "Task 2c continued from above":

The difference \( h_0 - h_0 \) equals \( c_p \) times the temperature difference \( T_0 - T_0 \), which results in 85.96 kilojoules per kilogram.

The change in specific internal energy \( \Delta e_{x1str} \) is 145.17 kilojoules per kilogram.
