The rate of entropy generation, denoted as S dot subscript 'erz', and the average temperature T bar subscript 'KF' increase the rate of heat output Q dot subscript 'aus'.

The rate of heat output Q dot subscript 'aus' is highlighted in a box.

The term 'Treaker' increases the rate of heat output Q dot subscript 'aus'.

The rate of change of Z dot superscript 'o' with respect to time t equals the sum of the rate of heat Q dot divided by the temperature T subscript i plus the rate of entropy generation S dot subscript 'erz'.

The rate of entropy generation S dot subscript 'erz' equals the rate of heat output Q dot subscript 'aus' divided by the average temperature T bar subscript 'KF' minus the rate of heat output Q dot subscript 'aus' divided by 'Treaker' multiplied by 46.15 watts per kelvin.

In the additional equations:
- The specific internal energy at 70 degrees Celsius u subscript g is 2469.6 kilojoules per kilogram, denoted as T subscript R,2.
- The total mass m subscript 'ges', 1 times u subscript 2 plus the change in mass Delta m subscript x2 times the enthalpy h subscript g minus m subscript 1 times u subscript 1 equals the change in mass Delta m subscript x2 times the enthalpy h subscript g at 20 degrees Celsius minus the rate of heat Q dot subscript R12.
- The change in mass Delta m subscript x2 equals the negative of the expression (the rate of heat Q dot subscript R12 plus the total mass m subscript 'ges', 1 times u subscript 2 minus m subscript 1 times u subscript 1) divided by (u subscript 2 minus the enthalpy h subscript g at 20 degrees Celsius).
