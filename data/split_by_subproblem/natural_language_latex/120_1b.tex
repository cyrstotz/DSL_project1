The average temperature T_KP is unknown, represented as T_KP = ?.

The average temperature T-bar is defined as the integral from e to a of T ds.

For an ideal fluid, T-bar is equal to q_12 divided by the difference s_a minus s_e.

The integral from e to a of T ds equals q_12 in a reversible process, denoted as rev.

T-bar is also expressed as q_12 divided by the difference s_a minus s_e, which is further simplified to q_12 divided by e times the natural logarithm of T_1 over T_1.

Finally, T-bar is calculated as negative 63.652 divided by the natural logarithm of 298.15 over 298.15.
