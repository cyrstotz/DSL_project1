a) Tau of T

Graph Description:
The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled Tau of T and the horizontal axis labeled s in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph consists of a piecewise linear and curved plot with the following points and segments:
- Point 1 at the origin (0,0).
- A line segment from point 1 to point 2, which is slightly above and to the right of point 1.
- A line segment from point 2 to point 3, which is further above and to the right of point 2.
- A curved segment from point 3 to point 4, which is above and to the right of point 3.
- A line segment from point 4 to point 5, which is below and to the right of point 4.
- A line segment from point 5 to point 6, which is below and to the left of point 5.
- A line segment from point 6 back to point 2, closing the loop.
