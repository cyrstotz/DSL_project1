- A diagram with the y-axis labeled as \( p(\text{Pa}) \) and the x-axis labeled as \( T(\text{K}) \).
- There are three phase regions separated by lines:
  - A region on the top left labeled as "solid".
  - A region on the top right labeled as "liquid".
  - A region at the bottom labeled as "gas".
- A green vertical line that runs from the x-axis upwards and is marked with "i".
- A green horizontal line that runs from the y-axis to the right and is marked with "ii".
- A blue curve that runs from the bottom left to the top right separating the phase regions.

The equation is:
\[ \epsilon_u = \frac{\dot{Q}_{zu}}{(W+1)} = \frac{\dot{Q}_k}{28W} \]
