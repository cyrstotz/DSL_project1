The fraction Q over T equals the integral from s1 to s2 of T dS, which equals the fraction of h2 minus h1 plus V times p2 minus p1, all over T, which equals C times the fraction of T2 minus T1 over T. This is equal to C times the natural logarithm of the fraction T2 over T1. This is further equal to c times the natural logarithm of the fraction T2 over T1.
