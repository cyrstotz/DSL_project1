The subsection is titled "Thermo. Average temp." The equations are as follows:

The average temperature, denoted as T tilde, is equal to the integral from S_a to S_e of T dS, divided by S_a minus S_e.

This is equal to c_w times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_a to T_e, divided by c_w times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_a to T_e.

This is further equal to h_a minus h_e divided by S_a minus S_e, which is equal to c_w times (T_a minus T_e) plus v times (p_2 divided by p_1), all divided by c_w times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_a to T_e.

Finally, this is equal to 10 divided by the natural logarithm of the ratio of 292.15 to 288.15, which approximately equals 293.121 Kelvin.
