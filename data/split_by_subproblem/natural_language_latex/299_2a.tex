The graph is described as a Temperature (T) versus Entropy (s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as 's' and the y-axis is labeled as 'T'. The graph includes several points and lines:

- Point 0 is located at the origin.
- Point 1 is positioned slightly above point 0.
- Point 2 is to the right of point 1 and is connected to it by a line labeled "isotrop".
- Point 3 is above point 2 and is connected to it by a vertical line labeled "isobar".
- Point 4 is to the right of point 3 and is connected to it by a line labeled "P2 equals P3".
- Point 5 is below point 4 and is connected to it by a line labeled "isobar".
- A dashed line connects point 0 to point 5, and it is labeled "p0 equals 0.191 bar".
- The temperature at point 5, which is 437.9 Kelvin, is marked on the y-axis.
- The temperature at point 0, which is greater than 30, is also marked on the y-axis.
