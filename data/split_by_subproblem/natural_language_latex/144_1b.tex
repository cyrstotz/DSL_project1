The equation for \( T_k \) is given by the ratio of the integral of \( T \) with respect to \( s \) from \( s_a \) to \( s_e \) over the difference \( s_a - s_e \), which simplifies to \( \frac{h_a - h_e}{s_a - s_e} \).

For an ideal fluid, the difference \( h_a - h_e \) is expressed as \( c_p (T_A - T_E) + v_f (p_E - p_A) \).

The difference \( s_a - s_e \) is given by \( c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_A}{T_E} \right) \).

This leads to the ratio \( \frac{T_k}{T_E} \) being equal to \( \frac{c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_A}{T_E} \right)}{c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_A}{T_E} \right)} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{T_A - T_E}{\ln \left( \frac{T_A}{T_E} \right)} \).

Therefore, \( T_k \) is calculated as \( \frac{T_A - T_E}{\ln \left( \frac{T_A}{T_E} \right)} \) which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
