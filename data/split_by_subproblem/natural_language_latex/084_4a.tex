The graph description is as follows: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as 'p' and the horizontal axis labeled as 'T'. The graph starts at the origin and rises to a peak labeled as 'T_max' (i). After reaching the peak, the graph descends and then rises again to a point labeled as (ii). The region under the initial rise is labeled as "Nassdampf" which translates to "Wet steam". The graph then continues to the right, labeled as 'g.c.s'.
