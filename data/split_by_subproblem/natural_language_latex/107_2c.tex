The rate of change of exergy with respect to the stream, denoted as E dot subscript x comma str, equals the mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, times the specific exergy of the stream, denoted as e subscript x comma str. This is equal to the mass flow rate, m dot, times the expression in parentheses: h minus h zero minus T zero times (s minus s zero) plus v squared over 2 plus g times z.
