The values given are:
- Exit velocity \( W_e \) equals 5.10 meters per second, and initial temperature \( T_0 \) equals 340 Kelvin.

The exergy balance around the turbine, assuming steady state and a single mass flow, and considering all processes in dry running conditions, is described by:
- The change in specific exergy due to the stream \( \Delta e_{\text{ex,str}} \) equals negative of the expression \([ h_0 - h_e - T_0 (s_0 - s_e) + \text{all } \frac{w^2}{2} ]\),
- where "all" is defined as \(\frac{w_0^2 - w_e^2}{2}\).

Further calculations show:
- The difference in specific enthalpy \( h_0 - h_e \) equals the specific heat at constant pressure \( c_p \) times the difference in temperatures \( T_0 - T_e \), which equals -97.4311 kilojoules per kilogram,
- The difference in specific entropy \( s_0 - s_e \) equals the specific heat at constant pressure \( c_p \) times the natural logarithm of the ratio \( \frac{T_0}{T_e} \), which equals -0.57927 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin,
- The expression \(\frac{w_0^2 - w_e^2}{2}\) equals -1.00050 kilojoules per kilogram.

Finally, the change in specific exergy due to the stream \( \Delta e_{\text{ex,str}} \) is calculated as:
- \(-[ 207.878 \frac{kJ}{kg} ]\),
- which results in \( \Delta e_{\text{ex,str}} \) equals 115.797 kilojoules per kilogram.
