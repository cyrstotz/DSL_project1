Monobrom is heat transferring, thus the EW has the same temperature. The same applies to the pressure, since Monobrom is isothermal.

The equation is rho_2 equals F_K divided by r_2, which equals 32 kilograms times 9.8065 meters per second squared, divided by 0.005 meters times pi, equals approximately 3955.9987 Newtons per square meter, which is approximately 3956 Newtons per square meter.
