In a closed system:

The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to the sum of heat added, Sigma Q, minus the sum of work done, Sigma W.

The change in internal energy, Delta U, is equal to the sum of heat added, Sigma Q.

For mass m2, the difference in internal energy per unit mass from state 1 to state 2, multiplied by m2, equals the heat added, Q.

The pressure at state 2, p subscript g,2, is equal to the pressure at state 1, p subscript g,1, which is 1.399 bar.

Note: (at pressure p equals 1.4 bar (Table 1))

The internal energy at state 1, U1, is equal to the internal energy in the liquid phase plus x1 times the difference between the internal energy in the solid phase and the liquid phase.

The value of U1 is -200.0938.

The internal energy at state 2, U2, is equal to the internal energy in the liquid phase plus x2 times the difference between the internal energy in the solid phase and the liquid phase.

The internal energy in the liquid phase, U subscript liquid, is -333.458.

The internal energy in the solid phase, U subscript solid, is -0.045.
