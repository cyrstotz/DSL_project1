A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as s and the y-axis labeled as T. There are three curves labeled as P0, P1, and P2 from bottom to top. The curve P0 is labeled as P0 equals P6 equals 0.1594 bar. The curve P1 is labeled as 0.5 bar equals P5. The curve P2 is not labeled with a specific value. There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The points are connected with lines as follows:

- The line from point 0 to point 1 is a vertical line labeled as "isentropic".
- The line from point 1 to point 2 is a horizontal line labeled as "isobaric".
- The line from point 2 to point 3 is a vertical line labeled as "isentropic".
- The line from point 3 to point 4 is a horizontal line labeled as "isobaric".
- The line from point 4 to point 5 is a vertical line labeled as "isentropic".
- The line from point 5 to point 6 is a vertical line labeled as "isentropic".

The inequalities and equalities are as follows:
- P1 is greater than P0.
- P2 equals P3.
- P6 equals P0.
- Pr equals 0.5 bar.
