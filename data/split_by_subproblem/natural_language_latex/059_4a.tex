The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as p and the horizontal axis labeled as T. The graph contains three curves. The first curve starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak in the middle, and then falls back down to the bottom right. The second and third curves are horizontal lines that intersect the first curve at different points. The second curve is above the third curve.
