Calculate with the absolute value of \( Q_{12} \) equals 1500 Joules.

The change in energy \( \Delta E \) equals the mass of the evaporating water \( m_{ew} \) times the difference between \( u_2 \) and \( u_1 \), which equals \( Q_{12} \) plus \( \dot{W} \).

\( u_2 \) equals \( u_1 \) plus the fraction of \( Q_{12} \) over \( m_{ew} \), which implies \( u_2 \) equals \( u_{fe} \) at 0 degrees Celsius plus the fraction of \( Q_{12} \) over \( m_{ew} \) times the difference between \( \mu_{H} \) at 0 degrees Celsius and \( c_{H} \) at 0 degrees Celsius, equals plus 4n minus 200.0928.

Interpolation results in 0.603 degrees Celsius.

\( x_{e2} \) equals the fraction of the difference between \( T_{amb} \) and \( T_{amb} \) over the difference between \( u_{H} \) and \( u_{fe} \), equals 0.555.
