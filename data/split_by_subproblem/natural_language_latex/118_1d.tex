Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry, plus the rate of heat transfer R, plus the rate of heat transfer out. The mass flow rate equals negative the sum of the rate of heat transfer R and the rate of heat transfer out, divided by the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry.
