Entropy change due to heat flow (mass of heat equals zero):

Negative the rate of heat input divided by the high temperature plus the rate of heat output divided by the low temperature plus the rate of entropy change equals zero.

The rate of heat input divided by the high temperature minus the rate of heat output divided by the low temperature equals the rate of entropy change.

The low temperature, T_W, equals 100 degrees Celsius which is 373.15 Kelvin.

The rate of entropy change, S_ent, equals 0.095 micro-Siemens per Kelvin, which is 95.5 Joules per Kelvin.
