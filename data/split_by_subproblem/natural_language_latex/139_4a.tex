The graph description includes a plot with the y-axis labeled as P and the x-axis labeled as T. There are four regions marked on the graph:
- The top left region is labeled as "solid".
- The top right region is labeled as "liquid".
- The bottom right region is labeled as "gaseous".

There are two curves on the graph:
- The first curve starts from the "solid" region and curves upwards towards the "liquid" region.
- The second curve starts from the "liquid" region and curves downwards towards the "gaseous" region.

There are also several arrows and annotations indicating transitions between the states.
