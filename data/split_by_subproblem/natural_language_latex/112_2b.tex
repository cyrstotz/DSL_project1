Balance of the thrust nozzle: zero equals the total mass flow rate times the quantity h5 minus h6 plus one half times the difference of w5 squared and w6 squared, plus the heat transfer rate plus the work rate.

One half times the difference of w5 squared and w6 squared equals the cancelled work rate minus the heat transfer rate minus the total mass flow rate times the quantity h5 minus h6.

The total mass flow rate equals the difference of h5 and h6 divided by the specific heat capacity at constant pressure times the difference of T6 and T5.

Implies that wE squared equals two times the quantity h5 minus h6 minus w5 squared divided by five.

T6 equals T5 times the ratio of p6 over p5 raised to the power of kappa minus one over kappa, equals 433.19 Kelvin.

0.49 bar times the reciprocal of 4.9.
