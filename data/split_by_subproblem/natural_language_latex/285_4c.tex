c) The first equation is:
x subscript 1 equals the fraction with numerator h minus h subscript f and denominator h subscript fg, which equals the fraction with numerator 239.85 minus 42.25 and denominator 232.85 minus 492.5, resulting in 1.0091.

The second equation is:
h subscript 1 at T equals negative 22 degrees Celsius equals the fraction with numerator 237.35 minus 236.5 and denominator negative 26.43 plus 20, multiplied by negative 2, plus 236.5, resulting in 234.93. This calculation involves interpolation.
