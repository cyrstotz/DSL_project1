The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The y-axis is labeled P with units in bar. The x-axis is labeled T with units in degrees Celsius. The graph shows a curve that starts at point 1 on the x-axis, rises to a peak, and then descends to point 2 on the x-axis. There is an arrow pointing from point 2 to point 1 along the x-axis.
