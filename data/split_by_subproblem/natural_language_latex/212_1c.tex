The rate of entropy production, denoted as S dot subscript rez, equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference between the entropy at exit, s subscript e, and the entropy at entry, s subscript e, minus the heat transfer rate, Q double dot subscript aus, divided by the temperature T subscript j, which equals the heat transfer rate, Q dot, divided by the temperature T subscript k.

The change in energy, Delta E, equals the change in internal energy, Delta U, which is equal to the heat added, Q, minus the work done, W. Therefore, Delta Q equals Delta U plus W, which equals negative 1229.183 Joules.

The change in internal energy, Delta U, equals the mass, m, times the specific heat at constant volume, c subscript V, times the difference in temperature from T subscript 2 to T subscript 1, which equals negative 1139.393 Joules.

The work done, W, equals the gas constant, R, times the difference in temperature from T subscript 2 to T subscript 1, divided by 1.4 minus 1, times the mass, m, which equals negative 89.789 Joules.
