Graph description:
The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The y-axis is labeled T in Kelvin and the x-axis is labeled s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. There are six points labeled 1 to 6. The points are connected by lines forming a closed loop. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, point 4 is below point 3, point 5 is to the left of point 4, and point 6 is to the left of point 5. There are three dashed lines labeled p equals p0, p equals p2, and p equals p3 from bottom to top. There is a bypass arrow pointing from point 4 to point 6.
