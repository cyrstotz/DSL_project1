The average temperature, denoted as T-bar, is given by the formula:
T-bar equals the integral from T_e to T_a of T dS, all divided by s_a minus s_e.

The integral from T_e to T_a of T dS equals the integral from T_e to T_a of dH minus V dp, where the pressure p is constant.

This simplifies to (h_a minus h_e) divided by (s_a minus s_e).

s_a minus s_e equals the integral from T_e to T_a of c_if over T dT, which simplifies to c_if times the natural logarithm of (T_a divided by T_e).

h_a minus h_e equals the integral from T_e to T_a of c_if dT, which simplifies to c_if times (T_a minus T_e).

Substituting these into the formula for T-bar, we get T-bar equals (T_a minus T_e) divided by the natural logarithm of (T_a divided by T_e), which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
