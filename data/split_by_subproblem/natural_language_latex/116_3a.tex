p0 plus p1 equals mg.

For critical equilibrium:

The area of the cylinder, A_Zyl, equals 0.05 squared times pi, which equals pi divided by 100, which equals 7.85 times 10 to the power of negative 3.

Figure Description: A horizontal cylinder is shown with an upward arrow labeled p1 times 0.05 squared times pi and a downward arrow labeled 1 bar. Another downward arrow is labeled 32.1 times 9.81.

p1 equals (32.1 times 9.81) divided by (0.05 squared times pi) plus 1 bar equals 400394.4 Pascals plus 1 bar equals 0.400394 bar plus 1 bar.

Equals 1.400394 bar.

Ideal Gas Law:

M equals (pV) divided by (RT) equals (1.400394 times 10 to the power of 5 times 3.14) divided by (8.314 times (500 plus 273.15)) equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms.

Equals 0.00314 kilograms.
