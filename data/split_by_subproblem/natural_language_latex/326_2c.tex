The velocity w_6 is 540 meters per second and the temperature T_6 is 380 Kelvin.

The specific exergy destruction e_{x, str} is equal to the rate of exergy destruction per mass flow rate, which is h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus half of the square of (540 minus 200 meters per second).

The rate of exergy destruction per mass flow rate is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure times (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 times (the specific heat at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_6 to T_1 minus the gas constant times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 1 to 1).

The average temperature T_0 is minus 30 degrees Celsius, which equals 273.15 minus 30 Kelvin, resulting in 243.15 Kelvin.

This results in 4.15 kilojoules per kilogram.
