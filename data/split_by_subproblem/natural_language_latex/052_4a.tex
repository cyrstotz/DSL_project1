- Graph I:
  - The graph is a PV diagram with the y-axis labeled as pressure in bars and the x-axis labeled as volume.
  - There is a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  - The path goes from point 1 to point 2, then from point 2 to point 3, from point 3 to point 4, and from point 4 back to point 1.
  - The path from point 1 to point 2 is horizontal, from point 2 to point 3 is vertical, from point 3 to point 4 is horizontal, and from point 4 to point 1 is vertical.

- Graph II:
  - The graph is a PT diagram with the y-axis labeled as pressure in bars and the x-axis labeled as temperature in Kelvin.
  - There are two curves, one labeled as 'liquid' and the other as 'vapor'.
  - There are two points labeled 1 and 2 on the liquid curve.
  - There is an arrow pointing from point 1 to point 2.
