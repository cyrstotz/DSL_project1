The pressure is the same as in state 1, since the forces acting on the piston have not changed. The pressure \( p_{g2} \) equals \( p_{g3} \) equals 1.4 bar.

The temperature has changed since energy was absorbed to melt the ice water.

The specific heat at constant volume \( C_v \) is 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

The specific heat at constant pressure \( C_p \) is the gas constant \( R \) plus \( C_v \), which equals 166.28 Joules per kilogram per Kelvin plus 633 Joules per kilogram per Kelvin, resulting in 799.28 Joules per kilogram per Kelvin.
