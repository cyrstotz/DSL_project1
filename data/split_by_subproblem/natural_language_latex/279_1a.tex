The mass flow rate, denoted as m-dot, is 0.3 kilograms per second.

The heat output rate, denoted as Q-dot-out, is calculated as the product of the mass flow rate and the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet, h-out, and the enthalpy at the inlet, h-in, minus Q-dot-a.

From Table A2:
The enthalpy at the inlet, h-in, at 70 degrees Celsius is 292.88 kilojoules per kilogram.
The enthalpy at the outlet, h-out, at 100 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The calculated heat output rate, Q-dot-out, is negative 62.187 kilowatts.

The change in entropy from state 1 to state 2, denoted as Delta s_12, is the difference between the entropy at state 2, s_2, and the entropy at state 1, s_1.

From Table A-2:
The entropy at 100 degrees Celsius for the liquid phase, s(100 degrees Celsius)_f, is 1.306 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
The entropy at 100 degrees Celsius for the vapor phase, s(100 degrees Celsius)_g, is 7.358 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
The entropy at 90 degrees Celsius for the liquid phase, s(90 degrees Celsius)_f, is 0.955 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy at state 1, s_1, is calculated as s_f plus x_0 times the difference between s_g and s_f, resulting in 1.337 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
The entropy at state 2, s_2, is 0.955 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The change in entropy from state 1 to state 2, Delta s_12, is negative 0.382 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
