System around the gas:

The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times the heat flow rate plus the power, which implies that the change in internal energy is equal to the heat added minus the work done.

The work done is equal to the pressure times the integral of the volume from initial volume to final volume, which simplifies to pressure times the difference between final and initial volumes. Substituting the values, the work done equals 1.401 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals times (1.105 times 10 to the power of negative 3 minus 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3) cubic meters, resulting in negative 284.483 Joules.

The final volume is calculated as the mass of the gas times the gas constant times the final temperature divided by the molar mass of the gas times the final pressure. Substituting the values, the final volume equals 3.42 kilograms times the gas constant times 273.15 Kelvin divided by (50 kilograms per mole times 1.401 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals), resulting in 1.105 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.

The change in enthalpy is equal to the mass times the specific heat at constant volume times the change in temperature, which equals the heat added plus 284.483 Joules.

The heat added is calculated as the mass times the specific heat capacity times the difference in temperatures minus 284.483 Joules, approximately equaling 1082 Joules.
