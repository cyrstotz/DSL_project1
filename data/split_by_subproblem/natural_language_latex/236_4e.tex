State Table:

The table consists of four columns labeled 'State', 'P', 'T', and 'x'. It has four rows detailing the states:

1. State 1: P equals p1 which is equal to p2, with a value of 1.5748 bar. T and x are not specified.
2. State 2: P equals p2 which is equal to p1, with a value of 1.5748 bar, and T is 257.15 Kelvin, x is 1. The state is described as saturated vapor.
3. State 3: P is 8 bar. T and x are not specified.
4. State 4: P is 8 bar and x is 0. T is not specified.

Additional information:
- The work W_k is 25 Watts and the process is adiabatic.

Equations:
- The temperature in the evaporator T is given by T_i minus 6 Kelvin, which calculates to 263.15 Kelvin minus 6 Kelvin, resulting in an underlined value of 257.15 Kelvin.
- T_i, read from Figure 5, is the sublimation point at minus 20 degrees Celsius, which equals 253.15 Kelvin.
- T_i is then calculated as 253.15 Kelvin plus 10 Kelvin, resulting in an underlined value of 263.15 Kelvin.
