Stationary process

Implying zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference in enthalpy in minus enthalpy out, plus the heat transfer rate R, minus the heat transfer rate out divided by temperature T.

The mass flow rate in equals the mass flow rate out.

The heat transfer rate out equals the mass flow rate in times the difference in enthalpy in minus enthalpy out, plus the heat transfer rate R.
