c) The pressure \( p_{g2} \) equals \( p_1 \), implying that the density and mass have not changed.

Energy balance of EW and gas:

The change in internal energy \( U_2 - U_1 \) equals the heat transfer \( Q_{12} \).

The equation \(-m_g \times U_2 - m_g \times U_1 = Q_{12}\) leads to \( Q_{12} = 80.0036 \, kg \times \left( u(0.0034 \, \frac{m^3}{kg}) \right) - u(500^\circ C, 1.15 \, bar)\).
