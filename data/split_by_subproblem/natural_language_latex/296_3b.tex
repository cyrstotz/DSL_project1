The equations are as follows:

1. \( P_{g,2} \) equals \( P_{g,1} \), because
2. \( P_{g,2} \) equals the fraction of \( F_g \) over \( A \) plus 'Passen'.
3. \( T_{m,2} \) equals \( E_{W,1} \), because a thermodynamic equilibrium is established.
4. \( \text{d}t_{EIS} \) equals \( \text{d}t_{L} \) and 'Passen', not everything has melted to ice.
