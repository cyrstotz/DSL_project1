In state 1, we have obtained a pressure:

Point, the force F_S divided by area A equals p_1, which implies p_1 equals (m_x plus m_w) times g divided by (D divided by 2 squared times pi), which equals 140089.4 Pascals.

With pV equals nRT,

T equals 500 plus 273.15, which equals 773.15 Kelvin.

This implies n equals pV divided by RT, approximately 0.068.

With M_g equals 50 milligrams per millimeter,

we obtain m_g equals M_g divided by 1000 times n, approximately 3.42 grams.
