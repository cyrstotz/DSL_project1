b)

The average temperature T-bar is given by the formula:
T-bar equals the integral from s_e to s_a of T ds, divided by s_a minus s_e.

s_a minus s_e equals c_if times the natural logarithm of T_2 over T_1.

The integral from s_e to s_a of T ds equals the number sign times (s_a minus s_e).

The average temperature T-bar equals the sum of T_1 and T_2 divided by 2, which equals 233.75 degrees Celsius, because if with constant c_if.
