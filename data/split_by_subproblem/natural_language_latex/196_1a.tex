Coolant equals ideal fluid.

The equation zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference of enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance plus the heat flow rate minus the work done by the turbine, leading to constant pressure.

The heat flow rate out is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the entrance and the enthalpy at the exit.

The difference between the enthalpy at the entrance and the enthalpy at the exit equals the specific heat capacity at constant pressure of the gas times the difference in temperature from the entrance to the exit.

Energy balance reactor:

Boiling implies the wet steam region.

The equation zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference of enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance plus the heat flow rate minus the work done by the turbine equals zero.

The heat flow rate equals 100 kilowatts minus the heat flow rate out.

The heat flow rate out equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance plus 100 kilowatts.

The enthalpy at the exit equals unknown.

Table A-1:

The enthalpy of fluid equals 237.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy of gas equals 2626.8 kilojoules per kilogram.

The specific volume at the exit equals unknown.
