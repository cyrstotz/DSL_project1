T02 equals Tewz because equilibrium is in state 2.
Water in state 1: 0 degrees Celsius at x equals 0 in the two-phase region.
According to Table 1 at 0 degrees Celsius, pew equals 1.4 bar.
State 2: pewz equals pew (still in the two-phase region), therefore
T02 equals Tewz equals 0 degrees Celsius.

p01 equals p02 equals 1.401 bar, this is valid since the membrane and piston are frictionless,
and the mass that rests on the gas is unchangeable.
