The change in internal energy Delta U equals Q_12, which implies that the mass flow rate from state 1 to 2 of water times the difference in specific internal energy between state 1 of water and state 1 equals Q_12.

The specific internal energy at state 12 equals the heat transfer Q_12 divided by the mass flow rate from state 1 to 2 of water plus the specific internal energy at state 1, which equals negative 122.58 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 1.

The specific internal energy at state 12 for a quality of 0.6 equals the specific internal energy at state 1 for the fluid plus the quality times the difference between the specific internal energy at state 1 for the gas and the specific internal energy at state 1 for the fluid.

This equals 333.458 plus 0.6 times the sum of negative 0.045 plus the ratio of 673.339 to 333.458.

This results in negative 133.4162 kilojoules per kilogram.

This implies that the evaporation temperature T_evr equals 0.05.

The quality x equals 0.005.

The quality at state 2 equals the difference between the specific internal energy at state 2 and the specific internal energy at state 2 for the fluid, divided by the difference between the specific internal energy at state 2 for the fluid and the specific internal energy at state 2 for the fluid, which equals 0.632.
