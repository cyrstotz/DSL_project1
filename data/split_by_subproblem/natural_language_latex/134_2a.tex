The content includes two tables and a description of a graph:

1. The first table has one column with the header "T [degrees Celsius]" and one row with the value 30.
2. The second table has one column with the header "S [kJ/kg·K]" and one row with the value 0.

Graph Description:
The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The y-axis is labeled "T [degrees Celsius]" and starts from 30 going upwards. The x-axis is labeled "S [kJ/kg·K]" and extends from 0 to the right.

The graph contains six points labeled from 1 to 6. These points are connected in the following manner:
- Point 1 is located at the bottom left.
- Point 2 is directly above point 1.
- Point 3 is to the right of point 2.
- Point 4 is directly above point 3.
- Point 5 is to the right of point 4.
- Point 6 is directly below point 5.

The connections between the points are described as:
- The path from point 1 to point 2 is a vertical line labeled "isentrope".
- The path from point 2 to point 3 is a horizontal line labeled "isobare".
- The path from point 3 to point 4 is another vertical line labeled "isentrope".
- The path from point 4 to point 5 is a horizontal line labeled "isobare".
- The path from point 5 to point 6 is a vertical line labeled "isentrope".

Additionally, there is a label "IG - Air" near the top of the graph, and another label "isobare ps = pu" near the top right.
