Section d) Entropy balance:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between entropy s0 and s1, plus the sum of the heat transfer rate divided by temperature, plus the generated entropy rate.

The generated entropy rate divided by the mass flow rate equals the difference between entropy s0 and s1, which is negative 0.303 millijoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The exergy loss equals the reference temperature times the generated entropy rate, which is calculated as 273.15 Kelvin minus 30 degrees Celsius, all multiplied by negative 0.303 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

This results in negative 731.6 kilojoules per kilogram.
