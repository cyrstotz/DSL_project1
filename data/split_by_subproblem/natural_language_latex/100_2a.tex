For item (a), the equations and expressions are as follows:

- \( p_5 \) equals \( p_6 \) and \( p_c \) equals 1.

- The ratio of \( T_6 \) over \( T_5 \) is equal to the ratio of \( p_6 \) over \( p_5 \) raised to the power of \( \frac{0.4}{1.4} \).

- \( T_6 \) is equal to the ratio of \( p_6 \) over \( p_5 \) raised to the power of \( \frac{0.4}{1.4} \) times \( T_5 \).

- \( T_6 \) equals 328.07 Kelvin.

- The work \( w_{5/6} \) is equal to the gas constant \( R \) times the difference \( T_6 - T_5 \) divided by -0.4, and the result is underlined but not specified.

- The expression \( 7.87 \times 71.498 \frac{kJ}{kg} \) is given.

- The expression \( \frac{R}{2} \) is provided.

- The molar mass \( M \) is 28.97 kilograms per kilomole.

- The gas constant \( R \) is given as 28 plus the fraction \( \frac{1}{\log(1)} \).
