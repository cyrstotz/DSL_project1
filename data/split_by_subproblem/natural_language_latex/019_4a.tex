The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The y-axis is labeled P with units in bar. The x-axis is labeled T with units in Kelvin. The curve starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls back down, forming a closed loop. There are three points marked on the curve:
- Point 1 is at the lower left part of the curve.
- Point 2 is at the lower right part of the curve.
- Point 3 is at the top of the curve.
There is a horizontal line connecting points 1 and 2, labeled x. There is a vertical line from point 3 to the horizontal line, labeled y. The region inside the loop is labeled "2-Phasen" which translates to "Two-Phase".

The equation is E_k equals the ratio of Q dot zu over W dot t, which is equal to the ratio of Q dot zu over the difference of Q dot ab minus Q dot zu.
