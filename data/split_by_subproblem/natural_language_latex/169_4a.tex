Graph 1: A pressure-volume (p-v) diagram with a complex curve. The curve starts at the bottom left, rises steeply, then falls, rises again, and falls once more. There are four points marked on the curve:
- Point 1 is on the first rise.
- Point 2 is on the second rise.
- Point 3 is on the second fall.
- Point 4 is on the first fall.
There are horizontal lines connecting points 1 to 2 and 3 to 4, labeled as "isobar". The line connecting points 1 to 2 is labeled "x=0" at point 1 and "x=1" at point 2. The line connecting points 3 to 4 is labeled "p=5 bar". There is an arrow indicating the direction of the process from point 1 to point 2 and from point 3 to point 4.

Graph 2: A pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram with a dome-shaped curve. The curve starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls symmetrically. There are three points marked on the curve:
- Point 1 is on the left side of the dome.
- Point 2 is on the right side of the dome.
- Point 3 is at the peak of the dome.
There are horizontal lines connecting points 1 to 2 and 3 to 4, labeled as "isobar = 8 bar". The line connecting points 1 to 2 is labeled "x=0" at point 1 and "x=1" at point 2. There is an arrow indicating the direction of the process from point 1 to point 2.
