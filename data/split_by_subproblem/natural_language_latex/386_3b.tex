The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) equals \( T_{ew,1} \) which is 0 degrees Celsius. Since the ice does not completely melt, the temperature of the EW (presumably environmental water) remains constant and since the EW and gas are in equilibrium, they have the same temperature.

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) equals \( p_{g,1} \) which is 1.1 bar. This is because the external load on the membrane does not change (same mass and same water pressure), so the gas pressure remains constant.
