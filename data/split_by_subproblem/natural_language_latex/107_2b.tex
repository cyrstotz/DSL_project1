Omega six, T six, question mark?
The ratio of T two over T one equals the ratio of p two over p one raised to the power of (n minus one) over n, which equals the ratio of V one over V two raised to the power of n minus one.
The ratio of p six over p five equals the ratio of omega five over omega six raised to the power of 0.4.
The ratio of 0.19 bar over 0.5 bar raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 equals the ratio of 220 meters per second over omega six raised to the power of 0.4.
Omega six equals 437.471 meters per second.
n equals 1.4.
T six equals T five times the ratio of p six over p five raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4, which equals 431.15 Kelvin times the ratio of 0.19 over 0.5 raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4, resulting in 320.075 Kelvin.
