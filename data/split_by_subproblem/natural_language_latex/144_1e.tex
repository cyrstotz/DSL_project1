The change in entropy from state 1 to state 2, denoted as Delta S from 1 to 2, is equal to the sum of the total mass in state 1 and the specific heat capacity at constant pressure in state 2, all multiplied by the entropy in state 2, minus the total mass in state 1 multiplied by the entropy in state 1.

The entropy in state 1, s1, is 4.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and 1.377 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy in state 2, s2, is 0.254 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Therefore, the change in entropy from state 1 to state 2, Delta S from 1 to 2, is 1547.5 kilojoules per Kelvin.
