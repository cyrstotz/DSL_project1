The equations are as follows:

1. The rate of entropy generation plus the mass flow rate times the difference in entropy between exit and entrance plus the sum of the heat transfer rate divided by temperature.

2. The rate of entropy generation is zero.

3. The heat transfer rate out equals the mass flow rate times the difference in entropy between exit and entrance.

4. The ratio of the heat transfer rate out to itself equals negative one over the temperature.

5. The temperature equals the product of a constant and the difference between two temperatures, which equals the heat transfer rate out, divided by the product of the constant and the natural logarithm of the ratio of the two temperatures, which equals 7.12 Kelvin.
