The sum of mass flow rate times the expression in parentheses, which is negative T_c over T times heat flow rate plus the sum of work input minus the exergy loss rate.

The exergy loss rate is equal to the reference temperature times the entropy loss rate.

The entropy loss rate is equal to negative exergy destruction rate divided by temperature, given that 7 kilojoules per kilogram.

C equals negative change in exergy destruction plus the sum of the expression in parentheses, which is one minus T_c over T divided by T times heat flow rate, and this equals the sum of heat input rate over temperature minus the exergy loss rate.

The exergy loss rate equals negative change in exergy destruction.

This equals negative 207.48 kilojoules per kilogram.
