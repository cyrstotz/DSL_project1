The initial pressure \( p_0 \) is equal to \( mg \).

The force \( F \) is equal to the area \( A \) times the pressure \( p \).

The equation \( \frac{m \cdot g}{A} + 200000 \) pascals equals \( p_0 \) which leads to \( 190095 \) pascals, which is equivalent to \( 1.9 \) bar.

The area \( A \) is calculated as \( \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^2 \pi \) which equals \( 0.007853 \) square meters.

The equation \( \frac{pV}{RT} = m \) gives the mass \( m \) as \( 0.0034 \) kilograms, which is \( 3.4 \) grams.

The pressure \( p \) is \( 7.2 \) bar.

The volume \( V \) is \( 3.7 \) liters.

The temperature \( T \) is \( 400 \) Kelvin.

The gas constant \( R \) is given by \( \frac{R}{M} \).

The molar mass \( M \) is calculated as \( \frac{0.4 \) kilograms divided by \( \frac{V}{V_0} \).
