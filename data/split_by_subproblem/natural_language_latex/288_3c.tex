The change in internal energy from state 1 to 2 for gas is equal to the heat added, Q12.

The change in internal energy from state 1 to 2 is equal to the mass of the gas times the difference in specific internal energies from state 1 to 2, which is equal to the mass of the gas times the specific heat at constant volume times the difference in temperature from T2 to the initial temperature of the surroundings.

The temperature T2 is equal to the initial temperature of ice, which is 0 degrees Celsius, because the quality x2 is greater than 0 and there is thermal equilibrium.

The heat Q12 is equal to the mass of the gas times the specific heat at constant volume times the difference in temperature between the initial temperature of ice and the initial temperature of the gas, which calculates to approximately -0.8046 kilojoules.

The negative of Q12 flows into the ice.
