The equations provided are as follows:

1. The average temperature \( T_{KF} \) for a boiling liquid is given by the formula:
\[ T_{KF} = \frac{\int_{T_e}^{T} T \, dS}{S_{max} - S_{min}} \]

2. This is then expressed as:
\[ = \frac{1}{c^{ii}} \left( \frac{T_{aus}^3}{T_{ein}^3} \right) \]

3. Further simplified to:
\[ = \frac{S_e - T \, dS}{\int_{T_e}^{T} \frac{c^{ii}}{T} \, dT} \]

4. Then it is represented as:
\[ = \frac{T_e \int_{T_e}^{T} e^{\frac{S - S_e}{c^{ii}}} \, dS}{c^{ii} \ln \left( \frac{T_{max}}{T_{min}} \right)} \]

5. And further refined to:
\[ = \frac{T_e e^{\frac{S_e}{c^{ii}}} \left[ e^{\frac{S}{c^{ii}}} - e^{\frac{S_e}{c^{ii}}} \right]}{c^{ii} \ln \left( \frac{T_{max}}{T_{min}} \right)} \]

6. A relationship between entropy change and temperature is established:
\[ S - S_e = c^{ii} \ln \left( \frac{T}{T_e} \right) \Rightarrow T = T_e e^{\frac{S - S_e}{c^{ii}}} \]
