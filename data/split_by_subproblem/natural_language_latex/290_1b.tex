b) Exit of W6, T6 through a Venturi nozzle where the pressure P6 equals the ambient pressure P0, which is 0.196 bar.

The rate of change of mass times the specific enthalpy difference between state 6 and state 0 plus half the square of the velocity at state 6 is zero, expressed as:
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( m \left[ h_6 - h_0 + \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right] \right) = 0
\]

The enthalpy difference between state 5 and state 6 is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure times the temperature difference between state 5 and state 6. The temperature at state 6 is calculated using the Venturi effect, given by:
\[
h_5 - h_6 = c_p (T_5 - T_6), \quad T_6 = T_s \left( \frac{P_6}{P_5} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} \quad \text{with Venturi}
\]

The temperature at state 6 is calculated as:
\[
T_6 = 97.9 \left( \frac{0.196}{4.4} \right)^{\frac{2.4 - 1}{2.4}} = 328.07 K
\]

The enthalpy difference between state 5 and state 6 is:
\[
h_5 - h_6 = 109.46 \frac{kJ}{kg}
\]

The kinetic energy difference between state 5 and state 6 is half the mass times the difference in the squares of the velocities at state 5 and state 6. The square of the velocity at state 0 is not equal to 208.92 times 10 to the power of 7, and the velocity at state 5 is:
\[
k_{es} - k_{e6} = \frac{1}{2} m \left( w_5^2 - w_6^2 \right) \quad w_0^2 \neq 208.92 \cdot 10^7 \quad w_5 = 233.33 \frac{m}{s}
\]
