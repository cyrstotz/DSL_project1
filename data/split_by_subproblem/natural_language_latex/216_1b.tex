The average temperature T with subscript kF is equal to the integral from a to e of T ds, divided by the difference between s_e and s_a, which equals the change in h divided by the difference between s_e and s_a, which is further equal to h_a minus h_e divided by s_e minus s_a, and this results in 360.11 Kelvin.
