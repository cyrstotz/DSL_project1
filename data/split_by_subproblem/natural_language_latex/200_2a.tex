The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The y-axis is labeled as T in degrees Celsius. The x-axis is labeled as s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. There are several curves and points labeled on the graph:

- A curve starting from the bottom left, labeled "Pre-compressor" and "Compressor".
- A point labeled "0" at the bottom left.
- A point labeled "1" slightly above and to the right of point "0".
- A point labeled "2" further up and to the right of point "1".
- A point labeled "3" at the peak of the curve, labeled "Combustion chamber".
- A point labeled "4" to the right of point "3", labeled "Turbine".
- A point labeled "5" below point "4", labeled "Nozzle".
- A point labeled "6" to the left of point "5", labeled "0.197 bar".
- A horizontal line from point "6" to the left, labeled "-30 degrees Celsius".

The graph also includes several annotations:
- "Compression" with an arrow pointing downwards.
- "Compressor" with an arrow pointing to the right.
- "Isentropic" with an arrow pointing to the right.
- "Combustion chamber" with an arrow pointing upwards.
- "Turbine" with an arrow pointing downwards.
- "Adiabatic" with an arrow pointing downwards.
