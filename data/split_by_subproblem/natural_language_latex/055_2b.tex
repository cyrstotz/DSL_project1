Zero equals mass flow rate times the quantity of enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at entrance plus half the difference of the squares of velocity at exit and entrance plus gravitational acceleration times half the difference of elevation at exit and entrance, plus heat transfer rate minus the sum of work rates.

For stages 5 to 6, assuming isentropic conditions:

Zero equals mass flow rate times the quantity of enthalpy at stage 5 minus enthalpy at stage 6 plus half the difference of the squares of velocity at stage 5 and stage 6.

This equals total mass flow rate times the quantity of enthalpy at stage 5 minus enthalpy at stage 6 plus half the difference of the square of 220 meters per second and the square of velocity at stage 6.

We are looking for the difference in enthalpy between stage 5 and stage 6.

Air is considered an ideal gas with a specific heat capacity at constant pressure approximately equal to 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and for stages 5 to 6, which are isentropic, the ratio of specific heats is 1.4.

The difference in enthalpy between temperature at stage 5 and temperature at stage 6 is the specific heat capacity times the difference in temperature between stage 5 and stage 6.

This equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference between 431.9 Kelvin and temperature at stage 6.

We are looking for the velocity at stage 6.

For the entire system from stage 0 to 6,

Zero equals mass flow rate times the quantity of enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at entrance.

The difference in enthalpy between stage 6 and stage 5 equals half the difference of the square of 220 meters per second and the square of velocity at stage 6.

The temperature ratio between stage 5 and stage 6 equals the pressure ratio between stage 5 and stage 6 raised to the power of (n-1)/n, where n is the ratio of specific heats.

The temperature at stage 6 equals 431.8 Kelvin times the pressure ratio between stage 6 and stage 5 raised to the power of (k-1)/k, where k is the ratio of specific heats, equals approximately 0.759608.

The temperature at stage 6 equals approximately 328.0747 Kelvin.

The external energy difference equals the enthalpy at stage 6 minus the reference enthalpy minus the reference temperature times the difference in entropy between stage 6 and the reference condition plus kinetic energy term plus potential energy term.

The entropy difference between stage 6 and the reference condition equals the specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of the temperature ratio between stage 6 and the reference temperature minus the gas constant times the natural logarithm of the pressure ratio between stage 6 and the reference pressure.

The enthalpy difference between stage 6 and the reference condition equals the specific heat capacity times the temperature difference between stage 6 and the reference temperature.

The external energy difference equals the enthalpy difference minus the product of the reference temperature and the entropy difference plus half the difference of the squares of velocity at stage 6 and the reference velocity divided by 1000.

This equals approximately 125.47 kilojoules per kilogram.
