b)

- Temperature: Temperature \( T_{EU} \) implies that since \( x_{EU} > 0 \), there is still ice present, thus \( T_{EU} = 0^\circ C = T_f \).

- The pressures \( P_{gz} \) and \( P_{gn} \) are equal, ranging from 740 to 744 Pascals, approximately 744 bar. Since the external forces are equal, this is an isobaric expansion.

- The rate of change of energy with respect to time is given by:
  \[
  \frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_i (\dot{m}_i (u_i + \frac{p_i}{\rho_i})) + \sum Q_i - \sum W_i
  \]

- The change in energy is:
  \[
  \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = \sum Q_i - \sum W_i
  \]

- Initial energy \( E_1 \) is:
  \[
  E_1 = U + \frac{pV}{\rho} = u_1
  \]

- The difference \( E_2 - u_1 \) is calculated, and the change in internal energy \( u_2 - u_1 \) is given by:
  \[
  u_2 - u_1 = C_v (T_2 - T_1) = Q - W_v
  \]

- Volume work \( W_v \) is calculated as:
  \[
  W_v = \int_{V_1}^{V_2} p \, dV = P_{gz} (V_2 - V_1) = 285.83 \, J
  \]

- The final volume \( V_2 \) is:
  \[
  V_2 = \frac{mRT}{p} = 0.0011 \, m^3
  \]

- The heat \( Q \) is:
  \[
  Q = C_v (0^\circ - (1500^\circ C + 273.15^\circ C)) = -285.83 \, J
  \]
  \[
  = -775.23 \, J
  \]
