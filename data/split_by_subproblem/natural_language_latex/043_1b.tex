The rate of change of temperature in the cooling jacket, denoted as T with a dot subscript KF, is given by the integral from e to a of T ds divided by the difference s_a minus s_e.

The integral of T ds equals the reversible heat, q_rev, which is equal to h_a minus h_e.

The rate of change of temperature in the cooling jacket, for an ideal fluid, is then given by (h_a minus h_e) divided by (s_a minus s_e).

The pressure in the cooling jacket does not change.

The rate of change of temperature in the cooling jacket can also be expressed as C_p times (T_a minus T_e) divided by C_p times the natural logarithm of (T_a divided by T_e), which simplifies to (T_a minus T_e) divided by the natural logarithm of (T_a divided by T_e).

The temperature T_a is 298.15 Kelvin.

The temperature T_e is 288.15 Kelvin.

The rate of change of temperature in the cooling jacket is calculated to be 293.121 Kelvin.
