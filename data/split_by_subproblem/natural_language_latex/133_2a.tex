The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The plot starts at point 0, then moves to point 1, then to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 4. The curve from point 3 to point 4 is a downward curve. There is a shaded area under the curve from point 3 to point 4.
