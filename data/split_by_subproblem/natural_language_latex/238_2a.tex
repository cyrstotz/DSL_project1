Graph Description:

The graph is a Temperature (T) versus Entropy (s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled 's' in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled 'T' in Kelvin. There are six points labeled from 1 through 6. The process from point 1 to point 2 is a vertical line representing an isobar, from point 2 to point 3 is a curved line representing an adiabatic process, from point 3 to point 4 is another vertical line representing an isobar, from point 4 to point 5 is another curved line representing an adiabatic process, and from point 5 to point 6 is another vertical line representing an isobar. There is a small cycle labeled "C" with a note "as it actually proceeds" and an isotherm line.
