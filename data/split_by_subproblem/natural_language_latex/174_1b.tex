The average temperature T-bar with subscript KF is given by the formula:

T-bar with subscript KF equals the integral from S-a to S-c of T dS divided by S-a minus S-c, which equals the change in enthalpy Delta h divided by c-if times the natural logarithm of T2 over T1, which simplifies to c-if times T2 minus T1 divided by c-if times the natural logarithm of T2 over T1.

This further simplifies to T2 minus T1 divided by the natural logarithm of T2 over T1, which equals 298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of 298.15 Kelvin over 288.15 Kelvin.

Finally, the average temperature T-bar with subscript KF equals 293.12 Kelvin.
