Q12 equals Delta E12, which is equal to Qu2 minus W12. W12 equals pg1 times the difference between Vg2 and Vg1. Vg2 is calculated as mg1 divided by (R over MS times Tg2) times pg2, which equals 3.41 grams divided by (8.314 kilojoules per kilomole Kelvin over 50 kilograms per kilomole) times 273.15 Kelvin times 135.97 kilopascals, resulting in 0.004105 cubic meters. Therefore, W12 equals 135.97 kilopascals times (0.004105 cubic meters minus 0.00314 cubic meters), which equals negative 0.2582 kilojoules. Consequently, Delta E12 equals Delta U12, which is equal to mg1 times (ug2 minus ug1) plus mg2 times (ug2 minus ug1).
