Item b) consists of two parts:

1. Equations:
   - \( T_1 \) equals negative 26 degrees Celsius.
   - \( T_4 \) equals \( T_2 \) which is negative 32 degrees Celsius.

2. A table with columns labeled T, P, V, x, Q, and W:
   - Row 1: T equals 1, P equals \( T_1 \) which is negative 6, V equals P, and the other columns are empty.
   - Row 2: T equals 2, P equals \( T_1 \) which is negative 6, V equals P, x equals 1, and W equals \( w_{23} \) which is 28W; the Q column is empty.
   - Row 3: T equals 3, V equals 8, and the other columns are empty.
   - Row 4: T equals 4, V equals 8, x equals 0, and the other columns are empty.
