c) Closed system in a piston with initial pressure \( p_0 \), kinetic energy equals zero. The change in energy is given by \( \Delta E = \xi_j Q - \xi_u W_u = \xi_j Q_j - \xi_u W_u \). The equation \( m c_p (T_2 - T_1) = \xi_j Q - W_u \) relates the mass, specific heat at constant pressure, and temperature change to the heat and work. The heat \( Q \) is expressed as \( Q = \xi_j m c_p (T_2 - T_1) \). The heat of the water \( Q_{\text{Wasser}} \) is equal to the negative of the heat of the gas \( Q_{\text{gas}} \), which equals \( 13.66 \, kJ \). The temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are equal according to Table 1.
