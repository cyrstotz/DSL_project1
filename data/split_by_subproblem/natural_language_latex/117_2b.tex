Question about w_6 and stating that P_6 equals P_0.

Energy equation from 5 to 6, static FP:
The equation is zero equals m dot g times the quantity h_5 minus h_6 plus half the difference of w_5 squared and w_6 squared, plus g times the difference z_5 minus z_6, plus dot q minus dot w_T. Simplifying, zero equals m dot g times the quantity h_5 minus h_6 plus half the difference of w_5 squared and w_6 squared. This implies that w_6 squared equals w_5 squared minus two times the difference h_5 minus h_6, and rearranging gives w_6 squared equals two times the difference h_5 minus h_6 plus w_5 squared.

From 5 to 6, isentropic process where n equals 1.4:
The ratio T_6 over T_5 equals the ratio P_6 over P_5 raised to the power of (n-1) over n, which implies T_6 equals T_5 times the ratio P_6 over P_5 raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4. Calculating with T_5 as 437.9 Kelvin and the pressure ratio as 0.791 bar over 0.5 bar, T_6 equals 328.0747 Kelvin.

This implies that w_6 squared equals two times the quantity h_5 minus h_6 plus w_5 squared, which equals two times c_p times the difference T_5 minus T_6 plus w_5 squared. Calculating w_6, it equals the square root of two times 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference 437.9 Kelvin minus 328.0747 Kelvin plus 220 meters per second squared, resulting in w_6 equals 234.453 meters per second.
