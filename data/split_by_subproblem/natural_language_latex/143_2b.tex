The enthalpy at state s, denoted as h_s, is equal to the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, c_p, multiplied by the temperature at state s, T_s, which equals 431.49 kilojoules per kilogram.

The energy balance for the nozzle, which is adiabatic, shows that the heat transfer Q equals zero and the system is steady.

The equation for the system is zero equals the mass flow rate, denoted as dot m with subscript ges, times the quantity of enthalpy at state 5 minus enthalpy at state 6 plus one-half the square of velocity at state 5 minus one-half the square of velocity at state 6.

From this, it follows that the enthalpy at state 6, h_6, equals the enthalpy at state 5, h_5, plus one-half times the difference between the square of velocity at state 5 and the square of velocity at state 6, according to the ideal gas law.

For the condition T_0, the process from s to s is isentropic, implying that the polytropic exponent n equals the specific heat ratio k.

The polytropic temperature ratio is given by the temperature at state 6, T_6, equals the temperature at state s, T_s, times the ratio of pressure at state 0 to pressure at state s raised to the power of (k-1) divided by k, which results in 293.9 Kelvin, where the enthalpy at state 6, h_6, equals the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, c_p, times the temperature at state 6, T_6.

It follows that the velocity at state 6, w_6, equals the square root of two times the difference between the enthalpy at state s and the enthalpy at state 6 plus the square of the velocity at state 5, which equals 571 meters per second.
