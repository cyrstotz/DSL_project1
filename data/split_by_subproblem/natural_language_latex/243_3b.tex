The atmospheric pressure \( P_{atm} \) is equal to \( P_0 \) plus the ratio of \( N_g \) over \( A \), which calculates to \( 7.105P_0 \) plus \( (32 \times 0.12) \) times \( \frac{3.87}{3.7} \), resulting in \( 7.16 \) grams.

The pressure \( P_2 \) is calculated by subtracting \( P_0 \) from \( P_{atm} \) and then adding \( 7.5 \) centimeters and subtracting \( 7.5 \) centimeters, which results in \( 0 \) centimeters.

The minimum volume \( V_{min} \) is given by the formula \( \frac{m \cdot R \cdot T}{P} \).
