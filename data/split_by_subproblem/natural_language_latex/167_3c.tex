The change in internal energy due to geothermal processes, denoted as Delta U_geo, is equal to the heat added, Q, minus the work done, w. This is expressed as:
Delta U_geo equals m times v times the difference in temperature from T_1 to T_2, which equals 70837.

The volume V_2 is given by the formula:
V_2 equals m times R times T_2 divided by P, which equals 0.00711 cubic meters.

From this, we can calculate the heat added, Q, as follows:
Q equals 70837 plus 1.4 times the difference between 3.14 and 1.11 cubic meters per cubic meter, which results in 7367.2 Joules, and this value is equal to Q.
