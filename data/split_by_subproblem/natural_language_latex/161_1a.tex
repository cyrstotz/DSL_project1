Energy balance stationary

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat flow rate added, with no work being done.

From Table A-2,

The enthalpy at the inlet, at 70 degrees Celsius, is 2337 kilojoules per kilogram and 232.95 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at the outlet, at 100 degrees Celsius, is 2217 kilojoules per kilogram and 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat flow rate added equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet.

The heat flow rate added equals 0.1 kilograms per second times the sum of 2217 and 2337 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 23.04 kilojoules per second.

The heat flow rate added equals 37.82 kilowatts.
