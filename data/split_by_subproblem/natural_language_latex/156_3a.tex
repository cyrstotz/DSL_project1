The density of gas \( p_{g1} \) is equal to the mass of the gas \( m_g \) divided by the volume of the gas \( V_g \).

The equation \( (m_k + m_{EW})g + p_0 A = p_{g1} A \) is labeled as equation (1).

With \( A \) being equal to \( \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2 \pi \) which simplifies to \( \frac{\pi}{400} \).

The expression \( \frac{(m_k + m_{EW})g}{A} \) equals 1.401 bar.

The conditions in part a) are the same for part b).

It implies that \( \frac{p_{g12} V_{g12}}{T_{g12}} = \frac{p_{g1} V_{g1}}{T_{g1}} \).

It further implies that \( \frac{T_{g12}}{T_{g1}} = \left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^{n-1} \).

Thus, \( T_{g12} \) equals \( T_{g1} \left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^{n-1} \) as labeled in equation (2).

The product \( p_{z1g} V_{g12} \) equals \( m_g R T_{g12} \), which implies \( V_{g12} = \frac{m_g R T_{g12}}{p_{z1g}} \) as labeled in equation (3).

Substituting equation (3) into equation (2) gives \( T_{g12} = T_{g1} \frac{m_g R T_{g12}}{p_{z1g} V_1} \).

\( T_{S12} \) is equal to 0.003 degrees Celsius.

For part a), calculate \( x_{EIS,12} \).

\( T_{EN,12} \) is equal to 0.003 degrees Celsius.

For energy work (EW):
The change in internal energy \( U_2 - U_1 \) equals the negative of the heat transfer \( -Q_{12} \), which implies \( U_2 = U_1 - Q_{12} \) and further simplifies to \( U_2 = u_1 - \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{EW}} \).

With \( x_1 = 0.6 \) and \( T_{EW1} = 0^\circ \).

From Table 1, \( U_1 \) is calculated as \( u_f + x \cdot (u_g - u_f) = -133.41 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).

Thus, \( U_2 = U_1 - \frac{Q_{12}}{m_{EW}} = -122.5805 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).

From Table 1, \( x_2 \) is calculated as \( \frac{U_2 - u_f}{u_g - u_f} = \frac{0.9888}{} \).
