The graph description states that the graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as 'p' in Pascals and the horizontal axis labeled as 'T' in Kelvin. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is connected to point 2 with a horizontal line, point 2 is connected to point 3 with a diagonal line, point 3 is connected to point 4 with a horizontal line, and point 4 is connected back to point 1 with a vertical line.
