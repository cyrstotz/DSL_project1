The expression \( x_{e1,2} > 0 \) implies that water is still in the solid-liquid region.

The temperature of the gas will be at \(0^\circ \text{C}\), and the gas will continue to transfer heat to the water as long as the temperature of the gas is higher than that of the water.

The pressure of the gas will be the same as in state 1. It must still counteract the gravitational forces and atmospheric pressure.
