The temperature \( T_{HF} \) is equal to 298 Kelvin.

The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference between \( s_e \) and \( s_a \) plus the sum of \( \frac{\dot{Q}_j}{T} \) plus the generated entropy \( \dot{S}_{erz} \).

The generated entropy \( \dot{S}_{erz} \) equals negative mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference between \( s_e \) and \( s_a \) minus the sum of \( \frac{\dot{Q}_j}{T} \).
