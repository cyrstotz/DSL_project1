The volume \( V_{e2} \) is equal to the fraction of \( M_e \) times \( R \) times \( T_{e2} \) over \( p_{e2} \), which equals 1.871 liters.

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is equal to \( Q \) minus \( W \). The heat \( Q \) is equal to \( \Delta U \) plus \( W \) minus 2233.02 joules. The absolute value of \( Q_{21} \) is 2233.02 joules.

The work \( W \) is equal to the integral from \( V_1 \) to \( V_2 \) of \( p \) times \( dV \), which simplifies to \( p \) times \( (V_2 - V_1) \), resulting in -466.62 joules. The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is equal to \( m_e \) times \( c_v \) times \( (T_2 - T_1) \), resulting in -1772.4 joules.
