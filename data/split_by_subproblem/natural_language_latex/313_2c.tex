The equations provided are as follows:

For subtask c):
1. The equation is zero subscript ex, st equals h subscript e minus h subscript a minus T subscript 0 times (S minus S subscript e) plus delta ke.
2. This is equal to C subscript p times (T subscript e minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript e times (S over T) subscript out plus delta ke.
3. This simplifies to 2 times C subscript p times q subscript C times underline (6 over k) subscript k equals 8.
4. It is noted that "adiabat 8 does no work" in German, which translates to "adiabatic 8 does no work."

For subtask e):
1. The equation Q equals e subscript x, stc minus W subscript tn minus dot e subscript x, os.
2. It is noted that "adiabat Q station√§r" in German, which translates to "adiabatic Q is stationary."
