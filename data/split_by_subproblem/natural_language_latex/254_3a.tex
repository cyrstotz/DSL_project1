R_g equals the fraction of 8.314 Joules per mole Kelvin divided by 56, which equals 0.1662 Joules per gram Kelvin.

p_{3,1} equals p_{ambient} plus the fraction of the sum of m_K and m_ew divided by A times g, which equals p_{ambient} plus the fraction of the sum of m_K and m_ew divided by Delta t times g, which equals 1.1 bar.

m_{g,1} equals the inverse of the fraction R_g times T_1 divided by p_{3,1} times V_n, which equals the inverse of the fraction 0.1662 Joules per gram Kelvin times 293.15 Kelvin divided by 1.1 times 10^5 Pascals times 3.19 times 10^-2 cubic meters, which equals 3.419 times 10^-2 kilograms, which equals 3.419 grams.
