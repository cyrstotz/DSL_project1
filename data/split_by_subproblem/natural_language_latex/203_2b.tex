p_5 equals 0.5 bar,
p_6 equals 0.197 bar,
T_5 equals 437.9 Kelvin,
w_5 equals 220 meters per second.

The change in enthalpy from state 5 to state 6 is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure times the change in temperature from T_5 to T_6.
The ratio of T_6 to T_5 is equal to the ratio of p_6 to p_5 raised to the power of (n-1) divided by n. Therefore, T_6 equals T_5 times the ratio of p_6 to p_5 raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4, which calculates to 328.075 Kelvin.

For the first law of thermodynamics over the nozzle:
The rate of heat transfer equals the mass flow rate times the sum of the change in enthalpy plus the change in kinetic energy divided by 2.
Setting this equation to zero, we find that the mass flow rate times the sum of the change in enthalpy from state 5 to state 6 plus the change in kinetic energy from w_5 to w_6 divided by 2 equals zero.
Solving for w_6 squared, we get twice the change in enthalpy from state 5 to state 6 plus w_5 squared.
w_6 equals the square root of twice the specific heat at constant pressure times the change in temperature from T_5 to T_6 plus w_5 squared. This calculates to 507.29 meters per second.
