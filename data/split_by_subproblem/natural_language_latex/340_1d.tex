The rate of change of energy E with respect to time t is equal to the mass flow rate at point 1 times the enthalpy at point 1 plus the heat transfer rate minus the work rate.

The change in internal energy U is equal to the mass flow rate at point 1 times the enthalpy at point 1 plus the heat transfer rate.

The mass at point 1 times the internal energy at point 1 equals the mass at point 2 times the enthalpy at point 2 plus the mass flow rate at point 1 times the enthalpy at point 1 minus the heat transfer rate.

The change in mass is equal to the mass at point 1 times the internal energy at point 1 minus the mass at point 2 times the enthalpy at point 2.

The mass at point 2 is equal to the mass at point 1 plus the change in mass.

The mass flow rate at point 1 times the enthalpy at point 1 minus the heat transfer rate equals the mass at point 2 times the enthalpy at point 2 minus the mass at point 1 times the internal energy at point 1.

The change in mass is equal to the mass at point 1 times the internal energy at point 1 minus the mass at point 2 times the enthalpy at point 2, all divided by the difference between the specific volume at point 2 and the enthalpy at point 2.
