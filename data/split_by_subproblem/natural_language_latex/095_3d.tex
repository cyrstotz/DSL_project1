The equation for \( X_{eis,2} \) is crossed out and given as \( X_{eis,2} = \frac{w_1 - w_{rig}}{m_2} \).

The new equation for \( X_{eis,2} \) is \( X_{eis,2} = \frac{w_{1} e_{s}}{w_{eis} + w_{f}} \) which equals \( \frac{w_{eis}}{0.1 \, t_{g}} \).

There is a diagram described as a horizontal arrow pointing to the right labeled \( \vec{u}_{ew} \).

The vector \( \vec{u}_{ew} \) is defined as \( \vec{u}_{fes} + \vec{u}_{fes} \times \left( \frac{u_{fes}}{u_{fes}} \right) \).

In Table 1, \( \vec{u}_{ew} \) is calculated as \( -3.37 \left( \frac{u_{g} t_{g}}{t_{g}} \right) + X \cdot \left( -2.000 \cdot 0.333 \cdot 0.500 \right) \).
