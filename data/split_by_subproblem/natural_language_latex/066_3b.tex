The equation rho_l times V equals m_g times R times T can be rearranged to m_g equals rho_l times V divided by R times T, with R equal to 8.314 Joules per mole Kelvin and M equal to 50 grams per mole. Substituting the values, m_g equals 4.12 times 10 to the power of 5 times 0.03 divided by 8.314 times 300. This calculation results in m_g equals 164.9 grams, which is equal to 73.15 grams.
