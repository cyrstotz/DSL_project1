The efficiency epsilon subscript N is equal to the absolute value of Q dot subscript zu divided by the absolute value of W dot, minus the absolute value of Q dot subscript ab divided by the difference of the absolute values of Q dot subscript zu and Q dot subscript ab.

Q dot subscript ab equals m dot subscript R134a times the difference of h subscript 3 and h subscript 1.

Zero equals m dot subscript R134a times the difference of h subscript 3 and h subscript 2 plus Q dot subscript ab, which implies that Q dot subscript ab equals m dot subscript R134a times the difference of h subscript 4 and h subscript 3.

Zero equals m dot subscript R134a times the difference of h subscript 1 and h subscript 2 plus Q dot subscript ab, which implies that Q dot subscript ab equals m dot subscript R134a times the difference of h subscript 2 and h subscript 1.

The efficiency epsilon subscript N is equal to the absolute value of the difference of h subscript 3 and h subscript 1 divided by the difference of the absolute values of h subscript 3 minus h subscript 1 and h subscript 2 minus h subscript 1.
