c) Throttle expands isenthalpically

- The enthalpy at point q equals the enthalpy at fluid state at 8 bar, which is 264.1 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The mass flow rate L_m equals the enthalpy at fluid state at 2 bar plus the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at mixed state at 2 bar and the enthalpy at fluid state at 1 bar. This simplifies to the ratio of (enthalpy at mixed state minus enthalpy at fluid state) over (enthalpy at mixed state minus enthalpy at fluid state).

Listed items:
- The temperature T_z is minus 22 degrees Celsius.
- The heat transfer Q equals the ratio of pressure p1 over pressure p2, which is 2 bar.
