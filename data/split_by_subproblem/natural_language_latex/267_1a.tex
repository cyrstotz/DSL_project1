Item a) describes an energy balance equation labeled as E - 3.1, which is for a system that is isothermal and isochoric, meaning the process is at constant temperature and volume. The equation is:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in specific enthalpy at the inlet and the outlet, plus the heat transfer rate out of the system, plus the heat transfer rate due to radiation.

The specific enthalpy at the inlet, denoted as h-hat at the inlet, for a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius is 292.78 kilojoules per kilogram.

The specific enthalpy at the outlet, denoted as h-hat at the outlet, for a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat transfer rate out of the system, denoted as Q-dot at the outlet, is 62.782 kilowatts.
