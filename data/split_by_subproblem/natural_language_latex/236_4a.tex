Description:
- Graph 1: A graph with p (in millibar) on the y-axis and T (in degrees Celsius) on the x-axis. The graph displays a curve that begins at the bottom left, rises steeply, then levels off, and finally rises steeply again. There are two points marked on the curve, labeled (i) and (ii), connected by a horizontal line labeled "isobar".
  
- Graph 2: A graph with p (in millibar) on the y-axis and T (in degrees Celsius) on the x-axis. The graph shows a curve that starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls back down. There are two points marked on the curve, labeled (i) at the peak and (ii) at the bottom left.
