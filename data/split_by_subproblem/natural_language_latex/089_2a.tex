Graph description: The graph is a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram with the x-axis labeled as s [u cubed divided by u times k] and the y-axis labeled as T [u]. There are six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by lines indicating different processes:

- Point 1 to Point 2: Isentropic process
- Point 2 to Point 3: Isobaric process
- Point 3 to Point 4: Isentropic process
- Point 4 to Point 5: Isobaric process
- Point 5 to Point 6: Isentropic process

The graph also includes curves labeled as "isobaric" and "isentropic".
