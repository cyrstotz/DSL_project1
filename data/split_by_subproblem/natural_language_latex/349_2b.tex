Energy balance (steady flow process)

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the quantity of (enthalpy at point zero minus enthalpy at point six plus the difference between the square of the running speed and the square of the speed at point six, all divided by two), plus the heat input times the mass of component K.

The mass of component K equals one divided by 5.293 times the mass of component M.

The enthalpy at point zero, h_0, is the enthalpy at temperature T_0, which is 243.15 Kelvin.

The enthalpy at point zero is calculated as the enthalpy at 240 Kelvin plus the difference between the enthalpy at 250 Kelvin and the enthalpy at 240 Kelvin, divided by the difference between 250 and 240, all multiplied by the difference between 243.15 and 240.

This results in 243.18 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at point five is calculated as the enthalpy at 430 Kelvin plus the difference between the enthalpy at 440 Kelvin and the enthalpy at 430 Kelvin, divided by the difference between 440 and 430, all multiplied by the difference between 471.9 and 430.

This results in 433.37 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at point six equals the enthalpy at point zero.

Thus, zero equals the mass flow rate times the quantity of (the difference between the square of the running speed and the square of the speed at point six, all divided by two), plus the heat input times the mass of component K.

The speed at point six equals the square root of (two times the heat input times the mass of component K divided by the mass flow rate plus the square of the running speed).
