Subsection b) Reason 1: The heat flow out, denoted as Q-dot-out, equals 6 kW because:

The heat flow out, Q-dot-out, is equal to the integral from initial entropy s_a to final entropy s_e of the temperature T with respect to entropy s.

T_ds equals T_ds plus the product of mass flow rate dot-m and volume flow rate dot-V, which equals the difference in enthalpy h_a minus h_e divided by the difference in entropy s_a minus s_e.

For the ideal fluid model:
The difference in enthalpy h_a minus h_e equals the product of specific heat at constant pressure c_p^i and the temperature difference T_a minus T_e, plus the product of specific volume v and the pressure difference p_a minus p_e.

For the material model:
The difference in entropy s_a minus s_e equals the integral from final temperature T_e to initial temperature T_a of the specific heat at constant pressure c_p^i divided by temperature T, integrated with respect to temperature dT, plus the integral from final pressure p_e to initial pressure p_a of specific volume v divided by temperature T, integrated with respect to pressure dp.

This equals c_p^i times the natural logarithm of the ratio T_a over T_e.

This further simplifies to the ratio of the temperature difference T_a minus T_e to c_p^i times the natural logarithm of the ratio T_a over T_e, which equals the difference 288.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of the ratio 288.15 to 288.15, resulting in -293.12 kilojoules per Kelvin.
