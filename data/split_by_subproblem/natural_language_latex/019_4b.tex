Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry, plus the heat transfer rate, minus the work transfer rate.

- We look at 2 to 3.
- Adiabatic, reversible, leads to bentos.
- The pressure at state 3 equals 8 bar, the temperature at state 3 equals.
- The entropy at state 3 equals the entropy at state 2.
