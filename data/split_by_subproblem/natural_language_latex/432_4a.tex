The graph described is a Pressure-Temperature diagram, abbreviated as P-T diagram. The x-axis represents Temperature, denoted as T, and the y-axis represents Pressure, denoted as P. The graph features a curve that begins at the origin and ascends towards the upper right. On this curve, three points are identified: Point 1 is positioned at the lower left, Point 2 in the middle, and Point 3 at the upper right. There are two horizontal lines, both labeled "isobar". One connects Point 1 to Point 2, and the other connects Point 2 to Point 3. Additionally, there are two vertical lines, both labeled "isotherm". One connects Point 2 to another point labeled 2', and the other connects Point 3 to another point labeled 3'. Both points 2' and 3' are located on the curve.
