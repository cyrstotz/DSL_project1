The rate of change of energy, denoted as E dot subscript x, equals the rate of heat input, Q dot subscript zu, divided by the temperature T subscript w, e. This is calculated as one kilojoule per one Kelvin, which equals one point two kilowatts divided by two hundred seventy-three Kelvin, resulting in zero point four two nine.
