Lambda equals the ratio of R bar over M, which is 461.289 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.
A equals pi times d squared over 4, which equals 0.00785 square meters.
The product of p_g2 and V_g2 equals the sum of m_EW plus m_g times R bar times T_1 plus p_amb, which equals 7.4 bar.
The product of p_g2 and V_g2 equals m_g times the ratio of R bar times T_1 over lambda, which implies m_g equals the ratio of p_g2 times V_g2 over lambda times T_1, approximately 3.429 grams.
