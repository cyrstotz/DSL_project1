Balance: zero equals the mass flow rate in times enthalpy in minus the mass flow rate out times enthalpy out plus the heat flow rate out plus the heat flow rate R. This implies that the heat flow rate out equals the mass flow rate out times enthalpy out minus the mass flow rate in times enthalpy in minus the heat flow rate R.

The enthalpy in equals the enthalpy at fluid state at 70 degrees Celsius plus specific volume times the flow rate times the difference between pressure and internal pressure. The enthalpy out equals the enthalpy at fluid state at 100 degrees Celsius plus specific volume times the flow rate times the difference between pressure and internal pressure.

This implies the heat flow rate out equals.
