With the steady state exergy rate, denoted as e-dot with subscript ex,st, equal to 200 kilojoules per kilogram,

the equation for the steady state exergy rate is given by:
e-dot with subscript ex,st equals e-dot with subscript ex,st plus the quantity one minus the ratio of T-zero over T-j times q_B,

which equals 1065.8 kilojoules per kilogram.

Here, q_B equals 745.5 kilojoules per kilogram,
T-zero equals 298.15 Kelvin,
and T-j equals 1283.2 Kelvin.

Finally, e-dot with subscript ex,st equals 36.26 kilojoules per kilogram.
