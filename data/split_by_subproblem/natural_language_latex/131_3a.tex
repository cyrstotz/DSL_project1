The graph description is as follows: The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as P and the x-axis labeled as T L. There are two main curves on the graph. The first curve starts from the origin and rises linearly. The second curve starts from a point on the y-axis and rises more steeply. There are two horizontal dashed lines labeled "Triple point" and "something below the triple point". There are three points marked on the graph: point 1 on the steeper curve, point 2 on the linear curve, and point 3 on the y-axis. There is an arrow labeled "isobar" pointing horizontally from point 3 to point 2, and another arrow labeled "isotherm" pointing vertically from point 2 to point 1.
