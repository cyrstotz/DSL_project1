The graph is described as a pressure-volume diagram with the x-axis labeled as entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (s (kJ/kgÂ·K)) and the y-axis labeled as temperature in Kelvin (T (K)). The graph features a closed loop with six points labeled from 1 to 6. The process between points 1 and 2 is labeled as "constant entropy s, reversible adiabatic". The process between points 2 and 3 is labeled as "isobaric". The process between points 3 and 4 is labeled as "adiabatic irreversible". The process between points 4 and 5 is also labeled as "adiabatic irreversible". The process between points 5 and 6 is labeled as "isobaric". The process between points 6 and 1 is labeled as "constant entropy s". The pressures at points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are noted as follows: the pressure at points 1 and 6 is 0.1916 bar, the pressure at points 2 and 3 are equal, and the pressure at point 5 is 0.5 bar.
