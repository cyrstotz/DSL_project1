The derivative of E with respect to t equals the sum over i of the product of m dot i and the difference between h2 and h1, minus the sum over i of Q sub i, minus the sum over i of m dot i.

Q equals the product of m dot i and the difference between h3 and h2, plus the dot of W sub k.

The dot of m sub 2 plus 3 plus 4 equals the negative of the ratio of the dot of W sub k to the difference between h3 and h2.

h3 approaches a constant times Delta Z.
