The subsection is titled "d) stationary flow processes".

The first equation is:
Q equals m dot times the quantity m dot times the quantity e sub x1str plus the quantity 1 minus T0 divided by T, minus V dot times T, minus E dot sub x1str.

The second equation is:
E sub x1str equals e sub x1str plus V dot times T.

The third equation is:
W sub r equals the integral from v0 to v2 of rho times dp plus delta ke plus delta e.

The fourth equation is:
W sub e equals the integral from 0 to n of rho times dv minus the quantity v2 squared minus v0 squared divided by 2, which equals rho0 times n times the quantity v0 minus v2 minus the quantity v2 squared minus v0 squared divided by 2.

For v1 and v0, see the task.
