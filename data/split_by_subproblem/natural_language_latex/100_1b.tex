The average temperature T_KF is equal to the fraction where the numerator is c times m times the difference T_2 minus T_1, and the denominator is c times m times the natural logarithm of the fraction T_2 over T_1. Here, c and m are cancelled out in both the numerator and the denominator. This results in the value 293.12.
