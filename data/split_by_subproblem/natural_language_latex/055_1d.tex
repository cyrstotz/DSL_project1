Zero equals the mass flow rate times the quantity of enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at entrance times the quantity of the difference in square of velocity at exit and velocity at entrance divided by two, plus gravitational acceleration times the difference in height from exit to entrance, plus the sum of heat transfer minus the sum of work done.

State 1: The temperature T1 is 100 degrees Celsius.

State 2: The temperature T2 is 70 degrees Celsius.

The entering temperature is 20 degrees Celsius.

For the hot system: The change in energy Delta E equals m2 times u2 minus m1 times u1, which equals the sum over mi times the quantity of hi plus the square of vi divided by two.

The change in entropy Delta S equals m2 times S2 minus m1 times S1, which equals the sum over dm_i times S_i plus the sum of Qi divided by Ti plus the entropy of the environment.

m02 times the sum of m1 and m412 times S2 minus m1 times S1 equals dm12 times S12 plus Q412 divided by T plus the entropy of the environment.
