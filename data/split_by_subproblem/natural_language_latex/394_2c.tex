The change in energy, denoted as delta e subscript x,1s+6, is equal to e subscript x,1s+6 minus e subscript x,1s+0. This is calculated as h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus ke, where ke is defined as w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2. This expression can also be written as C subscript p times (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript 0 times (C subscript p times the natural logarithm of T subscript 6 over T subscript 0 minus R times the natural logarithm of p subscript 6 over p subscript 0) plus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2.
