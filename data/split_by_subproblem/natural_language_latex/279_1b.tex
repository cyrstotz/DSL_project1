The average temperature T-bar is equal to the integral from s_e to s_a of T ds, divided by s_a minus s_e, which equals c_p times the difference between T_a and T_e, divided by c_p times the natural logarithm of T_a over T_e, which equals 293.12 Kelvin.

T_a, which is the temperature at K,aus, equals 288.15 Kelvin.

T_e, which is the temperature at K,ein, equals 288.15 Kelvin.
