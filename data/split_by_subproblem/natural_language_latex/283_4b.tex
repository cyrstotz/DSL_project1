- A graph with the vertical axis labeled P and the unit [mbar].
- The horizontal axis is labeled T with the unit [K].
- The graph shows a curve that starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls off to the right.
- There are three points labeled 1, 2, and 3.
- Point 1 is on the curve at the peak.
- Point 2 is to the left of the peak on the curve.
- Point 3 is below point 2 on the vertical line.
- A horizontal dashed line extends from point 1 to the right, labeled 10 mbar.
- Another horizontal dashed line extends from point 2 to the right, labeled 5 mbar.
- The term "isobaric cooling" is written near the top of the graph.
- The term "isothermal" is written near the bottom left of the graph.

Energy balance around the compressor:
The net power input equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between point 2 and point 3, expressed as:
Net power input equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy at point 2 minus enthalpy at point 3).
