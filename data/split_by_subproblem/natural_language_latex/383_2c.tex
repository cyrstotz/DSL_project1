The change in specific exergy due to irreversibility, denoted as delta e subscript x comma istr, is equal to the rate of exergy change divided by the total mass flow rate, which is expressed as h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times the difference s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0.

The difference s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0 is equal to s superscript 0 of T subscript 6 minus s superscript 0 of T subscript 0 minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of P subscript 6 to P subscript 0, which equals zero.

The difference h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 is equal to 189.88 kilojoules per kilogram, as found from part b of the task.
