The section contains two diagrams placed side by side. Each diagram is a rectangle with a horizontal line dividing it into two parts. In both diagrams, the top label inside the rectangle reads "p_ew times A". The left diagram has a bottom label "p_g,1 times A" and a left label "m_ew times g". The right diagram has a bottom label "p_0 times A" and a left label "m_g times g".

Following the diagrams, there are equations:
1. p_g,1 equals p_ew plus the fraction m_ew times g over A, which equals 1.4 bar underlined.
2. m_gas equals the fraction p_g,1 times V_g,1 over (R over mu) times T_g,1, which equals 3.4224 grams underlined.
