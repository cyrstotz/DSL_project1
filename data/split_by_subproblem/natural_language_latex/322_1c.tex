Entropy production: S_er dot

Entropy balance at the wall between the fluid and the refrigerant

Implies zero equals Q_zu dot divided by T_uKP minus Q_zu dot divided by T_Kaltmittel plus S_er dot

Implies S_er dot equals Q_zu dot divided by T_uKP minus Q_zu dot divided by T_Kaltmittel

Equals Q_zu dot times (1 divided by T_uKP minus 1 divided by T_Kaltmittel)

Equals 65 kilowatts times (1 divided by 295 Kelvin minus 1 divided by 373.15 Kelvin)

Equals 0.0461 kilowatts
