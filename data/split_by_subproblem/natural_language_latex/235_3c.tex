Continuing with the given values:

The mass m_g equals 3.6 grams, and the temperature T_{2,g} equals 0.003 degrees Celsius, which is 273.153 Kelvin.

The change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 is given by the equation:
Delta U_{12} equals the sum of heat Q minus the sum of work W_{v,n}.

The absolute value of heat Q_{12} is calculated as:
m_g times (u_2 minus u_1), which equals m_g times c_v times (T_2 minus T_1), resulting in 1139.4 Joules.
