The rate of heat error, denoted as Q dot subscript errz, is equal to the sum of the rate of heat out, denoted as Q dot subscript aus, and the rate of heat gas, denoted as Q dot subscript gas. This sum equals 65 kilowatts plus 65 kilowatts, which equals 373.15 kilowatts, and this implies 47.5 kilowatts.
