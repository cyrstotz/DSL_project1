The graph description is as follows: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled p in bars and the horizontal axis labeled T in Kelvin. There are two curves on the graph that intersect, forming a V-shape. The left curve begins from the top left and descends downwards, while the right curve begins from the top right and also descends downwards. A horizontal line connects two points on these curves, specifically point 2 on the left curve and point 7 on the right curve. This horizontal line is labeled as T_invert. Additionally, there is a wavy line that extends from point 7 to the right, indicating some form of oscillation or fluctuation.
