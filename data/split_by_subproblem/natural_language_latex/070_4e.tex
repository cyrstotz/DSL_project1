Q_ev at the capacitor:
Q equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times (h1 minus h2) plus Q dot minus W_t dot.

The internal heat transfer rate Q_ic dot equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times (h2 minus h1), which equals 0.7253 times 6.5, resulting in 725.3 Watts, from output c.

h2 equals h at 1.5 bar, x equals 0.2259, which is h_f plus x times (h_g minus h_f), resulting in 87.4684.

h2 equals 237.29 kilojoules per kilogram, from output b.

The temperature inside would continue to fall isochorically.
