The mass flow rate labeled m with subscripts 1, 2, 3, 4, followed by the phrase "Energy balance around compressor."

The equation zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between h sub c and h sub a minus the power input to the compressor, which implies that the mass flow rate equals the power input to the compressor divided by the difference between h sub c and h sub a.

Delta, followed by 243.78 equals h after the throttle.
