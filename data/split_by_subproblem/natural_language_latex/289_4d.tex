The efficiency epsilon sub K is equal to the absolute value of Q dot sub zu divided by the absolute value of W dot sub T.

Zero equals m dot times the difference of h sub 2 and h sub n2 plus Q sub K.

Q dot sub K equals m dot times the difference of h sub 2 and h sub n2, which implies zero.

h sub 2 at negative 22 degrees Celsius equals h sub g at 22 degrees Celsius, which is 21.77 kilojoules per kilogram.

h sub 2 from part c).

Zero equals m dot times the difference of h sub 1 and h sub 2 plus Q sub K.

Q dot sub K equals m dot times the difference of h sub 2 and h sub 1, which equals 0.26516 kilowatts.

Epsilon equals Q dot sub zu divided by W dot sub t, which equals 0.61825.
