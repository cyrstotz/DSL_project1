T [K]

P2 equals P3,
P1 equals P5 equals P4,
P0.

Description of the graph: The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as T[K] and the x-axis labeled as S [J/kg Â· K]. There are three curves on the graph, each representing different states. The first curve starts at point 0 and goes through points 1 and 6. The second curve starts at point 2 and goes through points 3 and 4.5. The third curve starts at point P0 and goes through points P1, P5, and P4. The points are connected with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
