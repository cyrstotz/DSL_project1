Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance plus the heat transfer rate times the reciprocal of the mass flow rate.

The heat transfer rate from state 1 to state 2 equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at entrance and the enthalpy at exit, where the enthalpy at entrance equals enthalpy at state 2, the enthalpy at exit equals enthalpy at state 1, enthalpy at state n equals enthalpy at state 3, and enthalpy at state g equals enthalpy at state 4.

x sub zero, the temperature T equals 40 degrees Celsius, the pressure at state 1 equals the pressure at state 4 equals 3.376 bar.

The pressure at state 2 equals the pressure at state 1.

The temperature at state 2 equals the temperature T minus 6 Kelvin, which equals 34 degrees Celsius.
