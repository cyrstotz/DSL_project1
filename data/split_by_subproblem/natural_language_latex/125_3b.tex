The pressure \( p_{3,1} \) equals 4.075 bar.

The same force equilibrium conditions as in part a) apply, but no mass flow has occurred, and the filling is temperature-independent.

Isolated cylinder:

The heat \( Q_1 \) equals \( Q_2 \).

The equation is as follows:
The mass of gas \( m_g \) times the specific heat at constant volume \( c_v \) times the initial temperature of the gas \( T_{g,1} \), plus the initial elastic potential energy \( KE_{s,1} \), plus the initial internal energy of the filling \( U_{F,s1} \), plus the difference in temperature \( T \) minus the initial elastic potential energy \( KE_{s,1} \) times the mass of the external world \( m_{EW} \) times the initial internal energy coefficient of the external world \( U_{K,s1} \), equals the final temperature of the gas \( T_{g,2} \) times the sum of the mass of gas \( m_g \) times the specific heat at constant volume \( c_v \) plus the final elastic potential energy \( KE_{s,2} \), minus the mass of the external world \( m_{EW} \) times the initial temperature of the external world \( T_{EW,1} \), minus the initial temperature of the external world \( T_{EW,1} \).
