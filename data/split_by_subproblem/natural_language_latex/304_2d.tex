Stationary flow process around the entire turbine:

Zero equals negative change in exergy E_ex,0 plus the sum of exergy flow rates E_ex,0 minus the sum of work rates W_i minus exergy flow rate E_ex,0. This implies that exergy e_ex,0 equals negative change in exergy e_ex,0 plus exergy e_va minus zero.

Exergy of the heat flow q_B:

Exergy flow rate E_ex,0 equals one minus the ratio of the reference temperature T_0 to the temperature T, all multiplied by the heat flow rate q. q_B equals q_B times the mass flow rate m.

This implies that mass m times exergy e_ex,0 equals one minus the ratio of the reference temperature T_0 to the temperature T, all multiplied by 49 Joules per kilogram times the mass flow rate m. This equals one minus the ratio of 302.273 Kelvin to 289 Kelvin, all multiplied by 49 Joules per kilogram times 1.195 kilograms per second, which equals 869.58 Joules per kilogram.

This implies that exergy e_ex,0 equals negative 108.745 plus 869.58, which equals 860.835 Joules per kilogram.
