Graph 1: The graph is a T-s diagram with the y-axis labeled as T and the x-axis labeled as s. The graph contains a cycle with six points labeled 1 through 6. The cycle starts at point 1, moves to point 2, then to point 3, and so on until it returns to point 1. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isentropic", the path from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "isentropic", and the path from point 4 to point 5 is labeled "isentropic". The path from point 5 to point 6 is labeled "isentropic". The path from point 6 to point 1 is labeled "isentropic". The region between points 1 and 2 is shaded.

Graph 2: The graph is a T-s diagram with the y-axis labeled as T and the x-axis labeled as s. The graph contains a cycle with six points labeled 1 through 6. The cycle starts at point 1, moves to point 2, then to point 3, and so on until it returns to point 1. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isentropic", the path from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isobaric", the path from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "adiabatic", the path from point 4 to point 5 is labeled "isobaric", and the path from point 5 to point 6 is labeled "isentropic". The region between points 1 and 2 is shaded.
