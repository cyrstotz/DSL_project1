In the center, there is a picture of size 100 by 100. The picture includes:
- A horizontal vector from the origin to the right spanning 100 units.
- A vertical vector from the origin upwards spanning 100 units.
- Multiple lines starting from the origin (0,0) with different slopes and lengths. Each line starts at the origin, extends to a certain point, then continues horizontally for 20 units, and then extends further maintaining the initial slope to a new point, followed by another horizontal line of 20 units. This pattern is repeated for slopes of 1:1 up to 1:14, with each slope increasing by 1 for each new line.

The equation provided is:
Zero equals the total mass times the change in position plus the sum of Z minus W minus the average energy loss.

The average energy loss is equal to the total mass times the change in position minus W.
