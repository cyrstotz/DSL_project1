The equation pV equals nRT implies m equals pV divided by RT. This leads to V equals 0.00314 cubic meters. The gas constant R is calculated as R divided by m, which equals 8.314 kilojoules per (Kelvin times mole) divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole, resulting in 0.16628 kilojoules per (kilogram times Kelvin). Consequently, m_2 equals 0.3405 grams.
