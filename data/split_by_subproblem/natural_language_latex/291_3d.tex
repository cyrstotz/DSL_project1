The absolute value of Q_12 is 1500 Joules, and it is supplied.

The change in energy, Delta E, equals E_2 minus E_1, which equals the mass of the equilibrium multiplied by the molecular equivalent weight times (u_2 minus u_1), and this equals zero because Q_12 minus W is canceled, indicating that the equilibrium does not expand.

u_12, where u_2 minus u_1 equals Q_12 divided by the mass of the equilibrium, which equals 1.5 kilojoules divided by 0.1 kilograms, resulting in 15 kilojoules per kilogram.

At 0 degrees Celsius, u_2, where x_es1 equals 0.6, and P_es1 equals (M times k times g divided by A) plus P_ambient, which equals g divided by D squared times (m times k divided by 4) plus P_ambient.

u_fes plus 13.997 equals negative 333.224 plus 333.812, and the calculation (13.997 minus 10 divided by 20 minus 10 minus 333.812) results in 13.997 Pascals, which equals 3.997 bar.

u_fes3 equals negative 333.224 minus 333.812, as per Table 1.

u_fes equals negative 333.97 kilojoules per kilogram.

u_fes13.997 equals negative 0.663 minus 0.322, and the calculation (13.997 minus 10 divided by 20 minus 10 minus 0.322) results in negative 0.450 kilojoules per kilogram.

u_1 equals u_f plus x times (u_fg minus u_f), which equals negative 16.721 kilojoules per kilogram.

u_2 equals u_1 plus 15 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in u_2 equals negative 1.721 kilojoules per kilogram.

u_2 equals negative 152.2 kilojoules per kilogram.

u_2 equals u_4L plus x_2 times (u_4E minus u_4L).

The fraction (u_2 minus u_4L) divided by (u_4E minus u_4L) equals x_2eis, which equals (negative 152.2 minus 0.450) divided by (negative 333.97 minus 0.450), resulting in 0.455 equals x_2eis.
