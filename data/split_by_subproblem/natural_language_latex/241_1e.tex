s1 equals s1 evaluated at x equals 0.005 and 100 degrees Celsius, which equals sf at 100 degrees Celsius plus x times the difference between sg at 100 degrees Celsius and sf at 100 degrees Celsius. Refer to Table A-2. A1 equals 1.33714 kilograms per kilogram Kelvin.

s2 equals s2 evaluated at x equals 0.70 degrees Celsius, which equals 0.9548 kilograms per kilogram Kelvin.

Delta s12 equals m2 times s2 minus m1 prime times s1. This equals the sum of Delta m12 and m1 times s2 minus m1 prime times s1, which equals 13947.198 kilograms per Kelvin.
