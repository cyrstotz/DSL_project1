c) State 2 equilibrium, implies that the change in internal energy, Delta U, equals zero.

The change in internal energy is the sum of the change in internal energy of the gas and the change in internal energy of the environment:
Delta U equals Delta U_gas plus Delta U_EW.

The specific heat at constant volume times the temperature change of the gas, cv times (T_2g minus T_1g), and the specific heat of the interface times the temperature change of the water, c_if times (T_2w minus T_1w).

The temperatures T_2g and T_2w both equal 0.003 degrees Celsius.

The change in energy, Delta E, equals the heat added, Q, minus the work done by the system, W_v, which equals zero.

This implies that Q equals W_v, leading to q equals omega_v equals R times (T_2 minus T_1) divided by (1 minus n).

The gas constant, R, equals the specific heat at constant volume times (k minus 1).

The ratio of the gas constant to the specific heat at constant volume plus 1 equals k.

For the same system:
The mass times the change in specific internal energy, m times (u_2 minus u_1), equals Q.

The specific heat at constant volume times the temperature change, cv times (T_2 minus T_1).
