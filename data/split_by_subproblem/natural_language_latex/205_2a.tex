The graph description includes a plot with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph features two curves, each marked with arrows to show the direction of the process. The first curve begins at point 1, progresses to point 2, then to point 3, and concludes at point 4. The second curve starts at point 5 and ends at point 6. The points on the curves are connected by lines and are labeled in a sequential order. Additionally, there are pressure annotations at points 4 and 6, indicating pressures of 0.5 bar at point 4 and 0.15 bar at point 6.
