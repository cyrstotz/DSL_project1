d) The internal energy change from state 1 to state 2, denoted as U_12, is equal to the heat added, Q_12, minus the work done, W_12.

The following equations are presented:

1. The mass of the working fluid times the change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 plus the heat added from state 1 to state 2.

2. The internal energy at a fraction x equals 0.6 is given by the internal energy at state 1 plus 0.6 times the difference in internal energy between state 2 and state 1, which equals negative 200.092 kilojoules per kilogram.

3. The internal energy at state 2 is approximately 0.6 times the ratio of the internal energy at state 2 to the internal energy at state 1, multiplied by the mass of the working fluid.

4. The internal energy at state 2 is equal to the internal energy at state 1 plus the heat added from state 1 to state 2 divided by the mass of the working fluid, which equals negative 188.921 kilojoules per kilogram.

The value of x is approximately 0.559, calculated as the ratio of the difference between the internal energy at state 2 and the internal energy at state 1 at 1.4 bar, to the difference in internal energies at 1.4 bar between state 2 and state 1.
