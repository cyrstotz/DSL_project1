The problem b consists of the following equations and values:

1. The speed \( w_s \) is 220 meters per second.
2. The pressure \( p_s \) is 0.5 bar.
3. The temperature \( T_s \) is 431.9 Kelvin.

In the section titled "Stat. Fluorper", the equations are:

1. \( 0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_s - h_1 + \frac{w_s^2 - w_1^2}{2} \right] + 0 - \dot{W}_t \), where the term involving heat transfer \( \dot{Q} \) is crossed out and equals zero.

2. The change in enthalpy \( h_s - h_1 \) is equal to \( C_p \) times the change in temperature \( T_s - T_1 \).

3. The reversible work \( \dot{W}_t^{rev} \) is equal to the negative of \( \dot{m} \) times the sum of the integral from state 1 to state s of \( v \, dp \) plus the change in kinetic energy \( \Delta ke \).

4. The equation \( pv = RT \) relates pressure, specific volume, and temperature, where \( v \) is the specific volume which can be expressed as \( \frac{RT}{p} \).

5. The work \( \dot{W}_t \) is equal to the negative of \( \dot{m} \) times \( RT \).
