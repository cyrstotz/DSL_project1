Section 3c) Transferred Heat Amount:

- Energy Balance: Closed System:
  The change in energy, Delta E, equals Q12 minus W_rev,12.

- 1:
  The reversible work, W_rev,12, is the integral from V1 to V2 of the external pressure times dV, which equals the external pressure times (V2 minus V1).
  Assuming T2, V2 equals 0.003 degrees Celsius,
  pV equals mRT,
  V2 equals m g R_g T2 divided by the external pressure,
  which equals 1.11 liters or 0.0011 cubic meters,
  which equals -223.41 Joules.

- 2:
  The change in energy, Delta E, equals m times (u2 minus u1), which equals m times C_V times (T2 minus T1),
  which equals 0.00269 times (6.833 times (273.15 minus 773.15)),
  which equals -851.38 Joules.

- 3:
  Q12 equals -1074.79 Joules.
