Creation: closed system, ideal gas.

The change in energy is equal to the change in internal energy, which is the heat added minus the work done by the surroundings:
Delta E equals Delta U equals delta Q minus delta W subscript 'um'.

The absolute value of heat released is equal to the absolute value of the change in internal energy plus the work done:
absolute value of Q subscript 'ab' equals absolute value of U_2 minus U_1 plus W subscript 'u'.

The change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 is given by the specific heat at constant volume times the temperature change, which calculates to:
U_2 minus U_1 equals C_v times (T_2 minus T_1) equals 0.693 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (0 minus (500 plus 273.15) Kelvin) equals negative 489.4 kilojoules per kilogram.

The work done is calculated by integrating the pressure over the change in specific volume minus the pressure times the change in volume, which results in:
W subscript 'u' equals integral from 1 to 2 of p dV subscript 'u' minus p times (V_2 minus V_1) equals R_0 times (T_2 minus T_1) equals 0.1663 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times negative 573.15 Kelvin equals negative 95.575 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, the absolute value of heat transferred in the process is:
implies absolute value of Q subscript 'u' equals 67.97 kilojoules per kilogram.
The absolute value of Q subscript 'u' equals absolute value of Q subscript 'u' equals mass times absolute value of q subscript 'u' equals 0.003924 kilograms times 67.97 kilojoules per kilogram equals 2.135 kilojoules equals absolute value of Q subscript 'u'.
