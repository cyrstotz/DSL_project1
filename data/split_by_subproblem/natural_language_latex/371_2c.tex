The mass flow rate, denoted as m-dot, is 520 kilograms per hour and the initial temperature T-zero is 340 Kelvin. The change in specific exergy due to entropy production, denoted as Delta e-ex-sr, is equal to the enthalpy at the exit minus the enthalpy at the entrance minus the product of the initial temperature and the difference in entropy between the exit and the entrance, plus the change in specific exergy, Delta e.
