- The graph is a pressure versus temperature diagram.
- The y-axis is labeled pressure (p) and the x-axis is labeled temperature (T).
- There are three regions labeled "Solid", "Liquid", and "Gas".
- The curve starts from the origin and curves upwards, separating the "Solid" and "Gas" regions.
- A horizontal line extends from the curve into the "Liquid" region, labeled "not yet frozen".
- A vertical line from the end of the horizontal line intersects the curve again, labeled "End".
- The point where the horizontal line starts is labeled "T".
- The point where the curve starts is labeled "frozen".
