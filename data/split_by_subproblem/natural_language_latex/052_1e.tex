The change in entropy, Delta S, equals S2 minus S1, which equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference in entropy s2 minus s1. This is further equal to the heat transfer rate, Q dot, divided by the temperature T, minus the heat loss rate, Q dot loss, divided by the ambient temperature T0, plus the generated entropy S_erz.

This implies that the change in entropy from state 1 to state 2, Delta S_12, equals the generated entropy S_erz.
