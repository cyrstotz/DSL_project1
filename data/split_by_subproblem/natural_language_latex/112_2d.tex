The expression for \( e_{x,vel} \) is given by \( T_{0} \) times the difference \( (s_{6} - s_{0}) \), which equals the crossed out term \( \dot{m}_{in} \) times the sum of \( T_{0} (s_{6} - s_{0}) \) and half the difference of \( w_{2}^{2} \) minus \( w_{0}^{2} \).

The heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{B,5A} \) is the ratio of \( \dot{Q}_{B} \) to \( \dot{m}_{in} \), which is equal to the ratio of \( \dot{Q}_{B} \) to \( \dot{m}_{ges} \), and this ratio is 6.233. Therefore, \( \dot{Q}_{B} \) divided by \( \dot{m}_{ges} \) equals 6.233 times \( \dot{Q}_{B} \), and \( \dot{Q}_{B} \) equals \( \dot{Q}_{B,5A} \).

The expression for \( e_{x,vel} \) is then updated to \( T_{0} (s_{6} - s_{0}) \) minus the crossed out term \( \dot{m}_{in} \) times half the difference of \( w_{2}^{2} \) minus \( w_{0}^{2} \).

The difference \( s_{6} - s_{0} \) is equal to \( c_{p} \) times the natural logarithm of the ratio \( \frac{T_{6}}{T_{0}} \).
