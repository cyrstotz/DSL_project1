b) reversible and adiabatic thrust nozzle:

Energy balance around the thrust nozzle:
Zero equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at entrance plus half the difference of the square of velocity at exit and the square of velocity at entrance).

Entropy balance:
Zero equals mass flow rate times (entropy at exit minus entropy at entrance), which implies entropy at exit equals entropy at entrance.

For ideal polytropic state behavior:
Temperature at state 6 equals temperature at state s times (pressure at state 6 over pressure at state s) raised to the power of (n minus 1 over n).
328.07 Kelvin equals temperature at state 6.

From equation I:
Twice (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 5) equals half the difference of the square of velocity at state 5 and the square of velocity at state 6.

Square of velocity at state 6 equals square of velocity at state 5 minus twice (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 5).

Thus, velocity at state 6 equals the square root of (square of velocity at state 5 minus twice (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 5)).

Velocity at state 6 equals the square root of 507.24 kilojoules per kilogram.

Cp: (Temperature at state 6 minus Temperature at state 5)

In units of kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin equals 104.44 kilojoules per kilogram.
