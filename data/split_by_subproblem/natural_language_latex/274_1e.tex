The change in entropy, denoted as Delta S12, is given by the formula:

Delta S equals the mass at state 2 minus the mass at state 1 minus the sum of the change in mass times entropy at each state plus the sum of the heat transfer rate over temperature plus the generated entropy.

Another expression for Delta S is given by the mass flow rate times the difference in entropy between state 2 and state 1.

The values from Table A2 are:
Entropy at state 2, S2, equals 0.9544.
Entropy at state 1, S1, equals 1.3069.
