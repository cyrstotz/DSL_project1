1. Energy balance equation: mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entry plus heat transfer rate minus work rate equals zero.

2. The efficiency epsilon k is equal to the ratio of the incoming heat transfer rate to the difference between the outgoing heat transfer rate and the incoming heat transfer rate.

3. The incoming heat transfer rate is equal to the cooling capacity, which is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at entry and the enthalpy at exit.

4. This is equal to the mass flow rate times the enthalpy at a temperature of negative 16 degrees Celsius, which for a mass flow rate of 4 kilograms per hour and the specific enthalpy at negative 16 degrees Celsius equals 833.8.
