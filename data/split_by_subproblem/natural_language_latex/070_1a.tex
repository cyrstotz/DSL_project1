The question asks for "Q_aus" in a steady-state flow process in a reactor.

The equation given is:
Zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy in and the enthalpy q, plus the heat flow rate R, minus the work flow rate f, minus the heat flow rate out.

The heat flow rate out is expressed as:
The heat flow rate out equals the mass flow rate in times the difference between the enthalpy in and the enthalpy q, plus the heat flow rate R, which equals 62.182 kilowatts.

From Table A-2:
The enthalpy e equals the enthalpy f at 700 degrees Celsius, which is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy q equals the enthalpy f at 1000 degrees Celsius, which is 419.09 kilojoules per kilogram.
