The equations provided are as follows:

1. The rate of energy loss, denoted as \( \dot{E}_{x, \text{verl}} \), is equal to the initial temperature \( T_0 \) multiplied by the rate of entropy destruction \( \dot{S}_{\text{zerst}} \).

2. The rate of entropy destruction \( \dot{S}_{\text{zerst}} \) is equal to the sum of the rate of entropy increase in the condenser \( \dot{S}_{\text{verd}} \), the rate of entropy increase in the combustion chamber \( \dot{S}_{\text{brennkammer}} \), and the rate of entropy increase in the turbine \( \dot{S}_{\text{turbine}} \).

3. The rate of entropy input \( \dot{S}_{\text{im}} \) is equal to the total mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \) multiplied by the difference in entropy between states 2 and 0, plus the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) multiplied by the difference in entropy between states 4 and 3, plus the rate of heat transfer \( \dot{q} \) divided by the initial temperature \( T_0 \).

4. The equation for the rate of entropy destruction \( \dot{S}_{\text{zerst}} \) starts with the difference in entropy between states 1 and \( s \) (the equation is incomplete and cuts off here).
