W sub six squared, T sub six cubed, p sub zero equals 0.191 bar.

Zero equals the total mass flow rate times the quantity h sub five minus h sub six plus one half m w sub six squared plus one half m w sub five squared.

The total mass flow rate approaches zero, equals the total mass flow rate times the matrix:
- h sub five equals h of 437.9 Kelvin, 0.5 bar equals A minus 22, B equals 490,
- C equals 437.9 times 10 to the power of 3, D equals 491.6 times 10 to the power of 3,
- A equals 490, B equals 490, C equals 437.9 times 10 to the power of 3, D equals 491.6 times 10 to the power of 3,
- h sub six equals h of 0.491.
