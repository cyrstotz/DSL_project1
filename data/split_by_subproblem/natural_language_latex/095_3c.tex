There is a rectangular box drawn with a horizontal arrow pointing to the right labeled \( \dot{Q}_{12} \) inside the box.

Overall system on piston:

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is equal to \( \dot{Q}_{12} \) minus \( \dot{W}_{12} \).

The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference in internal energy between state 2 and state 1 \( (u_2 - u_1) \) is equal to \( \dot{Q}_{12} \) minus the integral of pressure \( p \) with respect to volume \( dV \).
