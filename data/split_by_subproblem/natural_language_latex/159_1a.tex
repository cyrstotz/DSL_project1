Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry minus the heat flow rate out. The heat flow rate out equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry, which equals negative 37.953 kilowatts. The mass flow rate is 0.3 kilograms per second. The enthalpy at exit for fluid at 90 degrees Celsius is 232.99 kilojoules per kilogram. The enthalpy at entry for fluid at 100 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.
