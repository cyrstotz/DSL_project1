The equations and expressions from the LaTeX content translate to natural language as follows:

1. The product of pressure (p) and volume (V) is constant. The equivalent weight (EW) is calculated as 1 bar plus 32.5 grams per square centimeter, which equals 7 plus 0.4 bar, resulting in 1.4 bar.

2. The change in energy (Delta E) is equal to the sum of heat (Q) minus the sum of work (W).

3. The product of mass (m) and the difference in internal energy (u2 minus u1) equals the heat transfer (Q12).

4. The internal energy at state 2 (u2) is equal to the internal energy at state 1 (u1) plus x times the difference between the internal energy at saturated vapor (ug) and the internal energy at saturated liquid (uf), which equals negative 200.09 kilojoules per kilogram.

5. The internal energy at state 2 (u2) is equal to the heat (Q) divided by the mass (m) minus the internal energy at state 1 (u1).

6. The internal energy at state 2 (u2) equals negative 200.39 grams.

7. The internal energy at state 2 (u2) is calculated as negative 200.398 plus 333.458 divided by negative 0.045 plus 3.33458, resulting in 0.40.

8. There is a 40 percent change (Delta 40%).
