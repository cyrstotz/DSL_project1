The graph description states that the graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as the sum of kilojoules per kilogram and the y-axis labeled as temperature in Kelvin. The graph features a curve that begins at the origin, ascends to a peak, and then descends. A horizontal line intersects this curve at two points. Moreover, there is a tangent line at the second intersection point, which is labeled as "Isoline".
