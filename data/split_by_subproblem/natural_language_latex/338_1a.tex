The total heat output, denoted as Q dot subscript "aus", is equal to the mass flow rate entering, denoted as m dot subscript "ein".

The total heat output, Q dot subscript "aus", is indicated by an arrow pointing from the mass flow rate exiting, m dot subscript "aus".

The heat rejection, Q subscript R, is 100 kilowatts.

The equation O equals the product of the mass flow rate, m dot, and the difference in enthalpy between entering and exiting, h subscript "ein" minus h subscript "aus", plus Q.

The enthalpy at entering conditions, h subscript "ein", is at 70 degrees Celsius.

The difference in enthalpy between entering and exiting, h subscript "ein" minus h subscript "aus", is equal to the product of the specific heat at constant pressure, c subscript if, and the temperature difference between entering and exiting, T subscript "ein" minus T subscript "aus", plus the product of the specific volume at constant pressure, v subscript if, and the pressure difference between entering and exiting, p subscript "ein" minus p subscript "aus".

The difference in enthalpy between entering and exiting, h subscript "ein" minus h subscript "aus", is calculated specifically as the product of the specific heat at constant pressure, c subscript if, and the temperature difference from 288.15 Kelvin to 293.15 Kelvin.
