The final entropy for KF, denoted as \( s_{f}^{\text{KF}} \), is given by the integral from \( s_{0} \) to \( s_{e} \) of \( \frac{T \, ds}{s} \).

The final entropy for KF, \( s_{f}^{\text{KF}} \), is also expressed as the difference between the final enthalpy for KF, \( h_{f}^{\text{KF}} \), and the initial enthalpy for KF, \( h_{\text{ein}}^{\text{KF}} \), divided by the initial temperature for KF, \( T_{\text{ein}}^{\text{KF}} \). This expression is then multiplied by the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final temperature for KF, \( T_{\text{aus}}^{\text{KF}} \), to the initial temperature for KF, \( T_{\text{ein}}^{\text{KF}} \).

The result is boxed and equals \( 293.122 \, \text{K} \).
