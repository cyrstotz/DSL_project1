b) The equation p times V equals m times R times T implies T.

The equilibrium mixture consists of ice and water, therefore the mixed temperature, T_misch, is 0 degrees Celsius.

No more heat exchange takes place.

Therefore, the final temperature, T_gz, is 0 degrees Celsius, which is 273.15 Kelvin.

The final pressure, p_gz, equals the initial pressure, p_1,g, since the ambient pressure, p_amb, remains constant.

And the mass of the weight and the equilibrium mixture remain constant, therefore the final pressure, p_gz, is 1.407 bar.
