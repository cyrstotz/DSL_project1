The change in energy, Delta E, is equal to Q minus the rate of work done, W dot.

Negative total mass times internal energy at state 1 plus the sum of total mass and mass change times internal energy at state 2 equals the heat output for process 12.

Total mass times the difference in internal energy between state 2 and state 1 plus the mass change times internal energy at state 2 equals the heat output for process 12.

The mass change, Delta m12, is equal to the sum of heat output plus total mass times the difference in internal energy between state 1 and state 2, all divided by the internal energy at state 2, which equals 2793.5971 kilograms.

Internal energy at state 1, U1, is equal to x0 times the internal energy of gas plus (1 minus x0) times the internal energy of fluid, from table A-2.

This equals 428.3778 kilojoules per kilogram.

Internal energy at state 2, U2, is 282.55 kilojoules per kilogram, from table A-2.

The boiling fraction, xsieden, is zero.
