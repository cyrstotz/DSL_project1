The average temperature T-bar is given by the formula T-bar equals the integral of T ds divided by the difference s-a minus s-e. With no change in pressure, the integral of T ds equals q-rev.

T-bar equals q-rev divided by s-a minus s-e equals c-p times T-2 minus T-1 divided by c-p times the natural logarithm of T-2 over T-1 equals T-2 minus T-1 divided by the natural logarithm of T-2 over T-1 equals 288.15 minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of 288.15 over 288.15.

T-bar equals 293.12 Kelvin.
