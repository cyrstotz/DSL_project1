In equilibrium, the shape is U-shaped.

The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is A equals pi times r squared, which equals 7.85 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.

r equals d divided by 2.

p equals F divided by A.

The pressure at state 1, p_S1, equals p_0 plus (m_Kolben times g divided by A) plus (m_Eis times g divided by A), which equals 1.46 bar.

Perfect gas!

p times V equals m times R times T.

The mass at state 1, m_S1, equals (p_S1 times V_S1) divided by (R times T), which equals 3.425.

R equals R bar divided by M, which equals 166.28 Joules per kilogram per Kelvin.

550 kilograms per mole equals 50 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms per mole.
