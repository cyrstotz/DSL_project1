Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and at entrance plus the mass flow rate times e plus g times the difference in elevation from exit to entrance plus the heat transfer rate minus the sum of the input work rates. This equals the mass flow rate for component K times the difference between enthalpy at state 1 and state 2 plus the negative of the heat transfer rate leaving plus Q_k plus 28 watts. Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 1 and state 2 plus Q_k. Q_k equals the mass flow rate for component K times the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and state 1.

Zero equals the mass flow rate for component K times the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and state 3 plus Q_k plus 28 watts. This equals the mass flow rate times the integral from temperature T1 to T2 of the specific heat at constant pressure times the temperature differential plus velocity times the difference in pressure from state 2 to state 1 plus the heat transfer rate for component K plus 28 watts.

h_2 equals saturated steam.
