The content describes a table with seven columns and five rows including the header row. The columns are labeled as follows: an unnamed column, pressure in bar denoted as \( p[\text{bar}] \), temperature in Kelvin denoted as \( T[K] \), specific enthalpy denoted as \( h\left(\frac{kJ}{kg}\right) \), heat or work flow rate denoted as \( \dot{Q}/\dot{W}\left(\frac{kJ}{kg}\right) \), quality denoted as \( x \), and a column for notes.

The rows contain the following data:
- The first row is the header.
- The second row, labeled '1', has data only in the heat or work flow rate column, denoted as \( Q_k \).
- The third row, labeled '2', has an empty cell for pressure, temperature, and specific enthalpy, a work flow rate of 28W denoted as \( \dot{W} = 28W \), a quality of 1, and the note 'adiabatic reversible'.
- The fourth row, labeled '3', has a pressure of 8 bar, and the heat flow rate denoted as \( Q_{abs} \), with other cells empty.
- The fifth row, labeled '4', has a pressure of 8 bar, a quality of 0, with other cells empty.
