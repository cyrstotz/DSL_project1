Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry plus the heat output.

The heat output equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at condition c and the enthalpy at entry.

The difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry equals the specific heat at constant volume times the difference between temperature two and temperature one.

The enthalpy at temperature 700 equals 2626.9.

The mass flow rate at exit equals 0.3 times the mass flow rate at output.

The temperature at entry one is 373.15 Kelvin.

The temperature at output is 373.75 Kelvin.

The total mass is 5.755 kilograms.

The reference temperature at entry is 298.15 Kelvin.

The reference temperature at output is 298.75 Kelvin.
