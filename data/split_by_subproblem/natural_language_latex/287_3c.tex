c) Energy balance:

The change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 is given by the equation:
U2 minus U1 equals Q dot minus W dot.

Further, the change in internal energy can be calculated as:
U2 minus U1 equals the mass of gas times the specific heat at constant volume times the change in temperature of the gas, which equals 3.19 times 6.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (0 minus 500 degrees Celsius), resulting in minus 10.76 Joules.

The work done is given by:
W dot equals the integral of pressure times the change in volume, which equals pressure times the change in volume, equals the mass of gas times the gas pressure times the change in volume, equals 3.19 times 1.4 bar times 0.00201 cubic meters, resulting in minus 0.00201 cubic meters.

The volume at state 2 is calculated as:
V2 equals the mass times the gas constant divided by pressure times the temperature at state 2, equals 3.19 times 8.314 divided by 1.4 bar, resulting in 0.00201 cubic meters.

The work done is also calculated as:
W dot equals minus 0.961078 Joules.

- The heat transfer Q dot is calculated as:
Q dot equals U dot from state 1 to state 2 minus W dot, equals minus 1076.36 Joules.
