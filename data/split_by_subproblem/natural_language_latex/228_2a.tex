A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled T in Kelvin and the horizontal axis labeled S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph contains a closed loop with six points labeled from (1) to (6). The path from point (1) to point (2) is a vertical line going upwards. The path from point (2) to point (3) is a curved line going upwards and to the right, labeled "isobaric". The path from point (3) to point (4) is a vertical line going downwards. The path from point (4) to point (5) is a curved line going downwards and to the right, labeled "isobaric". The path from point (5) to point (6) is a curved line going downwards and to the left, labeled "isothermal". The path from point (6) to point (1) is a curved line going upwards and to the left, labeled "isothermal".
