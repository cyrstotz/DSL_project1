The mass flow rate, denoted by m-dot, equals the heat flow rate, denoted by Q-dot, divided by h. The temperature T1 is negative 22 degrees Celsius, based on assumptions.

The pressure p02 is 1.292 bar, as referenced from Table A-10, and the pressure p2 equals the pressure p4.

From the energy balance for a throttle: zero equals m-dot times (h4 minus h1), which implies that h2 equals h4.

The enthalpy h4 is 93.62 kilojoules per kilogram, which is equal to h1, and the enthalpy h2 is 234.08 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced from Table A-10.

The quality x is calculated as (h4 minus hf) divided by (hg minus hf), which equals (93.62 minus 0) divided by (234.08 minus 0), resulting in 0.337.
