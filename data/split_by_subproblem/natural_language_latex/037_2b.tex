T naught equals negative 30 degrees Celsius, which is equal to 243.15 Kelvin.

p naught times V naught equals R times T naught implies V naught equals R times T naught divided by p naught.

R equals c sub p minus c sub v, which equals c sub p minus c sub p divided by k, equals 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

V naught equals 3.65908 cubic meters per kilogram.

T six over T naught equals (V six over V naught) raised to the power of k minus 1 implies T six over T naught equals (R times T six over p naught times V naught) raised to the power of k minus 1.

p naught times V six equals R times T six implies V six equals R times T six divided by p naught.

T naught equals (R over p naught times V naught) raised to the power of k minus 1 times T six raised to the power of k minus 1 equals (R over p naught times V naught) raised to the power of k minus 1 times T six raised to the power of k.

T six over T five equals (p six over p five) raised to the power of (k minus 1) over k implies T six equals T five times (p six over p five) raised to the power of (k minus 1) over k equals 328.0747 Kelvin.

S five equals S six.

Zero equals m dot ges times [h five minus h six plus (v five squared minus v six squared) over 2] minus W dot turbine.
