- The process from 5 to 6 is adiabatic and reversible, which implies it is isentropic.

The table contains the following columns and entries:
- Column headers are P, T, W.
- Row entries are:
  - Row 0: P = 0, T = 0.131, W = 293.15
  - Row 5: P = 0.5, T = 431.9, W = 220
  - Row 6: P = 0.131, T and W are not provided.
- Rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 are present but do not contain any data.

The efficiency \(\eta_{1,5}\) is less than 1.
