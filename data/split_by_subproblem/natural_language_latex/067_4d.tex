Item d) The equation epsilon sub k equals the ratio of Q sub zu over W sub k, which equals the ratio of 146.42 watts over 28 watts, resulting in 5.23.

Item EB (Flow process): The equation zero equals m dot times the difference h sub 2 minus h sub 1 plus Q sub mu. This implies that Q sub mu equals m dot times the difference h sub 2 minus h sub 1, which equals 146.42 watts.
