Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance, plus the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature, plus the entropy generation rate. The negative entropy generation rate equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the sum of 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and 1.308 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, plus 62.18 kilowatts divided by 293.12 Kelvin. This implies that the entropy generation rate is 0.1 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The difference between the exergy entropy and the initial entropy equals the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance, which is equal to the specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the entrance temperature to the ambient temperature. The entropy at the exit is 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the entropy at the entrance is 1.308 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
