The change in entropy for x2, denoted as Delta S_x2, equals m2 times S2 minus m1 times S1, which equals the change in mass for x2 times the entropy at 70 degrees Celsius for saturated steam, plus some crossed out text, resulting in 64.85 megajoules per Kelvin.

The mass m1 equals the total mass, which is 57.55 kilograms.

The mass m2 equals the change in mass for x2 plus the total mass, resulting in 63.55 kilograms.

The entropy S1 equals the entropy at 100 degrees Celsius for saturated liquid plus x_p times the difference between the entropy at 100 degrees Celsius for saturated steam and saturated liquid, resulting in 1.33 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

From Table A2, the entropy for saturated liquid at 100 degrees Celsius is 1.3064 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy for saturated steam at 100 degrees Celsius is 7.354 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy S2 equals the entropy at 70 degrees Celsius for saturated steam, which is 7.7553 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
