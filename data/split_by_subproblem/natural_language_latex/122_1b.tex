The average temperature, denoted as T-bar, is given by the formula:
T-bar equals the integral from s_e to s_a of T ds, all over s_a minus s_e.

The difference s_a minus s_e is calculated as the integral from T_1 to T_2 of cif(T) over T dT, which equals 0.73376 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

This can be rewritten as cif times the natural logarithm of T_2 over T_1.

Here, cif equals the mass flow rate dot m times the change in time Delta t, which equals 21.66 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Finally, the average temperature T-bar is calculated as the integral from s_e to s_a of T ds over s_a minus s_e, times the fraction (T_2 minus T_1) over (s_a minus s_e), plus T_1, resulting in 254.514 Kelvin.
