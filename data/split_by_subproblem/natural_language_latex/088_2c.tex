The change in entropy from state 1 to state 6, denoted as Delta s from 1 to 6, equals the mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, times the expression in parentheses. The expression inside the parentheses is h naught minus h six minus T naught times the difference between s six and s naught plus half of v six squared.
