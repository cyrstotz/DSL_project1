- Stationary 1HS around blade tube:
  Zero equals mass flow rate times the difference of enthalpy at point 5 and point 6 plus half the difference of the square of the velocity at point 5 and the square of the velocity at point 6.

- Reversible adiabatic blade tube:
  The ratio of temperature at point 6 to temperature at point 5 equals the ratio of pressure at point 6 to pressure at point 5 raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.

- n equals 1.4.

- The difference in enthalpy between point 5 and point 6 equals specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between point 5 and point 6, which equals 1.006 times (431.5 minus 320), resulting in 104 kilojoules per kilogram.

- Temperature at point 6 equals temperature at point 5 times the ratio of pressure at point 6 to pressure at point 5 raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n, resulting in 320 Kelvin.

- The heat transfer rate is equal to the mass flow rate times the sum of the difference in enthalpy between point 0 and point 6, minus the product of the temperature at point 0 and the difference in entropy between point 0 and point 6, plus the change in kinetic energy.

- The difference in enthalpy between point 0 and point 6 equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between point 0 and point 6, resulting in 85.36 kilojoules per kilogram.

- The difference in entropy between point 6 and point 6 equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature at point 0 to temperature at point 6 minus the gas constant times the natural logarithm of the ratio of pressure at point 0 to pressure at point 6, resulting in -0.3 minus 286.99 times the ratio of pressure at point 0 to pressure at point 6.

- The gas constant R equals the universal gas constant divided by the molar mass, resulting in 286.99.

- The change in kinetic energy equals half the difference of the square of 200 and the square of 481.67.

- The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the sum of 85.36 minus 243.25 times -0.3 minus the change in kinetic energy.
