Water with initial velocity \( w_0 \) equals 510 meters per second, and \( T_L \) equals 310 Kelvin. The change in specific exergy due to the stream \( \Delta e_{x,\text{str}} \) is given by the expression \( h_L - h_0 - T_0 (s_L - s_0) + ke_c \). Breaking it down, the change in enthalpy \( h_L - h_0 \) is equal to \( c_p \) times the difference \( T_L - T_0 \). The change in entropy \( s_L - s_0 \) is equal to \( c_p \) times the natural logarithm of the ratio \( \frac{T_L}{T_0} \) plus \( k \) times the natural logarithm of the ratio \( \frac{p_0}{p_0} \), noting that the pressure remains constant, \( p_0 = p_0 \). The kinetic energy term \( ke_c \) is equal to one half of \( w_0 \) squared. Given \( T_0 \) equals negative 30 degrees Celsius, which is 243.15 Kelvin, the change in specific exergy \( \Delta e_{x,\text{str}} \) simplifies to \( c_p \) times \( T_L - T_0 \) minus \( T_0 \) times the natural logarithm of \( \frac{T_L}{T_0} \) plus one half of \( w_0 \) squared. The final result is boxed and equals 13.084 kilojoules per kilogram.
