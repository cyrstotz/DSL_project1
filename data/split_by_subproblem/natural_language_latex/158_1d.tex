From the heat transfer rate, denoted as Q dot, equals the change in mass from state 1 to 2. The temperature T is 70 degrees Celsius, which is equivalent to 343.15 Kelvin. The change in energy, Delta E, equals Q minus the work done, W, where the work done is zero. 

35 megajoules equals the mass m times the difference in specific internal energy between state 2 and state 1. Converting to joules, 35,000,000 joules equals the mass m times (418.5 kilojoules per kilogram minus 83.55 kilojoules per kilogram). This equation is repeated multiple times, each time stating that 35,000,000 joules equals the mass m times (418.5 kilojoules per kilogram minus 83.55 kilojoules per kilogram).
