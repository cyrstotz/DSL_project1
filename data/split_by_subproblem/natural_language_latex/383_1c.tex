Entropy Balance:

The equation is zero equals m dot times the difference of s_in and s_aus, plus Q dot R divided by T_Trenn,1, minus Q dot aw divided by T_KF, plus S dot erz.

This implies that S dot erz equals Q dot aw divided by T_KF plus m dot times the difference of s_in and s_aus,ein, minus Q dot R divided by T_Trenn,1.

s_aus equals s_f plus X_D times the difference of s_g and s_f, which equals 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin plus 0.005 times the difference of 7.3589 and 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, resulting in 1.3374 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
