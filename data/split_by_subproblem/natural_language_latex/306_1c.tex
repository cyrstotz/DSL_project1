The generated entropy, denoted as \( S_{\text{erz}} \), is calculated as the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference in entropy between state \( s_a \) and \( s_e \), minus the heat flow rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \) divided by the reactor temperature \( T_{\text{Reaktor}} \), and minus the heat flow rate \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \) divided by the temperature \( T_{\text{KF}} \), evaluated at the wall. This results in \( S_{\text{erz}} \) being equal to \( 0.4476 \) kilowatts per Kelvin.

The change in energy from \( E_1 \) to \( E_2 \) is given by the equation \( (m_{gs} + \Delta m) u_2 - m_{gs} u_1 \).

The specific internal energy \( u_1 \) at 100 degrees Celsius and quality \( x = 0.005 \) is calculated using the formula \( u_f + x (u_g - u_f) \) and equals \( 929.378 \) kilojoules per kilogram, as taken from table A-2.

The specific internal energy \( u_2 \) at 70 degrees Celsius and quality \( x = 0 \) is \( 292.95 \) kilojoules per kilogram, also from table A-2.

The equation \( (m_{gs} + \Delta m) u_2 - m_{gs} u_1 = \Delta m h_{12} + Q_{\text{aus}} \) is used to find the change in mass \( \Delta m \), which is calculated as \( \frac{Q_{\text{aus}} + m_{gs} (u_1 - u_2)}{u_2 - h_{12}} \) and results in \( 358932 \) kilograms.

The change in entropy \( \Delta S \) is calculated using the formula \( \Delta m_{gs} (s_{gs} + \Delta m) s_2 - m_{gs} s_1 \).

The specific entropy \( s_1 \) at 100 degrees Celsius and quality \( x = 0.005 \) is \( s_f + x (s_g - s_f) = 1.337 \) kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, from table A-2.

The specific entropy \( s_2 \) at 70 degrees Celsius and quality \( x = 0 \) is \( 0.9599 \) kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, also from table A-2.

The resulting change in entropy \( \Delta S \) is calculated as \( 929.37 \) kilograms times \( 0.9599 \) minus \( 5755 \) times \( 1.337 \), resulting in \( 1228.5 \) kilojoules per Kelvin.
