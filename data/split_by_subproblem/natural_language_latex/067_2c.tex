The change in exergy due to the stream, denoted as Delta e_x, str, is equal to e_x, str, a minus e_x, str, e, which is equal to h_a minus h_e minus T_0 times (s_a minus s_e) plus Delta ke.

Delta ke is equal to half of w_5 squared minus half of w_6 squared, which equals 108.651 Joules or 108.651 kilojoules per kilogram.

h_a minus h_e equals c_p star times (T_6 minus T_0), which is 85.430 kilojoules per kilogram.

s_a minus s_e equals c_p star times the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0) minus R times the natural logarithm of (p_6 divided by p_0), which equals 0.301 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

q equals c_p star times T_0 minus c_p star times T_0 times the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0), which equals 0.2874 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, Delta e_x, str equals 120.89 kilojoules per kilogram.
