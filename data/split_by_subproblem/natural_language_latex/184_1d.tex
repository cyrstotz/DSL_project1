The heating temperature, T_heat, is 100 degrees Celsius.

x equals 0.005.

The average temperature, T_bar, is 20 degrees Celsius.

The mass of g2, m_g2, is 5755 kilograms.

The equation for the mass difference between g2 and u2 is m_g2 minus m_u2 equals Delta m times h plus Sigma Q.

The equation for Delta m is (m_g2 minus m_u2 minus Q) divided by h.

The value of h is 83.96 kilojoules per kilogram, taken from table A2 at 20 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy at u2, h_u2, at 70 degrees Celsius is 252.35 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at u1, h_u1, at 100 degrees Celsius is 418.94 kilojoules per kilogram.

m1 equals 5755.

Delta m is approximately calculated as (5755 minus 252.35 times 10 to the power of 3 minus 5755 minus 418.94 times 10 to the power of 3 minus 35 times 10 to the power of 6) divided by (83.96 times 10 to the power of 3 minus 252.35 times 10 to the power of 3), which approximately equals 3.637 tons.
