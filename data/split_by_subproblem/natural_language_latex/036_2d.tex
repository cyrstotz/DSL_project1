The rate of exergy loss, denoted as E-dot subscript x, verl, equals the initial temperature T0 times the rate of entropy generation S-dot subscript evz, where the initial temperature t0 is 243.15 Kelvin.

From the entropy balance, the change in the rate of entropy generation S-dot subscript evz is described by the equation:
0 equals the mass flow rate m-dot times the difference in entropy between the exit and the entrance (s subscript e minus s subscript a) plus the heat transfer rate Q-dot divided by the temperature T subscript y, plus the irreversible entropy generation rate S-dot subscript irr, evz.

The change in the rate of entropy generation S-dot subscript evz is equal to the difference in entropy between the entrance and the exit (s subscript a minus s subscript e) minus the heat transfer rate Q-dot divided by the temperature T subscript jin, which simplifies to the difference in a standard entropy state (s subscript 0 minus s subscript 0) minus the heat transfer rate q subscript b divided by 7283 Kelvin.

The difference in the standard entropy states s subscript 0 minus s subscript 0 equals 0.337 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, which simplifies to 0.337 minus 1.195 divided by 7283 Kelvin.
The rate of entropy generation S-dot subscript evz equals -0.59, and there is a note that an error must be 70.

Finally, the rate of exergy loss E-dot subscript x, verl, is calculated as 243.15 Kelvin times the rate of entropy generation S-dot subscript evz.
