a) Balance Reactor: Stationary Flow Process with mass flow rate (m dot)

Zero equals m dot times the difference of enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entrance plus the difference of the squares of angular velocity at exit and entrance divided by two plus gravitational acceleration times the difference in height between exit and entrance plus the heat transfer out plus the work done plus the heat transfer at entrance.

Zero equals m dot times the difference of enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entrance minus the heat transfer out plus the heat transfer at entrance.

The heat transfer out equals m dot times the difference between enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entrance plus the heat transfer at entrance.

Enthalpy at exit from Table A-2 at 70 degrees Celsius: enthalpy at exit equals enthalpy at fluid equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

Enthalpy at entrance from Table A-2 at 100 degrees Celsius: enthalpy at entrance equals enthalpy at fluid equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat transfer out equals 0.3 kilograms per second times (292.98 kilojoules per kilogram minus 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram) plus 100 kilowatts.

Equals 62.182 kilowatts.
