Steady flow process where kinetic energy (ke) and potential energy (pe) are zero. The equation O equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times the difference in enthalpy between exit (h_e) and entrance (h_a) plus the heat transfer rate (Q dot R), which equals the heat output (Q dot aus) minus work (W), where work (W) equals zero. This results in zero equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times the difference in enthalpy between exit and entrance plus the heat transfer rate (Q dot R) equals 0.3 times the difference between 292.98 and 448.04 plus 100 kilowatts, which equals 62.782 kilowatts.

The mass flow rate (m dot) is 0.3 kilograms per second. The enthalpy at exit (h_e) is the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius. The enthalpy at entrance (h_a) is the enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram, equal to 448.04 kilojoules per kilogram.
