Graphical Description:

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy diagram. The vertical axis is labeled T in Kelvin and the horizontal axis is labeled s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. There are three isobars drawn in red, labeled P2 equals P3, P1 equals P4 equals P5, and P6 equals P0.

There are six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by various lines:
- Point 1 to Point 2 is a vertical line.
- Point 2 to Point 3 is a curved line.
- Point 3 to Point 4 is a vertical line.
- Point 4 to Point 5 is a curved line.
- Point 5 to Point 6 is a vertical line.
- Point 6 to Point 1 is a curved line.

The lines connecting Points 1 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 to 6 are in black, while the lines connecting Points 2 to 3, 4 to 5, and 6 to 1 are in blue. The points are marked with small circles, and the lines are annotated with mH and mK.
