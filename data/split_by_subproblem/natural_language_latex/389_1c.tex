The equation is the derivative of S with respect to t equals the sum of dot Q sub i over T plus S sub generated. The generated entropy, S sub generated, equals negative dot Q over T, which equals 65 kilowatts over 293.12 Kelvin, resulting in 0.2218 kilojoules per Kelvin per second, and this value is equal to S sub generated.
