The extended exergy \( e_{x, \text{verl}} \) is equal to \( T_0 \) times \( \dot{s}_{\text{erz}} \).
The equation \( 0 = m (s_0 - s_1) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} + \dot{s}_{\text{erz}} \) is given, where it is noted that this is for an adiabatic engine.
The generated entropy \( \dot{s}_{\text{erz}} \) is equal to \( s_1 - s_0 + \frac{\dot{q}}{T} \).
The generated entropy \( \dot{s}_{\text{erz}} \) is also given by \( c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_1}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_1}{p_0} \right) \).
The extended exergy \( e_{x, \text{verl}} \) is then \( T_0 c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_1}{T_0} \right) \).
The temperature \( T_0 \) is given as \( 243.15 \, \text{K} \).
Finally, the extended exergy \( e_{x, \text{verl}} \) is calculated as \( 243.15 \, \text{K} \times 1.004 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}} \ln \left( \frac{374.0 \, \text{K}}{243.15 \, \text{K}} \right) \) which equals \( 82.009 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \).
