The flow rate, w_C, is 5 cubic meters per second, and the temperature, T_G, is 340 Kelvin.

From the formula collection:
The change in specific exergy, Delta ex_{s,k}, is equal to h_G minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_G minus s_0) plus half the square of w_G minus half the square of w_0.

The difference h_G minus h_0 is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, times the difference in temperature (T_G minus T_0).

The difference s_G minus s_0 is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_G to T_0 minus the gas constant, R, times the natural logarithm of the ratio of pressure P_G to P_0.

This leads to the expression:
c_p times (T_G minus T_0) minus T_0 times c_p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T_G to T_0 plus half the square of w_G minus half the square of w_0 equals 125.47 kilojoules per kilogram.
