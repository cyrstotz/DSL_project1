Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat input. The enthalpy at the inlet for water at 70 degrees Celsius is 292.92 kilojoules per kilogram. The enthalpy at the outlet for water at 40 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram. The heat input is 62.482 kilowatts.
