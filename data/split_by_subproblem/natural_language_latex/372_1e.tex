The rate of change of entropy S with respect to time t is equal to the sum over i of the product of the mass flow rate m-dot subscript i and entropy s subscript i plus the heat transfer rate Q-dot divided by the temperature T, minus the entropy generation rate S-dot subscript cr,2.

The change in entropy Delta S from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the integral of the product of the mass flow rate m-dot subscript 12 and the difference in entropy s2 minus s1 minus the heat transfer rate Q-dot subscript 12 divided by the temperature T, which equals the entropy generation rate S-dot subscript cr,2.
