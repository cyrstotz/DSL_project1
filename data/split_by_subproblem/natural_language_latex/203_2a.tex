The graph is described as a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with entropy S in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled with temperature T in Kelvin. The graph displays a cycle with six points labeled from 1 to 6. The process between points 1 and 2 is labeled as "isobar", the process between points 2 and 3 is also labeled as "isobar", the process between points 3 and 4 is labeled as "isentrop", the process between points 4 and 5 is labeled as "isobar", the process between points 5 and 6 is labeled as "isobar", and the process between points 6 and 1 is labeled as "isentrop". The cycle is illustrated using a combination of curved and straight lines.
