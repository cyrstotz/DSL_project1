Change in energy, Delta E, is equal to zero as the term Delta m_12 times (h_2 minus h_1) is canceled out.

Delta E equals Delta m_12 times the difference of h_2 and h_1, minus Q_aus,12 plus Q_dot_R,12.

This further simplifies to m_2 times u_2 minus m_1 times u_1, which equals (m_1 plus Delta m_12) times u_2 minus m_1 times u_1.

Values provided are as follows:
- h_1, the enthalpy at 20 degrees Celsius, is 83.96 kilojoules per kilogram.
- h_2, the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius, is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.
- u_1, the internal energy at 20 degrees Celsius, is 83.95 kilojoules per kilogram.
- u_2, the internal energy at 70 degrees Celsius, is 292.95 kilojoules per kilogram.
- m_1, the mass, is 5755 kilograms.

The expression Delta m_12 times the difference of h_2 and h_1 equals m_1 times u_2 plus Delta m_12 times u_2 minus m_1 times u_1.

Delta m_12 is calculated as (m_1 times u_2 minus m_1 times u_1) divided by (h_2 minus h_1 minus u_2), which results in 28549 kilograms.
