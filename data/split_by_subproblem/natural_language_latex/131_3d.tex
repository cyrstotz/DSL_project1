For subtask (d), the circle efficiency, denoted as epsilon_c, is given by the formula:
epsilon_c equals the absolute value of Q_dot_k divided by the absolute value of Q_dot_u1 minus Q_dot_u2, which simplifies to Q_dot_k divided by the absolute value of Q_dot_u1 minus Q_dot_k.

For subtask (e), the text indicates that the performance would change, but no specific details or mathematical expression is provided.
