Zero equals the product of mass flow rate (m dot) and the difference between h2 and h3, plus heat transfer rate (Q dot) minus work rate (W dot).

The ratio of the work rate of the internal combustion (W_ic dot) to the difference between h2 and h3 equals the mass flow rate (m dot).

This implies that the mass flow rate (m dot) equals the ratio of the internal combustion work (W_ic) to the difference between h2 and h3.

h2 at x2 equals 1 (at temperature T2).

h3 at pressure p3 equals 8 bar (at temperature T3).
