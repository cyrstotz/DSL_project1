The expression G_u equals the absolute value of dot Q with subscript 'zul' divided by the absolute value of dot W with subscript 'e'.

This is equal to dot Q with subscript 'zu' divided by the absolute value of dot Q with subscript 'alt' minus dot Q with subscript 'zul'.

This further simplifies to a fraction where the numerator is represented by dashes (indicating an unspecified or unknown value) and the denominator is 28 w.
