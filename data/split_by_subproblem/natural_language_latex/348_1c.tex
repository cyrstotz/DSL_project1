c) Seitz â†’ In the context of heat transport:
Without mass flow, stationary:
The equation is zero equals the sum of Q dot over T sub i plus S dot with subscript 'er'.

S dot with subscript 'er' equals negative sum of Q dot over T sub i, which equals negative Q sub 'ein' over T sub 'ein' plus Q dot over T sub 'm', equals 45.5 Watts.

A horizontal line is drawn.

Q equals 62.182 kilowatts.
