The rate of heat transfer Q dot subscript k equals the mass flow rate m dot subscript R134a times the difference in enthalpy h subscript A1 minus h subscript A2.

The effectiveness epsilon subscript k equals the absolute value of Q dot subscript ab divided by the absolute value of W subscript t, which equals the absolute value of Q dot subscript AB divided by the sum of the absolute value of W subscript t and the absolute value of Q dot subscript k.
