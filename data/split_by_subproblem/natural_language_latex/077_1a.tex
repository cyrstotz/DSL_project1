Energy balance:
The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 1 and state 2, plus 100 kilowatts, minus the heat output equals zero (under steady state conditions).

The mass flow rate at enthalpy h1 is at 90 degrees Celsius and it is an ideal fluid.
Enthalpy h2 is at 100 degrees Celsius, meaning it does not depend on pressure.

Enthalpy h1 at 90 degrees Celsius equals 292.98.
Enthalpy h2 at 100 degrees Celsius equals 419.04.

The heat output is calculated as 0.3 kilograms per second times (292.98 minus 419.04) kilojoules per kilogram plus 100 kilojoules per second equals the heat output.

Negative 37.82 kilojoules per second plus 100 kilojoules per second equals 62.182 kilojoules per second, which is 62.182 kilowatts.
