The equation is the rate of change of kinetic energy E_k dot equals the absolute value of Q_u dot divided by the absolute value of W_r.

The equation a squared times u equals Q_u.

In the stationary state, the equation zero equals dot m times the difference h_1 minus h_2 plus Q_u.

The equation Q_u equals dot m times the difference h_2 minus h_1.
