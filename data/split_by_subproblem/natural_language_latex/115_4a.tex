The graph has a vertical axis labeled "Ice" and a horizontal axis labeled "T". There is a curve starting from the origin, moving upwards and to the right, labeled "Ice". The curve then bends downwards and to the right, labeled "Water". There is a horizontal line segment labeled "f" intersecting the curve at a point labeled "C". The vertical distance from the horizontal axis to the point "C" is labeled "f". The curve continues to the right and slightly downwards, ending at a point labeled "D".

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as "p" and the horizontal axis labeled as "T". There is a curve starting from the origin and rising upwards to the right, labeled as "Saturation Vapor". A vertical line is drawn from a point on the curve upwards, labeled as "isotherm". A horizontal line is drawn from the same point to the right, labeled as "isobar". Another horizontal line is drawn from a point on the curve to the left, labeled as "isotherm". The intersection of the isotherm and isobar lines is marked with a dot.
