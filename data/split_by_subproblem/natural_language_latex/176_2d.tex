Q equals the total change in exergy plus the change in exergy due to heat plus the remaining times the exergy loss. 
Q equals the total change in exergy plus the change in exergy due to heat minus the remaining times the exergy loss.
This applies to the transition from turbine to compressor.
Minus the exergy loss.

The change in exergy due to heat equals one minus the ratio of T2 over T0, all multiplied by Q.
Q equals one minus the ratio of T2 over T0, all multiplied by 1.195 times the square of w0 per kg.

The change in exergy loss equals the total change in exergy plus the change in exergy due to heat.
