A. The gas is closed.
The change in energy, E2 minus E1, equals the heat added, Qk, minus the work done, W.
The work done, W, equals the integral from V1 to V2 of P3,1 dV, which equals P3,4 times (V2 minus V1).
The mass of the substance, ms, times the change in internal energy, u2 minus u1, equals the heat added to the mass, Qm2, minus the work done, W.
The change in internal energy, u2 minus u1, equals the integral from T1 to T2 of cv dT, which equals cv times (T2 minus T1).
The heat added, Qu2, equals P3,1 times (ck minus h) times the mass of the substance, ms, plus cv times ms times (T2 minus T1).

Continuing with:
The product of pressure, p, and volume, V, equals the mass, m, times the gas constant, R, times the temperature, T.
The volume V2 equals the mass, m, times the gas constant, R, times the temperature T2, divided by the pressure ps2, which equals 9.0115 cubic meters per cubic meter.
The heat flow rate, Q dot 12, equals negative 1116.3 Joules.
