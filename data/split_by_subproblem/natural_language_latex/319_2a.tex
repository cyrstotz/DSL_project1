The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as 's' in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as 'T' in Kelvin. There are three curves plotted on the graph, each representing different pressures. The curves are labeled as follows:
- The topmost curve is labeled 'p equals 0.5 bar'.
- The middle curve is labeled 'p equals 0.2 bar'.
- The bottom curve is labeled 'p equals 0.1 bar'.
Each curve starts from a common point on the y-axis and diverges as it moves to the right along the x-axis. The curves are smooth and upward sloping, indicating a positive relationship between 'T' and 's' for each pressure level.
