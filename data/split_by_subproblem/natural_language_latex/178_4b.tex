The equations are as follows:

1. The mass flow rate m dot equals m dot one plus m dot two, x subscript t equals one, h.

2. The derivative with respect to time of the integral over t equals m dot times the difference between h three and h two minus V dot subscript k plus Q dot superscript o.

3. V dot subscript k equals m dot times the difference between h one and h two.

4. s subscript two equals s subscript three.
