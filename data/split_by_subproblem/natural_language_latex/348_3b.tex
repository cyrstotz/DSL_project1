The value of x subscript "Eis" approaches zero.

The pressure must decrease significantly! Then a new equilibrium.

The equation p subscript "S2" equals p subscript "S1" approaches 1.15 bar.

Thermal equilibrium in state 2!

Temperatures are equal, thus T Eis remains at 0 degrees Celsius, since in the wet steam region the boiling temperature.

The equation T subscript "S1" equals T subscript "S2" approaches 0 degrees Celsius.
