The process reactor is isothermal, since the steam also (line left blank for completion).

Energy balance of the reactor:
The sum of heat output \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) and heat flow rate \( \dot{Q} \).

It is stationary:
\[ 0 = \dot{m} (\text{chemical input}) + \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{m}_h \]

Work \( W = 0 \), since there is no external work (text incomplete or unclear).

This leads to the change in energy over time due to heat of vaporization.

Conservation:
The temperature \( T \) is 100 degrees Celsius, indicating saturated boiling, leading to \( hf \).

From table 42 at \( T = 100^\circ C \), the value is 282.98 kJ/kg.

\( ha \): Decrease to saturated boiling liquid at \( T_{\text{aus}} = 100^\circ C \) from table (Lf) at \( T = 100^\circ C \) equals 419.07 kJ/kg.

The heat output \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) is calculated as:
\[ Q_{\text{aus}} = \dot{m} (\text{ha-he}) - Q_a = -62.182 \text{kW} \]
