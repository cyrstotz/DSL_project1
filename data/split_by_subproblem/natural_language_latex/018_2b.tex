w_6 equals what? T_6 equals what?

The reverse work w_rev is equal to the integral from 0 to 6 of p dv, which equals p.

The ratio of T_6 to T_0 is equal to the ratio of T_6 to T_5 times the ratio of P_6 to P_5 raised to the power of (n-1) over n.

This implies that T_6 equals T_5 times the ratio of P_0 to P_5 raised to the power of (n-1) over n, which equals 431.9 Kelvin times the ratio of 0.194 bar to 0.5 bar raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4, resulting in T_6 equals 328.075 Kelvin.

Isotropic process where n equals k equals 1.4.

In the equation for stationary state 1x m:
0 equals the mass flow rate (m dot) times (h_2 minus h_3) plus the difference of w_2 squared and w_3 squared over 2 plus the product of Z dot and Q double dot minus the product of Z dot and W_e double dot.
