The graph description details a plot with the vertical axis labeled as T and the horizontal axis labeled as s. The curve begins at the origin, labeled as point 0, ascends to a peak at point 3, and then descends. The curve has several marked points: point 1 is located on the ascending part of the curve, point 2 is at the peak, point 3 is slightly to the right of the peak, point 4 is on the descending part of the curve, and point 6 is at the end of the curve. Additionally, there are isobaric lines labeled as P0 equals P6, P1, and P3.
