The energy E_k is equal to the ratio of the heat input rate dot Q_zu to the work rate dot W_k. The heat input rate dot Q_zu is equal to the mass flow rate dot m times the difference in enthalpy from state 2 to state 1, which is calculated as a over 3600 kilograms per second times the difference in enthalpy 293.72 kilojoules per kilogram minus 93.92 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in 167 Watts. Therefore, the energy E_k is equal to 167 Watts divided by 28 Watts, which equals approximately 5.9693.
