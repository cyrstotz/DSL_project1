Graph Description:

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled T in Kelvin and the horizontal axis is labeled s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph contains several points and lines:

- Point O at the origin.
- Point A above O.
- Point 2 to the right of A.
- Point 3 above 2.
- Point 4 to the right of 3.
- Point 5 above 4.
- Point 6 below 5.

The lines connecting these points are as follows:

- A line from O to A.
- A vertical line from A to 2.
- A horizontal line from 2 to 3.
- A vertical line from 3 to 4.
- A horizontal line from 4 to 5.
- A vertical line from 5 to 6.
- A curved line from 6 back to O.

There are also dashed lines indicating constant pressure:
- P_A from A to 2.
- P_2 equals P_3 from 2 to 3.
- P_4 equals P_5 from 4 to 5.
- P_0 equals P_6 from 6 to O.
