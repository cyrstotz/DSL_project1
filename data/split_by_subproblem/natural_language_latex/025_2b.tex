b) w_6, T_6 equals question mark.

Energy balance at the thrust nozzle:

Zero equals m dot times (h_5 minus h_6 plus (w_5 squared minus w_6 squared) divided by 2) implies w_6.

h_5 equals question mark, p_5 equals 0.8 bar.

T_5 equals 458.75 Kelvin (from isentropic state).

T_6 equals question mark, isentropic: Polytropic state line:

T_6 equals T_5 times (p_6 over p_5) raised to the power of (k minus 1 over k) equals 328.0 Kelvin.

h_5 minus h_6 equals c_p times (T_5 minus T_6) equals 104.453 kilojoules per kilogram.

(w_5 squared divided by 2) minus 104.453 kilojoules per kilogram equals w_6 squared divided by 2.

2 times ((w_5 squared divided by 2) plus 104.453 times 10^3 joules per kilogram) equals w_6 squared.

w_6 equals the square root of (w_5 squared plus 2 times 104.453 times 10^3 joules per kilogram).

w_6 equals the square root of 507.253 meters squared per second squared.
