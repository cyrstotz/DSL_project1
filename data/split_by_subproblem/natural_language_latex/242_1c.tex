c) Theorem from thermodynamics

Wall second law of the theory

implies entropy balance equation zero equals the sum of mass flow rate times entropy plus the heat flow rate out divided by the reference temperature minus the heat flow out divided by the condensation temperature plus generated entropy.

implies generated entropy equals the heat flow out divided by the condensation temperature minus the heat flow out divided by the reference temperature, where the reference temperature for isothermal wet steam equals 373.15 Kelvin.

equals 62.13 divided by 5.46 times 2 over 5 Kelvin equals 45.46 kilojoules per Kelvin.
