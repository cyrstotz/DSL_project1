The equations are as follows:

1. The rate of change of extended energy, denoted as E with a dot on top subscript x,verl, equals ex subscript verl,mas.

2. Zero equals negative delta E with a dot on top subscript xstr plus ex subscript q,s minus W subscript trn minus ex subscript verl.

3. ex subscript q equals the quantity one minus the ratio of T subscript zero over T subscript B, all multiplied by the ratio of Q with a dot on top over m with a dot on top.

4. A horizontal line of approximately 5 centimeters in length.
