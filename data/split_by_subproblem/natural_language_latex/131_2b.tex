The temperature \( T_{EU,2} \) is 0 degrees Celsius. Because it is the enthalpy of ice, the temperature remains at 0 degrees Celsius. The pressure \( p_{EU,2} \) equals \( p_{s,1} \), which is 135565.5 Pascals. The external force on the system and the area of the cylinder and the volume of ice remain the same, and therefore the pressure also remains the same.
