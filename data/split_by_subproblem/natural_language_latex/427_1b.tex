C equals a constant implies that the difference between the entropy S at temperature 298.15 Kelvin and the entropy S at temperature 298.15 Kelvin equals the integral from T1 to T2 of 1 over T with respect to T, which equals C times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T2 to T1.

The average temperature T_KF equals the integral from initial entropy S_a to final entropy S_e of T ds divided by the difference between S_a and S_e, which equals the difference between T_aS_a and T_eS_e divided by C times the natural logarithm of the ratio of 298.15 Kelvin to 298.15 Kelvin, which approximately equals 298 Kelvin.
