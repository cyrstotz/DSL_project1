The graph description includes a plot with the x-axis labeled as s in units of kilojoules per Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin. The graph features several points connected by lines:
- Point 1 is located at the bottom left.
- Point 2 is directly above Point 1.
- Point 3 is to the right of Point 2 and is connected to it by a horizontal line.
- Point 4 is below Point 3 and is connected to it by a vertical line.
- Point 5 is to the right of Point 4 and is connected to it by a horizontal line.
- Point 6 is below Point 5 and is connected to it by a vertical line.
- Point 0 is to the left of Point 6 and is connected to it by a curved line.

The points are labeled as follows:
- \( p_{2,3} \) is labeled at the top of the vertical line between points 2 and 3.
- \( p_{4,5} \) is labeled at the top of the vertical line between points 4 and 5.
- \( p_0 \) is labeled at the top of the curved line connecting points 0 and 6.

The equations provided are:
- \( \dot{q} = \dot{m} \cdot \left( \frac{h_2}{h_1} \right) \)
- \( \dot{w} = \dot{m} \cdot \left( \frac{h_2}{h_1} \right) \)
- \( 0 = -\Delta e_{x,str} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) \cdot \dot{q} - \dot{w}_c - e_{x,vel} \)
- \( e_{x,vel} = -\Delta e_{x,str} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) \cdot \dot{q} - \dot{w}_c \)
