The equations given are:

1. The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy at the inlet and outlet plus the heat transfer equals zero:
   \[
   \dot{m}_{123} (h_{ein} - h_{aus}) + Q_{12} = 0
   \]
   Rearranging the equation, the mass flow rate is equal to the heat transfer divided by the difference in enthalpy between two states:
   \[
   Q_{12} = \dot{m}_{123} (h_{ein} - h_{1}) \rightarrow \dot{m}_{123} = \frac{Q_{12}}{h_{2} - h_{1}}
   \]

Below these equations, annotations include:
- "isobaric evaporation"
- "1 -> 2"
- "GK = Tv"
- "saturated steam"
- "2 -> 3"
- "adiabatic"
- "reversible"

2. The second set of equations:
   The mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between two states plus the rate of heat transfer equals the rate of work:
   \[
   \dot{m}_{23} (h_{2} - h_{3}) + \dot{Q} = \dot{W}_{K}
   \]
   Rearranging the equation, the mass flow rate is equal to the rate of work divided by the difference in enthalpy between two states:
   \[
   \dot{m}_{23} = \frac{\dot{W}_{K}}{h_{2} - h_{3}}
   \]

Additional notes include:
- The rate of work is given as "-28 W".
- A crossed-out section with annotations "h_{2}", "h_{3} (3 bar)", and "cannot find".
- At the bottom, there is a note stating "s2 = s3".
