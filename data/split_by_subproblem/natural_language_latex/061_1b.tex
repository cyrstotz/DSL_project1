Zero equals m dot times the difference between s sub e and s sub a plus the sum.

The integral from s sub a to s sub e of T ds equals the crossed out integral from s sub a to s sub e of (s sub a minus s sub e).

The average T, denoted as T bar, equals the integral from s sub a to s sub e of T ds divided by (s sub a minus s sub e).

s sub a equals 7.3069.

s sub e equals 0.9549.

T sub a times s sub a minus T sub e times s sub e equals 343.75 times 0.9549 plus 373.75 times 7.3069.

This equals 487.6697 minus 327.6179.

Which equals 159.996.

s sub a minus s sub e equals 0.352.

The average T, denoted as T bar, equals 159.996 divided by 0.352, which results in 159.996.
