Sigma equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance times the heat flow rate over temperature plus the entropy generation rate.

The entropy generation rate equals negative the heat flow rate over temperature plus the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the exit and the entropy at the entrance.

This equals the fraction 3481 over 255 plus 0.5 times an unspecified value.

This results in 9.022 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.

On the right side of the page, there are two notes:
- The entropy at the exit is 995.65 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.
- The entropy at the entrance is 7.3069 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.
