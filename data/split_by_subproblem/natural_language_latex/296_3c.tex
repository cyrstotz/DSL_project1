The equations are as follows:

1. The change in time for EIS, denoted as dt_EIS, equals the difference between T_0 and Q_m divided by m.

2. The product of m and the change in internal energy, denoted as Delta u, equals Q_m.

3. The integral from T_0 to T_m of the specific heat capacity c_p(T) with respect to temperature T, multiplied by m, equals Q_m.

4. This is further calculated as 3.422 grams times 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference between 500 degrees Celsius and 0.003 degrees Celsius, which equals 1082.998 kilojoules.
