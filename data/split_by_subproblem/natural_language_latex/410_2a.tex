The graph is a Temperature (T) versus Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as S in units of kilojoules per Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled as T in Kelvin. There are five points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The curve starts at point 1, rises to point 2, then to point 3, and continues to point 4. From point 4, it drops down to point 5. The segment from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isentropic", the segment from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "heating", the segment from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "heating", and the segment from point 4 to point 5 is labeled "isentropic". Point 4 is also labeled "Critical Point".
