The change in energy, denoted as Delta E, equals E2 minus E1, which is equal to Q12.

This implies that Q12 equals Delta U, which is equal to the negative product of the mass of gas, m_g, the specific heat at constant volume, c_V, and the difference in temperature from T2,G to T1,G. This is calculated as negative 0.00342 kilograms times 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin times the difference between 773.15 Kelvin and 293.15 Kelvin.

This results in negative 1.052 kilojoules.
