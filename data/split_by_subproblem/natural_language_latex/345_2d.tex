The rate of exergy destruction, denoted as dot E subscript ex, verl, equals the ambient temperature T_0 multiplied by the rate of entropy generation, dot S subscript verl.

The rate of entropy generation, dot S subscript verl, equals the total mass flow rate, dot m subscript ges, multiplied by the difference in entropy between s_9 and s_c.

The specific exergy destruction rate, dot e subscript ex, verl, equals the ambient temperature T_0 multiplied by the difference in entropy between s_6 and s_0, which equals 73.26 kilojoules per kilogram.
