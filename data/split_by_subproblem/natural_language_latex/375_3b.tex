The pressure \( p_{s2} \) equals \( p_{s1} \) because the same pressure is exerted on it, which is \( 140084 \) Pascals.

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) equals zero because the process is adiabatic. This implies that zero equals \( m_2 \) times the change in specific internal energy \( \Delta u \) plus \( m \).
