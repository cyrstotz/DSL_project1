The system is in thermodynamic equilibrium and isolated from the outside (no heat exchange). Therefore, the temperature T1,2 must be equal to the environmental temperature T_env, which is 0 degrees Celsius. Since the ambient pressure and the pressure from the piston remain unchanged (masses are equal), the pressure p3,2 equals p3,1, which is 1.9 bar.
