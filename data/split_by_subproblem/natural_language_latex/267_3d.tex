Energy balance for water (closed, isobaric, isochoric):

The change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the heat added, thus the internal energy at state 2 is equal to the heat added per unit mass of water plus the internal energy at state 1, which approximately equals negative 789.970 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy at state 2 is equal to the internal energy of liquid water plus the quality (fraction of mass that is solid) times the difference between the internal energy of solid and liquid water. Solving for the quality, it is approximately equal to 0.555.

The temperature is 0.01 degrees Celsius.
