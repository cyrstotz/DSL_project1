The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled 's' in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled 'T' in Kelvin. The graph consists of several curves and points:
- Point 0 at the origin.
- A curve from point 0 to point 1 labeled "adiabatic".
- A curve from point 1 to point 2 labeled "isotherm".
- A curve from point 2 to point 3 labeled "isobar".
- A curve from point 3 to point 4 labeled "adiabatic, inner".
- A curve from point 4 to point 5 labeled "isotherm, isobar".
- A curve from point 5 to point 6 labeled "isentropic".
- The points 3, 4, and 5 are connected by a dashed line labeled 'p3 equals p2'.
- The points 4 and 6 are connected by a dashed line labeled 'p6 equals p0'.
