The change in entropy, denoted as Delta S_12, is equal to S_2 minus S_1, which is further expressed as h_A2 times s_2 minus h_A1 times s_1, and this equals Delta m_dot_12 times Delta s_12.

For a semi-open system:

S_1 at 20 degrees Celsius equals 0.2966 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

S_2 is calculated as the entropy at the fluid state at 70 degrees Celsius plus x_D times the difference between the entropy at the gas state and the fluid state at 70 degrees Celsius. This results in:

0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin plus 0.005 times (7.7353 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin), which equals 0.9889 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Finally, Delta S_12 is calculated as 3600 kilograms per hour times the difference between 0.9889 and 0.2966 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, resulting in 2492.29 kilojoules per Kelvin.
