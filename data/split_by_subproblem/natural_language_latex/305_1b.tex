The expression T equals the integral from s_e to s_a of T dS divided by s_e minus s_a, which equals h_a minus h_e divided by s_a minus s_e, which equals T_a minus T_e plus dot v times the fraction p_a minus p_e over p_a minus p_e, all divided by dot v times the natural logarithm of T_a over T_e.

T equals T_a minus T_e divided by the natural logarithm of T_a over T_e, which equals 298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of 298.15 Kelvin over 288.15 Kelvin, which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
