- The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram.
- The vertical axis is labeled T in Kelvin.
- The horizontal axis is labeled s in units of inverse kilograms.
- There are three isobaric lines labeled as follows:
  - p2 over p3
  - p5 equals p4
  - p0 equals p0
- Points are labeled on the graph as follows:
  - Point 0 at the origin.
  - Point 1 slightly to the right of point 0.
  - Point 2 above point 1.
  - Point 3 above point 2.
  - Point 4 to the right of point 3.
  - Point 5 to the right of point 4.
  - Point 6 below point 5.
  - Point 7 below point 6.
- The following equations are written next to the graph:
  - Eta equals the ratio of W dot over Q dot.
  - Eta equals the ratio of nRT over pV.
  - T equals the ratio of rho times V raised to the power of gamma minus one, over nR.
