a) Energy balance:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat rate added minus the heat rate removed.

The heat rate removed equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat rate added.

The enthalpy at the inlet, at 70 degrees Celsius, is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram (refer to Table A-2).

The enthalpy at the outlet, at 100 degrees Celsius, is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram (refer to Table A-2).

The heat rate removed equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram and 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram plus 100 kilowatts.

This equals 62.182 kilowatts.
