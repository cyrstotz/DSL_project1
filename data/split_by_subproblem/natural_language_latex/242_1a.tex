a) Energy balance for water

Implies zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat input minus the heat output.

The enthalpy at the inlet, denoted as \( h_{\text{ein}} \), is the enthalpy of fluid at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 232.98 kilojoules per kilogram, reference (A-2).

The enthalpy at the outlet, denoted as \( h_{\text{aus}} \), is the enthalpy of fluid at 80 degrees Celsius, which is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram, reference (A-2).

Implies the absolute value of the heat output equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat input.

This equals 62.13 kilojoules per second.

Implies, since realized, the heat output \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) is negative 62.13 kilojoules per second, which is equivalent to negative 62.13 kilowatts.
