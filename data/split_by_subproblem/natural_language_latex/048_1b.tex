The average temperature T-bar subscript KF for an ideal fluid is given by the integral of T ds from S subscript a to S subscript e, divided by the difference S subscript a minus S subscript e. 

The average temperature T-bar subscript KF is also calculated as the average of T subscript KF,us and T subscript KF,in, which leads to the calculation (258.75 Kelvin plus 238.15 Kelvin) divided by 2.

This results in 293.15 Kelvin.
