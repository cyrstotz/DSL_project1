The change in specific exergy due to the stream, denoted as Delta e subscript x, str, is equal to e subscript x, str, e minus e subscript x, str, 0.

The expression for Delta e subscript x, str is given by:
Delta e subscript x, str equals h minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s minus s_0) plus c times u squared over 2,
which simplifies to h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus c times u squared over 2,
and further simplifies to C_p times (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus c times u squared over 2.

The values for T_0 and T_6 are given as 293 Kelvin and 328.07 Kelvin respectively.

The change in entropy, s_6 minus s_0, is calculated as the integral from T_1 to T_2 of C_p over T dT minus R times the natural logarithm of (p_6 over p_0).

Given that the ratio p_6 over p_0 equals 1, the natural logarithm of 1 equals 0, and thus,
s_6 minus s_0 equals C_p times the natural logarithm of (T_6 over T_0) minus R times the natural logarithm of (p_6 over p_0).

The gas constant R is defined as C_p minus C_v, which equals C_p minus C_p over kappa, and is given as 0.2874.

C_v is defined as C_p over kappa.

Therefore, s_6 minus s_0 equals C_p times the natural logarithm of (328.07 over 293) minus 293 times 0.2874 plus c times u squared over 2, resulting in 2.6974 Joules per gram Kelvin.
