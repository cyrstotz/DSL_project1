b) 5-6 isotherm nic 7.4

The temperature at state 6, T6, equals the temperature at state 5, T5, times the ratio of pressure at state 6 to pressure at state 5 raised to the power of (gamma minus one) divided by gamma, which equals 328.02797 Kelvin.

HS Durch (HS Through):

The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate times the quantity of enthalpy at state 5 minus enthalpy at state 6 plus half the difference of the square of velocity at state 5 and the square of velocity at state 6, plus the heat transfer rate, where the heat transfer rate is zero.

Twice the difference of enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 5 equals the difference of the square of velocity at state 5 and the square of velocity at state 6.

This implies that the square of velocity at state 6 equals the square of velocity at state 5 minus twice the difference of enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 5. Therefore, the velocity at state 6 equals the square root of the square of velocity at state 5 minus twice the difference of enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 5, which equals the square root of 507.2 meters squared per second squared, resulting in a velocity at state 6 of 200 meters per second.

The difference in enthalpy between state 6 and state 5 equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between state 6 and state 5, which equals negative 10 kilojoules per kilogram.
