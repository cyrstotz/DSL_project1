Epsilon_c equals the absolute value of Q_dot_1 over W_dot_t, which is equal to the absolute value of Q_dot_1 divided by W_dot_t.

From the energy balance on the isobaric evaporator, denoted as D: zero equals m_dot times (h_1 minus h_2) plus Q_dot_k minus W_dot_k.

Therefore, epsilon_c equals m_dot times (h_2 minus h_1) divided by W_dot_k.
