The average temperature for the cooling fluid, denoted as T-bar subscript KF.

The heat flow rate for the cooling fluid, denoted as Q-dot subscript KF, is constant, which implies that the average temperature of the cooling fluid, T-bar subscript KF, equals the average of the room temperature, T subscript raum, and the inlet temperature, T subscript ein. This is calculated as the sum of 293.15 Kelvin and 293.15 Kelvin, all divided by 2.

The temperature of the cooling fluid, T subscript KF, equals 293.15 Kelvin.
