c) A diagram is drawn:
- The diagram is a rectangle labeled "KF1" on the left side and "KF2" on the right side. There are arrows pointing into the rectangle from the top labeled "w" and from the left labeled "KF1". There is an arrow pointing out of the rectangle from the bottom labeled "wz" and from the right labeled "KF2". Inside the rectangle, it is labeled "293.12 K" on the left side and "100 degrees Celsius" on the right side.

The equation for the residual entropy generation rate is:
S dot subscript rez equals Q dot subscript aus divided by 323.75 Kelvin minus Q dot subscript aus divided by 293.12 Kelvin equals 65 kilowatts.

This equals 0.047 kilowatts per Kelvin equals 47.72 kilowatts per Kelvin.
