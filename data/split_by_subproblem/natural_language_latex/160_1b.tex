The average temperature T-bar is given by the integral of temperature T with respect to s from s_e to s_a, divided by the difference s_a minus s_e.

The fraction q over T equals s, which implies that T equals q divided by s.

This equals Q-dot-out times the natural logarithm of the fraction s_a over s_e, divided by s_a minus s_e.

The difference s_a minus s_e equals the integral from T_1 to T_3 of c_i times the reciprocal of T with respect to T, which simplifies to c_i times the natural logarithm of the fraction T_2 over T_1.

This equals Q-dot-out times the natural logarithm of the fraction s_a over s_e, divided by c_i times the natural logarithm of the fraction T_2 over T_1.
