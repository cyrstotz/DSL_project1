Instead of FP: Entropy balance:

The equation zero equals the mass flow rate of water (m dot subscript H2O) times (u subscript in minus u subscript out) plus Q dot over T plus s dot subscript erf.

s dot subscript erf equals the mass flow rate of water (m dot subscript H2O) times (u subscript out minus u subscript in) plus Q dot over 295.
