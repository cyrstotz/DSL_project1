The description includes two graphs, both labeled as T-s diagrams:

1. In Graph 1:
   - The x-axis is labeled 's' and the y-axis is labeled 'T'.
   - Several lines are drawn on the graph:
     - A line starts from point O and moves upwards to the right, labeled '1_3'.
     - A line starts from point '1_3' and continues upwards to the right, labeled '1'.
     - A line starts from point '1' and continues upwards to the right, labeled '2'.
     - A line starts from point O and moves upwards to the left, labeled '2_3'.
     - A line starts from point '2_3' and continues upwards to the left, labeled '2_k'.
     - A line starts from point '2_k' and continues upwards to the left, labeled '2'.
     - Several isochore lines are drawn parallel to each other, labeled "isochore".
     - A line labeled '0.13 bar' is drawn parallel to the isochore lines.

2. In Graph 2:
   - The x-axis is labeled 's' and the y-axis is labeled 'T'.
   - Several lines are drawn on the graph:
     - A line starts from point O and moves upwards to the right, labeled '1_3'.
     - A line starts from point '1_3' and continues upwards to the right, labeled '1'.
     - A line starts from point '1' and continues upwards to the right, labeled '2'.
     - A line starts from point O and moves upwards to the left, labeled '2_3'.
     - A line starts from point '2_3' and continues upwards to the left, labeled '2_k'.
     - A line starts from point '2_k' and continues upwards to the left, labeled '2'.
     - Several isochore lines are drawn parallel to each other, labeled "isochore".
     - A line labeled '0.019 bar' is drawn parallel to the isochore lines.
