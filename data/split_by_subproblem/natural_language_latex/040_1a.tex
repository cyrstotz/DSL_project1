1. Heat balance on the cooling jacket:

The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times the rate of change of temperature with respect to time, which equals the rate of heat transfer out, denoted as Q dot out.

Q dot out equals the specific heat capacity times the mass flow rate times the change in temperature, which is equal to Q dot out, and Q dot out equals the specific heat capacity times the mass flow rate times 10 Kelvin.

1. Heat balance around the boiler:

Zero equals the mass flow rate in times the difference in enthalpy in minus enthalpy out plus the rate of heat added minus the rate of heat transferred out.

The enthalpy in (from Table 1c) is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy out (from Table 1d) is 949.07 kilojoules per kilogram.

Q dot out equals the mass flow rate in times the difference in enthalpy in minus enthalpy out plus the rate of heat added, which equals 62.2 kilowatts.
