The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled T in Kelvin and the horizontal axis labeled s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph contains a series of points connected by lines, forming a cycle. The points are labeled as follows:
- Point 1 is at the origin.
- Point 2 is above and to the right of Point 1.
- Point 3 is above and to the right of Point 2.
- Point 4 is to the right of Point 3.
- Point 5 is below and to the right of Point 4.
- Point 6 is below and to the left of Point 5.
- Point 7 is below and to the left of Point 6, and directly below Point 2.
The points are connected in the following order: from Point 1 to Point 2, from Point 2 to Point 3, from Point 3 to Point 4, from Point 4 to Point 5, from Point 5 to Point 6, from Point 6 to Point 7, and from Point 7 back to Point 1.
