The average temperature T-bar is equal to the integral from a to b of T-bar ds divided by S-a minus S-c. This equals the integral of dH divided by S-a minus S-c, assuming constant pressure. This simplifies to h-a minus h-a divided by S-a minus S-c, which equals the integral of c-p dT divided by the integral of c-p over T dT. This further simplifies to c-p times T-2 minus T-1 divided by c-p times the natural logarithm of T-2 over T-1, resulting in 253.12 Kelvin.
