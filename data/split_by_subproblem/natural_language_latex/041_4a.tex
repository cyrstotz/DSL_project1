- The first graph is a pressure (p) versus temperature (T) diagram. The p-axis is vertical and the T-axis is horizontal. The graph displays a complex curve with multiple peaks and valleys, and a straight line intersects the curve.
- The second graph is also a pressure (p) versus temperature (T) diagram. The p-axis is vertical and the T-axis is horizontal. The graph shows three distinct regions labeled "solid," "liquid," and "gas." There is a point labeled T_P on the curve separating the solid and liquid regions, and another point labeled T_i on the curve separating the liquid and gas regions.
