In the first equation, for a duration of 25 seconds, the rate of heat transfer, denoted as Q-dot EF, per unit temperature T EF, increases to 65 kilowatts. Below this, the term "Wand" is mentioned, followed by an arrow pointing downwards, indicating a temperature T R of 373.15 Kelvin and a heat transfer of 65 kilowatts.

In the second equation, the generated entropy rate, denoted as S-dot erz, is equal to zero.

In the third equation, the sum of zero plus the fraction of 65 kilowatts over 373.15 Kelvin minus the fraction of 65 kilowatts over 298 Kelvin plus the generated entropy rate S-dot erz equals zero.

Under the section titled "Entropy balance around the wall," the generated entropy rate S-dot erz is given as 0.04675 kilowatts per Kelvin, which is equivalent to 46.15 watts per Kelvin.
