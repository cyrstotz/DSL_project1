d) The heat transfer \( Q_{k2} \) is equal to 1500 Joules, which implies \( Q_{k2}^{eis} \) equals mass times 1500 Joules.

For \( x_{eis,2} \):

The internal energy \( u_2^{eis} \) is equal to the internal energy at the liquid phase \( u_f \) plus \( x_{eis,2} \) times the difference between the internal energy at the gas phase \( u_g \) and \( u_f \), at the pressure \( p_{eis} \).

The pressure \( p_{eis} \) is equal to 1 bar plus the product of \( m_u \) and \( j \) divided by \( t \), which equals 1.3996 \( j \) bar, approximately 1.4 bar.

The internal energy \( u_2^{eis} \) is defined by the energy balance around EW:

The mass of ice \( m_{eis} \) times the difference in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 plus \( Q_{k2}^{eis} \) minus the work \( W_v^{eis} \) equals zero, assuming incompressibility.

The internal energy at state 2 for ice \( U_2^{eis} \) is equal to the negative ratio of \( Q_{k2}^{eis} \) to \( m_{eis} \) plus \( U_1 \).

The internal energy \( u_2^{eis} \) is equal to \( u_f \) plus \( x_{eis} \) times the difference between \( u_g \) and \( u_f \) at 1.4 bar.

The internal energy \( u_2^{eis} \) is equal to -200.032 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy \( u_2^{eis} \) is equal to -245.098 kilojoules per kilogram.

The value \( x_{eis,2} \) is calculated as the ratio of \( u_2^{eis} - u_f \) to \( u_g - u_f \), which equals 0.355, indicating a phase that is part liquid and part solid.
