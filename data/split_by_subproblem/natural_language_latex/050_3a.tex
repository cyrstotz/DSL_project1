The variables are \( p_{gz1} \) and \( m_g \).

The equation \( p_{gz1} \cdot A = m_g g + m_{ew} \cdot g \frac{h_{amb}}{A} \) is given.

The expression for \( p_{gz1} \) is \( p_{gz1} = \frac{1}{A} (m_g + m_{ew} \cdot g) + p_{amb} \).

It simplifies to \( 110003.6 \, \frac{N}{m^2} \).

The mass \( m \) is calculated using the formula \( m = \frac{p V}{R T} \) and results in \( 0.0027 \, \text{kg} \).

The area \( A \) is calculated as \( A = \pi \cdot 0.1^2 \).

The ambient pressure \( p_{amb} \) is \( 100000 \, \frac{N}{m^2} \).

The temperature \( T \) is \( 273.15 \, K \).

The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as \( R = \frac{8.314}{50} = 0.16628 \, \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \) and is also expressed as \( 166.28 \, \frac{J}{kg \cdot K} \).

The volume \( V \) is \( 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \, m^3 \).
