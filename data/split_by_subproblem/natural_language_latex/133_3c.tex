The internal energy U_A is negative twenty point zero zero nine two eight kilograms per second.

The sum of U_A and Q_A2 is negative two thousand one hundred nine point fifty-one Joules.

The specific internal energy u_2 is calculated as the sum of U_A2 and Q_A2 divided by mass m, which equals negative two thousand one hundred nine point fifty-one Joules per kilogram.

The equilibrium quality x_2,eq is calculated as the ratio of u_2 minus u_2,liquid to u_FCH minus u_2,liquid, which equals zero point six three two five zero, approximated as zero point six three three.

The specific internal energy u_2,FCH is negative zero point three three two minus three hundred thirty-three point four four two Joules per kilogram.

The specific internal energy u_2,liquid is negative zero point three three two Joules per kilogram.
