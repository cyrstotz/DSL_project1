The fraction of T2 minus T1 over the natural logarithm of T2 over T1 equals the fraction of 238.15 minus 286.15 over the natural logarithm of 258.15 over 291.15, which approximately equals 293.1 Kelvin.

Delta S equals S2 minus S1, which equals m2 times S2 minus m1 times S1.

S2 equals Sf at 30 degrees Celsius, see F, which is 0.8542 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (reference A-2).

S1 equals Sf at 100 degrees Celsius plus x times (Sg at 100 degrees Celsius minus Sf at 100 degrees Celsius), which approximately equals 1.337 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Delta S equals (535 plus 109) times 0.8542 minus 535 times 1.337.

This approximately equals an underline of 209.5 kilojoules per Kelvin.
