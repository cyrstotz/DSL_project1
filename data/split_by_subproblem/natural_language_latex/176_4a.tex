The description is of a graph with the vertical axis labeled as 'p' with units in bars and the horizontal axis labeled as 'T' with units in degrees Celsius. The graph features a line that begins at the origin and increases linearly, labeled as "fast". There is a horizontal line that intersects this linear line at a point labeled 'q1'. From this intersection point, a vertical line labeled 'q2' extends upwards. The region above the linear line is labeled "gas", and the region below is labeled "liquid".
