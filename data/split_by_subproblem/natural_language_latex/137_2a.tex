- A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 's' in units of Joules per kilogram (J/kg) and the y-axis labeled as 'T' in Kelvin (K).
- There are three horizontal lines labeled from bottom to top as \(P_0\), \(P_1\), and \(P_2\).
- A vertical line labeled '2 Compression' intersects the horizontal lines at points labeled \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
- Another vertical line labeled '1 Compression' intersects the horizontal lines at points labeled \(O\), \(B\), and \(C\).
- The region between the two vertical lines is shaded.

Text to the right of the graph reads:
- "Air ideal gas implies no after-combustion"
- "Stricken processes"
- "Work is utilized"
