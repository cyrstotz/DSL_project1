- The text "Statistical process at the compressor" is written.
- The equation zero equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 3) minus the work rate of the turbine is written.
- The text "reversible process:" is written.
- T2 equals T1 times the ratio of pressure at state 2 to pressure at state 1.
- T2 equals 297.75 Kelvin.
- Equals negative 26 degrees Celsius.
- P2 equals 1.0193 bar.
- S3 equals sf at 8 bar plus x times (sg minus sf).
- X equals (s3 minus sf at 8 bar) divided by (sg at 8 bar minus sf at 8 bar).
- Equals 0.983 minus 0.32455.
- Equals 0.3066 minus 0.32455.
