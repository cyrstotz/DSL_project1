The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as temperature in Kelvin. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is directly above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, and point 4 is below point 3 but to the right of point 2. The curve from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isentropic". The curve from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isentropic (reversible)". The curve from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "isentropic". There are multiple horizontal lines from points 1, 3, and 4 to the right, all labeled "isochoric".
