The average temperature T-bar over T-LF is given by the ratio of the integral of T with respect to sigma over the difference between S-out and S-in, which equals the difference between h-out and h-in over the difference between s-out and s-in.

The integral of T with respect to sigma equals q-in. Therefore, the balance equation is q-in equals m-dot times the difference between h-out and h-in.

s-out equals s-SF at 298.15 Kelvin and s-in equals s-F at 288.15 Kelvin.
