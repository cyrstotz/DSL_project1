The specific exergy loss, denoted as e_{x,verl}, is equal to the ratio of the exergy loss rate, dot{E}_{x,verl}, to the total mass flow rate, dot{m}_{ges}. This can be expressed as the product of the reference temperature, T_0, and the entropy generation rate due to losses, dot{S}_{e, verl}.

Entropy balance: The equation states that zero equals the product of the mass flow rate of gas, dot{m}_g, and the entropy at state zero, s_0, minus the product of the mass flow rate of the compressor, dot{m}_k, and the entropy at state six, s_6, plus the ratio of the heat transfer rate, dot{Q}, to the reference temperature, T_0, plus the entropy generation rate due to losses, dot{S}_{e, verl}.

The entropy generation rate due to losses, dot{S}_{e, verl}, is equal to the product of the ratio of the mass flow rate of gas, dot{m}_g, to the total mass flow rate, dot{m}_{ges}, and the entropy at state zero, s_0, minus the entropy at state zero, s_0.

Mass flow balance at the compressor: The equation states that the product of the mass flow rate of gas, dot{m}_g, and the difference in enthalpy between state zero, h_0, and the non-shaft state, h_{ns}, equals the product of the mass flow rate of the compressor, dot{m}_k, and the difference in enthalpy between state zero, h_0, and state one, h_1.

This leads to the isentropic efficiency, eta_{ns}, being equal to the ratio of the difference in enthalpy between state zero, h_0, and the non-shaft state, h_{ns}, to the difference in enthalpy between state zero, h_0, and state one, h_1. This ratio is also equal to the ratio of the mass flow rate of gas, dot{m}_g, to the mass flow rate of the compressor, dot{m}_k.
