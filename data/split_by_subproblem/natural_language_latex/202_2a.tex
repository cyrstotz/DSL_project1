The content describes a graph of T versus s with specific details:
1. The graph includes four curves labeled as follows:
   - A curve labeled "isotherm" which is relatively flat.
   - A curve labeled "isobar" which is steeper than the isotherm.
   - A curve labeled "isentrop" which is the steepest.
   - A curve labeled "1-2" which starts at point 1 and ends at point 2.
2. The points on the graph are connected in the following manner:
   - Point 1 to Point 2 along the isentrop curve.
   - Point 2 to Point 3 along the isobar curve.
   - Point 3 to Point 4 along the isotherm curve.
   - Point 4 to Point 5 along another isobar curve.
3. The graph has axes labeled T in Kelvin and s.

Additionally, there is an equation:
The relative average energy, denoted as E_rel bar, equals negative E_x,st plus the product of gamma minus the ratio of T_0 over T_B, multiplied by q_B. This is calculated as 100 plus the product of 1 minus the ratio of 293.15 over 273.15, multiplied by 1.35, minus 869.7 divided by 9.
