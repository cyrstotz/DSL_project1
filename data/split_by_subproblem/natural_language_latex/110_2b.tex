The equations are as follows:

1. What are the values of \( w_c \) and \( T_6 \)?

2. The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum of the mass flow rate entering times the sum of the enthalpy entering and half the square of the velocity entering, minus the sum of the mass flow rate exiting times the sum of the enthalpy exiting and half the square of the velocity exiting.

3. The expression \( 5-6 \).

4. Zero equals the sum of the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 5 and state 6 plus half the difference of the squares of the velocities at state 5 and state 6.

5. Zero equals the difference in enthalpy between state 5 and state 6 plus half the difference of the squares of the velocities at state 5 and state 6.

6. Twice the difference in enthalpy between state 6 and state 5 equals the difference of the squares of the velocities at state 5 and state 6.

7. Twice the specific heat capacity of gas times the difference in temperature between state 6 and state 5 equals the difference of the squares of the velocities at state 5 and state 6.

8. The ratio of temperature at state 6 to state 5 equals the ratio of pressure at the initial state to pressure at state 5 raised to the power of \( \frac{n-1}{n} \) where \( n = 1.4 \).

9. The temperature at state 6 equals the temperature at state 5 times the ratio of \( 0.1 \times 9.1 \) bar over \( 0.5 \) bar raised to the power of \( \frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4} \), which equals 431.9 Kelvin times \( \frac{1.4}{1.4} \), resulting in \( 328.0747 \) Kelvin.

10. Twice the specific heat capacity of gas in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference in temperature between 328.0747 Kelvin and 431.9 Kelvin minus 220 square meters per second squared equals negative 4829 square meters per second squared.

11. Twice the specific heat capacity of gas times the difference in temperature between 328.0747 Kelvin and 431.9 Kelvin minus 220 square meters per second squared equals negative 2572.96 square meters per second squared, which equals the difference of the squares of the velocities at state 6 and state 5.

12. The velocity at state 6 equals approximately \( 50.7244 \) meters per second.
