The equations are as follows:

1. Epsilon subscript k equals the reciprocal of the absolute value of Q subscript e divided by W subscript k.

2. a equals the rate of heat transfer Q subscript k dot divided by W subscript k, which equals the fraction of u times k times g over 3600 seconds times the difference of h subscript 7 minus h subscript 1, all divided by 0.028, resulting in approximately 6.587.

3. Q subscript e equals the rate of mass flow dot m times the difference of h subscript 2 minus h subscript 1.

4. h subscript 2 equals the average of 258.36 and 260.47 kilojoules per kilogram, which results in 259.41 kilojoules per kilogram.
