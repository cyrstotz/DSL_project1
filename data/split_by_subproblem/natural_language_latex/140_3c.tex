For item 3c, the variable \( Q_{12} \) is defined.

The change in energy \( \Delta E \) is equal to \( m_g \) times the difference \( (u_2 - u_1) \), which equals negative \( Q_{12} \).

This is further elaborated as \( m_g c_v (T_2 - T_1) \) which also equals negative \( Q_{12} \).

The value of \( Q_{12} \) is calculated as negative \( m_d c_v (T_2 - T_1) \), which results in \( 1674.3 \) Joules.

It is noted that \( T_2 \) equals \( 0.003 \) degrees Celsius.
