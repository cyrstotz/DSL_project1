The graph is described as a phase diagram with the x-axis labeled as 'T [K]' (temperature in Kelvin) and the y-axis labeled as 'p [bar]' (pressure in bar). The graph displays a curve that begins at the origin and ascends upwards, representing the phase boundary between solid and vapor. The area below the curve is labeled "Dampf" which translates to "vapor", and the area above the curve is labeled "Solid + Dampf" which translates to "solid + vapor". There is a point on the curve labeled "Tripel" which translates to "triple point".
