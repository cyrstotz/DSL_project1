The graph is a Temperature (T) versus Entropy (S) diagram. The y-axis is labeled as T in Kelvin. The x-axis is labeled as S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. There are six points labeled from 1 through 6. The process from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "adiabat". The process from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "adiabat, reversible". The process from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "adiabat". The process from point 4 to point 5 is labeled as "adiabat, reversible". The process from point 5 to point 6 is labeled as "adiabat". The process from point 6 to point 1 is labeled as "adiabat, reversible". The pressure at point 4 is labeled as 0.5 bar. The pressure at point 6 is labeled as 0.1 bar.
