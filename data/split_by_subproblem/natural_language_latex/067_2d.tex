The expressions are as follows:

d) The exergy associated with heat transfer at constant pressure, denoted as \( e_{x,Q} \), is equal to \( \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) \) times \( Q \), which equals 369.58 kilojoules per kilogram.

e) The exergy associated with the process, denoted as \( e_{x,\text{verd}} \), is equal to the negative change in exergy associated with superheating, denoted as \( - \Delta e_{x,\text{sh}} \), plus the exergy associated with heat transfer at constant pressure, \( e_{x,Q} \), which equals 848.69 kilojoules per kilogram.
