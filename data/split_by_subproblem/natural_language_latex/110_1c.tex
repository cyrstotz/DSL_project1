The item c) contains the following equations:

1. The rate of change of entropy, denoted as S with a dot above it and subscript 'rez', is questioned, represented as:
   \[
   \dot{S}_{\text{rez}} = ?
   \]

2. The equation given is:
   \[
   \frac{dS}{dt} = 0 = \dot{m} \left[ s_e - s_a \right] T + \sum \frac{\dot{Q}_j}{T_j} + \dot{s}_{\text{rez}}
   \]
   This translates to: the derivative of S with respect to t equals zero, which is equal to the mass flow rate (denoted as m with a dot above it) times the difference between the entropy at exit (s subscript e) and the entropy at entrance (s subscript a) times the temperature T, plus the sum of the heat transfer rate (Q with a dot above it and subscript j) divided by the temperature (T subscript j), plus the rate of change of entropy (s with a dot above it and subscript 'rez').
