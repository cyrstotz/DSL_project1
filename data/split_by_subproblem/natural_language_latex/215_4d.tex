The expression for the energy efficiency of the cooling circuit, E_K, is given by the ratio of the heat input rate, dot Q_zu, to the work of the cooling circuit, W_K. This is derived from the energy balance around the cooling circuit.

The heat input rate, dot Q_zu, is equal to the mass flow rate, dot m, multiplied by the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 1, expressed as:
28 watts, dot Q_zu equals dot m times (h_2 minus h_1).
