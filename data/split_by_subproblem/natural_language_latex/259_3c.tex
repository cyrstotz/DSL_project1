The equation for \( Q_B \) is given by \( Q_B = E_2 - E_1 = \sum Q_i - \frac{5}{2} W_{trn} \).

The change in internal energy \( m (u_2 - u_1) \) is equal to \( Q_{12} \), which is calculated as the integral from \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \) of \( m c_v^{ig} dT \), simplifying to \( m c_v^{ig} (T_2 - T_1) \), and numerically equals \( 3.6 \times 0.63976 \times (273.153 - 0) \).

The temperature \( T_2 \) is given as \( 0.003^\circ C \), which equals \( 273.153 \, K \).

This results in \( 1.14 \, kJ \).

Finally, \( Q_{12} \) is \( 1140 \, J \).
