The average temperature, denoted as T-bar, is equal to the integral from s-sub-e to s-sub-2 of T ds, divided by the difference s-sub-2 minus s-sub-e, which simplifies to T-sub-2 times s-sub-2 minus T-sub-e times s-sub-e, all over s-sub-2 minus s-sub-e. The values for s-sub-2 and s-sub-e are not provided.
