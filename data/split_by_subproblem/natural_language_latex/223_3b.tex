The pressure \( p_g \) is equal to the product of \( M_g \) and the reciprocal of \( m \) divided by the product of \( V \) and \( \text{Sec}^2 \), plus the product of 32 kg and the reciprocal of \( m \) divided by the product of \( V \) and \( \text{Sec}^2 \), plus 1 bar.

The pressure \( p_{g1} \) is equal to 1 bar plus 0.12 bar plus 50 Joules per kilogram-Kelvin, which equals 1.12 bar.

The mass \( m_{g1} \) is equal to the product of \( R \) and \( T_1 \) divided by the product of \( p_1 \) and \( V_1 \), which is equal to the product of 166.28 reciprocal of kilogram-Kelvin and 773.15 Kelvin divided by the product of 1.15 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals and 0.00314 cubic meters, resulting in 272.
