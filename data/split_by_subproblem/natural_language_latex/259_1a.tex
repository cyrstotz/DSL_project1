Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance plus two times the heat flow rate minus the input work rate at base conditions.

Two times the heat flow rate equals six times the used heat flow rate.

The heat flow rate equals the used heat flow rate.

The used heat flow rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance.

The enthalpy at exit equals 419.04 plus 0.005 times the difference between 2676.1 and 419.04, which results in 430.33 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at entrance equals 292.98 plus 0.005 times the difference between 2626.8 and 292.98, which results in 304.65 kilojoules per kilogram.

The used heat flow rate equals 0.3 times the difference between 304.65 and 430.33 plus 100 kilojoules per kilogram, which results in 62.30 kilowatts.
