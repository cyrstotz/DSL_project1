The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum of the product of mass flow rate and specific enthalpy plus the sum of heat flow rate minus the sum of volume flow rate.

The change in internal energy is equal to the change in mass between state 1 and 2 multiplied by the specific enthalpy at the inlet between state 1 and 2 plus the heat input minus the heat output.

The change in internal energy is equal to the change in mass between state 1 and 2 multiplied by the specific enthalpy at the inlet between state 1 and 2.

The change in mass between state 1 and 2 multiplied by the ratio of the change in internal energy to the specific enthalpy at the inlet between state 1 and 2 equals the sum of the product of mass at state 1 plus the change in mass between state 1 and 2 and specific enthalpy at state 2 divided by the specific enthalpy at the inlet between state 1 and 2 minus the product of mass at state 1 and specific enthalpy at state 1 divided by the specific enthalpy at the inlet between state 1 and 2.

The change in mass between state 1 and 2 minus the change in mass between state 1 and 2 equals the difference of the product of mass at state 1 and specific enthalpy at state 2 divided by the specific enthalpy at the inlet between state 1 and 2 and the product of mass at state 1 and specific enthalpy at state 1 divided by the specific enthalpy at the inlet between state 1 and 2.

The change in mass between state 1 and 2 multiplied by the difference of one and the reciprocal of the specific enthalpy at the inlet between state 1 and 2 equals the ratio of mass at state 1 to the specific enthalpy at the inlet between state 1 and 2 multiplied by the difference of specific enthalpy at state 2 and state 1.

Therefore, the change in mass equals the ratio of mass at state 1 to the specific enthalpy at the inlet between state 1 and 2 multiplied by the difference of specific enthalpy at state 2 and state 1 multiplied by the reciprocal of the difference of one minus the specific enthalpy at the inlet between state 1 and 2.
