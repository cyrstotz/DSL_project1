Entropy balance around the jacket:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy out and the entropy in, plus the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature.

The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy out and the enthalpy in.

The heat transfer rate divided by the temperature equals the integral from the inlet temperature to the outlet temperature of the specific heat capacity times the differential of temperature over temperature, plus the volume flow rate times the difference between the outlet pressure and the inlet pressure divided by the temperature.

The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the specific heat capacity times the difference between the outlet temperature and the inlet temperature.
