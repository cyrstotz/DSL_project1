The ratio of T6 over T5 is equal to the ratio of p6 over p5 raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.

T6 equals T5 times the ratio of p6 over p5 raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n, which equals 937.9 Kelvin times the ratio of 0.757 bar over 0.5 bar raised to the power of (2.9 minus 1) divided by 2.9, resulting in an underlined value of 327.4 Kelvin.
