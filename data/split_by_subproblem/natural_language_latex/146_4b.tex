The rate of change of kinetic energy, W dot subscript K, equals 28 Watts.

The process from state 2 to state 3 is isothermal.

The equation zero equals m dot times the difference of h subscript 2 and h subscript 3 minus W dot subscript K leads to W dot subscript K equals m dot times the difference of h subscript 2 and h subscript 3.

This implies that m dot equals W dot subscript K divided by the difference of h subscript 2 and h subscript 3.

h subscript 2 equals (no value provided).

The pressure at state 3, p subscript 3, equals p bar, and it relates to h subscript 2 and the fraction four fortieths.

The entropy at state 2, S subscript 2, equals the entropy at state 3, S subscript 3 equals (no value provided).
