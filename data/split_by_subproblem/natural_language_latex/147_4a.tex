The text describes a pressure-volume diagram. The y-axis is labeled as "p [bar]" and the x-axis is labeled as "V [cubic meters]". The diagram features a closed loop with four distinct points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the path follows these points in a cyclic manner.

The path description is as follows:
- Starting at point 1, the path moves upwards and to the right, reaching point 2.
- From point 2, the path continues to rise steeply, reaching a peak and then descending to point 3.
- At point 3, the path moves downwards and to the left, reaching point 4.
- Finally, from point 4, the path moves back to point 1, completing the cycle.

The directions of the path are indicated by arrows:
- The arrow from point 1 to point 2 is pointing upwards and to the right.
- The arrow from point 2 to point 3 is pointing downwards and to the right.
- The arrow from point 3 to point 4 is pointing downwards and to the left.
- The arrow from point 4 to point 1 is pointing upwards and to the left.
