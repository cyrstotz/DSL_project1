The average temperature for the process uF is unknown, represented as overline{T}_{uF} equals question mark.

The heat capacity for the process uF is constant, hence the change in internal energy Delta u equals the heat capacity c_{uF} times the change in temperature Delta T.

The change in internal energy Delta U equals the heat transfer rate dot{Q}_R, which is equal to the heat capacity C_{kF} times the difference in temperatures from outside to inside, represented as T_{kF, drau√ü} minus T_{kF, ein}.

From this, the heat capacity C_{kF} is determined to be 6.2294.

The change in entropy Delta S is calculated by integrating from the initial temperature T_{ein} to the final temperature T_{aus} the expression C_{kF} over T with respect to T, assuming an ideal fluid.

This results in the change in entropy Delta S equals C_{kF} times the difference between the natural logarithm of the final temperature and the natural logarithm of the initial temperature, which simplifies to C_{kF} divided by an unspecified denominator times 0.2104.

The system kF is a closed system.

Therefore, the change in entropy Delta S equals the heat transfer rate dot{Q}_R divided by the temperature T_{kF} plus the generated entropy rate dot{S}_{erzeugt} to the power of zero.

Consequently, the temperature T_{kF} equals the external heat transfer rate dot{Q}_R^{ex} divided by the change in entropy Delta S, resulting in 295.123 Kelvin.
