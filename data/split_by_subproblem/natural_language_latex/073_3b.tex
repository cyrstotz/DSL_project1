b) 
No heat flows anymore when all the ice has melted. During this process, the pressure remains the same.

This implies that the temperature \( T_{G2} \) is the same as the temperature of the melting ice.

This implies \( T_{G2} \) equals 0 degrees Celsius.

The pressure of the gas remains the same.
This implies \( P_{G2} \) equals 2.8 bar.
