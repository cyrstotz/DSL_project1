Entropy balance around KF:
The power at KF, \( P_{KF} \), equals the power entering at KF, \( P_{KF,ein} \), which implies an isobaric and reversible process.

The product \( L_p Serz \) equals zero.

The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate of KF, \( \dot{m}_{KF} \), times the difference in entropy at the entry and exit, \( s_e - s_a \), plus the heat flow rate out, \( \dot{Q}_{aus} \), divided by the temperature at KF, \( T_{KF} \), equals the mass flow rate of KF, \( \dot{m}_{KF} \), times the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, \( c_{if} \), times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the entry temperature to the exit temperature, \( \frac{T_e}{T_a} \), minus the heat flow rate out, \( \dot{Q}_{aus} \), divided by the temperature at KF, \( T_{KF} \).

Energy balance around KF:
Zero equals the mass flow rate of KF, \( \dot{m}_{KF} \), times the difference in enthalpy at the entry and exit, \( h_e - h_a \), minus the heat flow rate out, \( \dot{Q}_{aus} \).

This implies that the mass flow rate of KF, \( \dot{m}_{KF} \), equals the heat flow rate out, \( \dot{Q}_{aus} \), divided by the difference in enthalpy at the entry and exit, \( h_e - h_a \), equals the heat flow rate out, \( \dot{Q}_{aus} \), divided by the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, \( c_{if} \), times the difference in temperature at the entry and exit, \( T_e - T_a \), under the condition that the power at KF, \( P_{KF} \), is constant.

Zero equals the heat flow rate out, \( \dot{Q}_{aus} \), divided by the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, \( c_{if} \), times the difference in temperature at the entry and exit, \( T_e - T_a \), times the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, \( c_{if} \), times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the entry temperature to the exit temperature, \( \frac{T_e}{T_a} \), minus the heat flow rate out, \( \dot{Q}_{aus} \), divided by the temperature at KF, \( T_{KF} \).

The ratio of the heat flow rate out, \( \dot{Q}_{aus} \), to the reference heat flow rate, \( \dot{Q}_R \), equals the natural logarithm of the ratio of the entry temperature to the exit temperature, \( \frac{T_e}{T_a} \), divided by the difference in temperature at the entry and exit, \( T_e - T_a \).

The ratio of the heat flow rate out, \( \dot{Q}_{aus} \), to the reference heat flow rate, \( \dot{Q}_R \), equals the reciprocal of the temperature at KF, \( \frac{1}{T_{KF}} \), equals negative 243.12 Kelvin.
