Subsection d) Open-ended System

The change in energy, Delta E, equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the enthalpy at state 2, h2, plus the heat transfer, Q, approaching zero degrees.

The heat transfer, Q, equals the mass flow rate, m dot, times the enthalpy at state 1, h1.

Table A-2

The enthalpy at state x, hx, equals the enthalpy at state 5, h5, plus x times the difference between the enthalpy at state 6, h6, and the enthalpy at state 5, h5, which equals 83.9 kilojoules per kilogram at 20 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy at state a, ha, equals the enthalpy at state 5, h5, plus x times the difference between the enthalpy at state 6, h6, and the enthalpy at state 5, h5, at 70 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy at state a, ha, equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram plus 0.005 times the difference between 2626.8 kilojoules per kilogram and 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at state a, ha, equals 304.6 kilojoules per kilogram.

The change in mass from state 1 to state 2, Delta m12, equals the heat transfer from state 1 to state 2, Q12, divided by the difference between the enthalpy at state a, ha, and the enthalpy at state x, hx, which equals 158.50 kilograms over Delta mx.
