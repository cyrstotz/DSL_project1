The mass flow rate of R134a is calculated as four kilograms per hour divided by 3600 seconds per hour, which equals 0.0011 kilograms per second.

The temperature T2 is minus 22 degrees Celsius.

This implies that the pressure p2 is 1.2122 bar, and p1 is also mentioned but its value is not provided.

The enthalpy h1 is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram, as per Table Task 4.

The quality x is calculated as (h1 minus hf at minus 22 degrees Celsius) divided by (hg at minus 22 degrees Celsius minus hf at minus 22 degrees Celsius), which equals 0.337.

The equation zero equals h1 minus h2 plus the heat transfer rate Qk.

The heat input Qzu equals the heat transfer rate Qk, which is the mass flow rate of R134a times (h2 minus h1), resulting in 160.35 kilowatts.

The electrical work We is 281 watts, questioning if it should be in watts and not kilowatts.

In German, it states that it would cool down as heat is removed from the freezer bag, but this is not sustainable in the long term.
