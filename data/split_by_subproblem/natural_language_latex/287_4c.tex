The temperature T2 is minus 22 degrees Celsius.
The mass flow rate is in kilojoules per hour.
The mass flow rate is 24 kilojoules over n.
24 kilojoules per 3600 seconds equals 0.00667 kilojoules per second.

The temperature T1 is 0 degrees Celsius.
The mixed temperature is minus 6 degrees Celsius.

Setting up the energy equation:
Enthalpy changes from hv1 to hv2.
The initial pressure p01 is 8 bar, leading to hv2 equals hg at 8 bar, which is 93.12 kilojoules per kilogram.
hv2 is 93.12 kilojoules per kilogram.

The temperature TA1 equals TA10.
The temperature T1, which is the evaporator temperature, is 0 degrees Celsius and T2 equals T1 equals T2, which is minus 22 degrees Celsius.

Interpolating hv, hf at minus 6 degrees Celsius equals (44.75 minus 39.51) divided by (minus 6 minus (minus 8)) times 37.51 equals 42.145 kilojoules per kilogram.

hg at minus 6 degrees Celsius equals (214.3 minus 207.5) divided by (minus 6 minus (minus 8)) times 242.5 equals 213.72 kilojoules per kilogram.

hv is 42.145 kilojoules per kilogram.
hg is 213.72 kilojoules per kilogram.

The quality x is calculated as (h minus hf) divided by (hg minus hf) equals 0.231.
