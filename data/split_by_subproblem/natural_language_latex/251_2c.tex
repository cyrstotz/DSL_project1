The change in exergy due to combustion and stream, denoted as Delta e subscript cx comma str, is calculated as follows:
- It starts with the expression h subscript e minus h subscript c4 minus T subscript 0 times the difference s subscript e2 minus s subscript c4 plus Delta ke.
- This expression is repeated.
- It is then expanded to cp times the fraction T subscript e over T subscript 0 minus 1 minus T subscript 0 times the expression cp times the natural logarithm of the fraction T subscript e over T subscript 0 minus R times the natural logarithm of the fraction p subscript e over p subscript 0 plus v subscript e squared over 2 minus w subscript c4 squared over 2.
- The final result of this calculation is 125,471.75 Joules per kilogram, which is equivalent to 125.47 kilojoules per kilogram.
