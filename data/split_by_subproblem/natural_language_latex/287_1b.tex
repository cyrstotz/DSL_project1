b) The average temperature T-bar is equal to the integral of T ds divided by the difference s2 minus s1.

s2 double prime minus s1 double prime equals the integral from T1 to T2 of cig over T dT, which equals cig times the natural logarithm of T2 over T1.

The integral of T ds equals dot H minus V dot p, which is approximately zero, since the pressure is constant.

The integral of T ds equals cig times the integral from T1 to T2 of dT, which equals cig times the difference T2 minus T1.

The average temperature T-bar equals cig times the difference T2 minus T1 divided by cig times the natural logarithm of T2 over T1, which equals 298.15 minus 288.15 divided by the natural logarithm of 298.15 over 288.15, resulting in 293.12 Kelvin.
