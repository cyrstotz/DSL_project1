The rate of change of error for system X in steady state, denoted as e dot subscript X,ST, equals the rate of change of error for system X in steady state control, denoted as e dot subscript X,STC, minus the rate of change of error for system X in steady state operation, denoted as e dot subscript X,STO.

The mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, times the expression (enthalpy of O, h subscript O, minus enthalpy of C, h subscript C, minus the product of the absolute temperature T subscript 0 and the difference in entropy between C and O, s subscript C minus s subscript O, plus h subscript k) equals the crossed out terms e dot subscript X,ST twice.

The mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference in enthalpy between C and O, h subscript C minus h subscript O, equals the specific heat at constant pressure, c subscript p, times the difference in temperature between C and O, T subscript C minus T subscript O, which equals 1.006 times (84.925 minus 85.435).

The difference in entropy between C and O, s subscript C minus s subscript O, equals the specific heat at constant pressure, c subscript p, times the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature O to the absolute temperature T subscript 0, minus the gas constant R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of pressure C to pressure O, which equals 0.301.

The expression equals 85.435 minus 243.75 times 0.301 plus the difference in the squares of velocity C and velocity O, w subscript C squared minus w subscript O squared, all divided by 2, equals e dot subscript X,ST.

The difference in the squares of velocity C and velocity O, w subscript C squared minus w subscript O squared, divided by 2, where w equals 200 meters per second.

This results in 42.887 and 110.062 times the unit (2 times h per kg).
