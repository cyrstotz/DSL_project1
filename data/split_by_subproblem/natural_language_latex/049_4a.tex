The graph is described as a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled T and the y-axis is labeled P. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 forming a closed loop. The path from point 1 to point 2 is a vertical line, from point 2 to point 3 is a horizontal line, from point 3 to point 4 is a vertical line, and from point 4 to point 1 is a horizontal line. The area inside the loop is shaded.
