P remains the same, implying that the same conditions as state 1 are maintained. The expression m_g over A plus some omitted terms follows. It is observed that the volume is smaller; from the gas law it follows that T_2 over T_1 equals the quantity P_2 over P_1 raised to the power of (n-1) over n. Here, n equals c_p over c_v, which equals gamma over n plus c_v, all over c_v, resulting in 1.2627. T_2 equals T_1 times the quantity P_2 over P_1 raised to the power of 0.2627 over 1.2627. T_g2 equals 273.15312.
