p sub s1, followed by some space, m sub g.

The equation p sub 1 times V equals m sub g times R times T.

Thus, with equilibrium condition 1,

p sub amb times A divided by mu sub mg equals p sub g times A.

A equals (0.1 meters) squared times pi equals 0.0314 square meters.

p sub s1 equals 10 to the power of 5 Pascals plus (32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared) divided by 0.0314 square meters.

This equals 1.1 bar.

m sub 1 equals (p sub 1 times V) divided by (R times T sub 1) equals (1.05 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of -3 cubic meters) divided by (0.16 times 10 to the power of 3 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times 773.15 Kelvin) equals 2.77 grams.
