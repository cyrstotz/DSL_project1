The given task is to find \( s_{e2} \).

The equation is:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between \( s_{e2} \) and \( s_{e1} \) plus the heat transfer rate divided by temperature \( T \) plus \( s_{e2} \). This implies that \( s_{e2} \) equals the mass flow rate times the difference between \( s_{a} \) and \( s_{e2} \) minus the heat transfer rate divided by temperature \( T \).

Substituting the values, \( s_{e2} \) equals 0.3 times the difference between 7.35543 and 7.35533 minus 62.18 divided by 293.12, which equals approximately -0.212132 or 0.33 kilojoules per kilogram.

Additionally, \( s_{a} \) at \( T = 0 \) is 7.3553 and \( s_{a} \) at \( T = 1 \) is 7.3543, as per Table A-2.
