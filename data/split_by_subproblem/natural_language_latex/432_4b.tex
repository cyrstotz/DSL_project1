The heat transfer rate, Q, is equal to the mass flow rate of fluid 2, denoted as m-dot subscript 2, times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3, minus the power of the compressor, denoted as W-dot subscript K.

The temperature T1 is negative 10 degrees Celsius.

The temperature T2 is equal to T1 minus 6 Kelvin, which results in negative 16 degrees Celsius.

It implies that the enthalpy at state 2, h2, is equal to the enthalpy at state 3, h3, which is 237.74 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced from Table A.10.

The pressure at state 2, p2, is 1.5748 bar, as referenced from Table A.10.
