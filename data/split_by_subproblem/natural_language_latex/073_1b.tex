The temperature T is given by the integral from initial entropy s_a to final entropy s_e of T ds, which equals the reversible heat q_rev divided by the difference in entropy from initial to final state, s_i minus s_e. This is further equal to the difference in enthalpy from output to input, h_aus minus h_ein, divided by the difference in entropy from output to input, s_aus minus s_ein. This expression simplifies to the function of temperature difference from output to input, f times (T_aus minus T_ein), plus the square of initial velocity v_i squared times the pressure difference from output to input, p_aus minus p_ein, all over s_i times the natural logarithm of the ratio of output temperature T_aus to input temperature T_ein.

This simplifies further to the ratio of the temperature difference from output to input, T_aus minus T_ein, over the natural logarithm of the ratio of output temperature T_aus to input temperature T_ein. Substituting the values, it becomes the difference 298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of the ratio 298.15 Kelvin over 288.15 Kelvin.

This results in a temperature of 293.12 Kelvin.
