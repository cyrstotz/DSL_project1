a) p subscript g1 8 milligrams:

The equation for p subscript g1 is equal to p subscript amb plus the fraction of two times sigma subscript 1 over A subscript g1 times ten to the power of negative five plus the fraction of 0.14 over A subscript g1 times ten to the power of negative five, which equals 1400.1 Pascals.

The area of the cylinder, A subscript Zylinder, equals 0.05 times pi times the average velocity u bar, which equals 0.06285 square meters.

The mass of gas, m subscript g, is canceled out, and n equals the fraction of p subscript g times V subscript g over R times T subscript g, which equals 0.0684 moles.

The volume of gas, V subscript g, equals 3.14 times ten to the power of negative three cubic meters.

The molar mass, M subscript c, equals 50 grams per mole.

The mass of the component, m subscript c, equals n times M subscript c, which equals 3.4194 grams.
