Graph 1: This graph has the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as S in Kelvin per kilogram Kelvin. It includes several curves and points:
- A curve labeled "isobar" starts from point 1 and ends at point 2.
- A curve labeled "isotherm" starts from point 2 and ends at point 3.
- A curve labeled "isobar" starts from point 3 and ends at point 4.
- A curve labeled "isotherm" starts from point 4 and ends at point 5.
- A curve labeled "isobar" starts from point 5 and ends at point 6.
- A curve labeled "isotherm" starts from point 6 and ends at point 1.
- Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the graph.

Graph 2: This graph also has the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as S in Kelvin per kilogram Kelvin. It contains similar features as Graph 1:
- A curve labeled "isobar" starts from point 1 and ends at point 2.
- A curve labeled "isotherm" starts from point 2 and ends at point 3.
- A curve labeled "isobar" starts from point 3 and ends at point 4.
- A curve labeled "isotherm" starts from point 4 and ends at point 5.
- A curve labeled "isobar" starts from point 5 and ends at point 6.
- A curve labeled "isotherm" starts from point 6 and ends at point 1.
- Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the graph.
