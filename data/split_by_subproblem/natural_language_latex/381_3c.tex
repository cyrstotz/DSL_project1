The equations are as follows:

1. The mass of substance 'a' times the difference between \( u_2 \) and \( u_1 \).
2. This is followed by an arrow pointing downwards.
3. \( u \) plus 1500 kilojoules equals \( Q_{zu} \).
4. \( u_1 \) equals the ratio of \( Q_{zu} \) to \( m_{EW} \) plus \( u_2 \).
5. \( u_1 \) equals negative 117.77.
6. This is at 0.003.
7. The ice fraction \( X_{Eis} \) is calculated as the ratio of \( u_1 \) minus the melting energy at 0.003 degrees Celsius to the difference between the solid energy at 0.003 degrees Celsius and the melting energy at 0.003 degrees Celsius.
8. This equals the ratio of negative 0.033 kilojoules to 333.462.
