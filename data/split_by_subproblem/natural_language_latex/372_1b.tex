The average temperature T-bar is equal to the integral from T-zero to T-a of c-i divided by T dT, all over the integral from T-zero to T-a of c-i dT.

The temperature T-a, out is equal to 25 degrees Celsius.

The temperature T-e, in is equal to 15 degrees Celsius.

The difference between s-a and s-e is equal to the integral from T-zero to T-a of c-i divided by T dT, which is equal to c-i times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T-a, out to T-e, in.
