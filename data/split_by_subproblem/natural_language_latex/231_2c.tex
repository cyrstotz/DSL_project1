The negative change in the rate of exergy destruction for the system is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between points c and a minus the product of the ambient temperature and the difference in entropy between points e and a, plus half the difference between the square of the exit velocity and the square of the approach velocity.

The negative ratio of the change in the rate of exergy destruction to the mass flow rate is equal to the enthalpy at 300 Kelvin minus the enthalpy at 340 Kelvin minus the product of the ambient temperature and the natural logarithm of the ratio of the ambient temperature to itself, plus half the difference between the square of the exit velocity and the square of the approach velocity.

The enthalpy at 293.15 Kelvin is equal to the enthalpy at 240 Kelvin plus the ratio of the difference between 293.15 Kelvin and 240 Kelvin to the difference between 250 Kelvin and the enthalpy at 240 Kelvin.

The enthalpy at 340 Kelvin is 340.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at 293.15 Kelvin is 243.15 kilojoules per kilogram.

The negative ratio of the change in the rate of exergy destruction to the mass flow rate is equal to 243.15 kilojoules per kilogram minus 340.42 kilojoules per kilogram plus half the difference between 200 square meters per second squared and 510 square meters per second squared.

The ratio of the change in the rate of exergy destruction to the mass flow rate is 11 times 229.27 kilojoules per kilogram.
