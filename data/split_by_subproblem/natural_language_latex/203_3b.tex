Since the mass above the membrane remains the same, the pressure below must also remain the same, implying that p_a1 equals p_a2 equals 1.401 bar.

First law of thermodynamics applied to the cylinder:

The change in energy, Delta E, equals heat added, Q, minus work done, W, which equals the change in internal energy, Delta U.

The work done on the cylinder, W_Z, is the integral from V_1 to V_2 of p_1 times dv, which equals p_1 times (V_2 minus V_1), which equals U_1 minus U_2, which equals c_v times (T_1 minus T_2).
