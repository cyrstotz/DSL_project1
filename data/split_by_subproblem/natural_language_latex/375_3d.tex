The change in internal energy, denoted as Delta U, equals Q12, where "Hier Pos wird aufgef√ºhrt" translates to "Here Pos is listed".

The equation involving masses and energies is given by:
mass of E2 times the remaining specific internal energy plus mass of u2 times the flow energy minus mass of u1 times the remaining specific internal energy minus mass of u1 times the potential energy equals 1.0848 kilojoules.

For the equation involving x:
x minus the ratio of mass of u to mass of w equals 0.6, where the mass of u is 0.1 kilograms.

This implies that the mass of E1 equals 0.06 kilograms.
