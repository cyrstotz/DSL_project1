The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the sum over i of the mass flow rate of i times the quantity of the enthalpy of i plus half the square of the velocity of i plus half the product of gravitational acceleration, the height of i, minus the rate of heat transfer and the rate of work done by the system.

The change in internal energy is equal to the change in mass between state 1 and 2 times the enthalpy of entry plus the rate of heat transfer.

The product of mass at state 2 and internal energy at state 2 minus the product of mass at state 1 and internal energy at state 1 equals the change in mass between state 1 and 2 times the enthalpy of entry plus the rate of heat transfer, with mass at state 2 being equal to mass at state 1 plus the change in mass between state 1 and 2.

The product of the sum of mass at state 1 and the change in mass between state 1 and 2 times internal energy at state 2 minus the product of mass at state 1 and internal energy at state 1 equals the change in mass between state 1 and 2 times the enthalpy of entry plus the rate of heat transfer.

Negative rate of heat transfer plus the product of mass at state 1 and internal energy at state 2 minus the product of mass at state 1 and internal energy at state 1 equals the change in mass between state 1 and 2 times the enthalpy of entry minus the product of mass at state 1 and internal energy at state 2 minus the product of the change in mass between state 1 and 2 and internal energy at state 2.

Negative rate of heat transfer plus the product of mass at state 1 and the difference between internal energy at state 2 and state 1 equals the change in mass between state 1 and 2 times the enthalpy of entry minus the product of the change in mass between state 1 and 2 and internal energy at state 2.

Negative rate of heat transfer plus the product of mass at state 1 and the difference between internal energy at state 2 and state 1 equals the product of the change in mass between state 1 and 2 and the difference between the enthalpy of entry and internal energy at state 2.

The change in mass between state 1 and 2 is equal to the quotient of the difference between the product of mass at state 1 and the difference between internal energy at state 2 and state 1 minus the rate of heat transfer and the difference between the enthalpy of entry and internal energy at state 2.

For boiling liquid with lambda equals 0.5:

The enthalpy of entry is calculated as 83.96 plus 0.5 times the difference between 2538.1 and 83.96, resulting in 1311.03 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy at state 1 is calculated as 418.94 plus 0.005 times the difference between 2506.5 and 418.94, resulting in 429.3778 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy at state 2 is calculated as 292.35 plus 0.5 times the difference between 2463.6 and 292.35, resulting in 1381.275 kilojoules per kilogram.

The change in mass between state 1 and 2 is calculated as the quotient of 5755 kilograms times the difference between 1381.275 kilojoules per kilogram and 429.3778 kilojoules per kilogram plus 35 kilojoules per second and the difference between 1311.03 kilojoules per kilogram and 1381.275 kilojoules per kilogram.
