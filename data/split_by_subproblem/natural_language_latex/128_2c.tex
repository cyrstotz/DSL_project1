The equations provided are as follows:

1. The mass flow rate of G1 times the difference between u2 and u1 equals the heat flow rate into the system minus the work done, expressed as:
   m subscript G1 times (u2 minus u1) equals Q dot subscript zu minus W dot.

2. The equation labeled d1 states that the mass of ice times gravity plus the initial pressure times the area plus the mass moment of ice equals the pressure at state 02 times the area, expressed as:
   m subscript eis times g plus p0 times A plus M subscript eis equals p subscript 02 times A.

3. The ratio of the difference between U2 evaluated at p2,1 and T_EIN and U_E evaluated at p2,1 and T_CWW to the difference between U3 evaluated at p2,1 and T_EIN and U_E evaluated at p2,1 and T_EWW equals X subscript zeis, expressed as:
   (U2 of (p subscript 2,1, T_EIN) minus U_E of (p subscript 2,1, T_CWW)) divided by (U3 of (p subscript 2,1, T_EIN) minus U_E of (p subscript 2,1, T_EWW)) equals X subscript zeis.
