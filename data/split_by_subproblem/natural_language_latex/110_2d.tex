The equations given in the problem are as follows:

1. The mass flow rate times the exit velocity is equal to what?
2. The rate of change of energy times velocity equals the initial temperature times the rate of entropy change times z times the mass flow rate divided by the molecular mass.
3. The exit velocity equals the initial temperature times the rate of entropy change times z.
4. The rate of heat transfer Q with subscript B equals the rate of change of c with subscript B divided by the mass flow rate with subscript e.
5. The ratio of the mass flow rate with subscript M to the mass flow rate with subscript e equals 5.293, and the ratio of the mass flow rate with subscript u to the mass flow rate with subscript e equals 5.293 times the mass flow rate with subscript e.
6. The sum of the mass flow rate with subscript M and the mass flow rate with subscript e equals the total mass flow rate.
7. The mass flow rate with subscript e equals the total mass flow rate times the fraction (5.293 plus 1) divided by the mass flow rate with subscript e.
