In the problem, the values for \( w_G \) and \( T_G \) are given as 5 kg per kg and 394 Kelvin respectively.

The term "mixture" is mentioned, followed by the expression for \( \Delta ex_{str} \), which is the change in exergy due to mixing, calculated as \( ex_{str,G} \) minus \( ex_{str,0} \).

The change in exergy due to mixing, \( \Delta ex_{str} \), is further detailed as:
\[ 
\Delta ex_{str} = \dot{m} \left[ h_G - h_0 - T_0 (s_G - s_0) + (w_G - w_0) \right] + \left( \frac{}{} \right)
\]
However, the last term in the equation is left empty.

The expression is then simplified to:
\[ 
\Delta ex_{str} = cp (T_G - T_0) - T_0 \left( cp \ln \left( \frac{T_G}{T_0} \right) + w_G - w_0 \right)
\]

Finally, the result of \( \Delta ex_{str} \) is given as 335.42 kJ per kg, with some text scribbled out that is not readable.
