mass equals u_fg over h, and T_2 equals negative 22 degrees Celsius.
p_s equals p_u.
Q dot equals zero at Prandl.
q corresponds to 1 in the Energy Balance.
The derivative of E_K dot with respect to time equals m dot times (h_u minus h_a) plus the derivative with respect to time of (c over 2).
h_u plus h_f equals A minus 1 for solids.
h_f equals 53.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
Pressure: h_u plus h_a.
h_a as a function of T and p, establish T and p_s according to.
x plus h_f equals h_f plus h times (h_a minus h_f) over (h_s minus h_f).
