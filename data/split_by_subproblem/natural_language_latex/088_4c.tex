Throttle adiabatic implies isenthalpic.

The enthalpy at state 4 equals the enthalpy at state 1.

Isobaric process implies the pressure at state 4 equals the pressure at state 3, which is 8 bar.

The enthalpy at state 4 is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

Isobaric process implies the pressure at state 1 equals the pressure at state 2, which is 3.3765 bar.

We take A10 at 4 degrees Celsius with a pressure of 3.3765 bar:

x equals (enthalpy at state 4 minus enthalpy at state 1) divided by (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 1), which equals 0.156.
