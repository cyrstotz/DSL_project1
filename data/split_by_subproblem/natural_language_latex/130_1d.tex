The change in internal energy, denoted as Delta U, is equal to the change in mass, denoted as Delta m, multiplied by the difference between h1 and h2, plus Q12 minus Q12. Simplifying this, Delta U equals Delta m times the difference between h1 and h2.

With the following equation:
(m1 plus Delta m) times T2 times ce minus m1 times Ta times cp equals Delta m times (h1 minus h2).

Simplifying further:
m1 times T2 times cp minus m1 times Ta times c equals Delta m times (h1 minus h2) minus T2 times c.

Solving for Delta m, we get:
Delta m equals (m1 times T2 minus m1 times Ta times c) divided by ((h1 minus h2) minus T2 times c).

h1 and h2 are given as constants, and T_AB A-2 is mentioned.

The terms are combined and Delta m is solved.
