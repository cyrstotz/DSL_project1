The average temperature T-bar with subscript KF is given by the equation:

T-bar with subscript KF equals the integral from a to e of T ds divided by s-a minus s-e, which equals the integral from a to e of dh minus V dp over T divided by s-a minus s-e, which simplifies to h-a minus h-e divided by s-a minus s-e, and further simplifies to T-a minus T-e divided by the natural logarithm of T-a over T-e.

In a numerical example, T-bar with subscript KF equals 10 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of 298.95 over 238.45, which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
