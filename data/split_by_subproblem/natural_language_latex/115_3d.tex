The content in natural language is as follows:

- The pressure \( p_{\text{ew}} \) is equal to 758 times 969.54 Pascals times 7.4 centimeters.
- The change in velocity \( \Delta u_{\text{fix}} \) is equal to the absolute value of \( u_{2} \), a small change in velocity \( \Delta u \) in system S minus the fixed frequency.
- It implies that \( \Delta u \) is equal to a constant \( C \) times the rate of change of \( u \) with respect to time \( t \), which implies that \( u_{2} \) is equal to \( \Delta u \) divided by \( m \) plus \( u_{1} \).
- The change in internal energy \( \Delta u \) is 7500 Joules.

Conversion 1:
- The total internal energy \( u_{\text{ges}} \) plus 0.6 times the difference of \( u_{\text{ges}} \) from itself is equal to 33.458 plus 0.6 times negative 33.458.
- This results in negative 0.045 plus 0.6 times the sum of negative 0.045 and 33.458, which equals negative 200.0568 hours per second plus \( u_{1} \).
- \( u_{2} \) is equal to 7500 Joules divided by 6.714 plus negative 200.0568 hours per second, resulting in negative 3000.852 Joules per second.
- This result is noted as not possible ("kann nicht sein" translates to "cannot be").

2d:
- \( u_{2} \) is equal to the difference between \( u_{2} \) and \( u_{\text{klein}} \) divided by the difference between \( u_{\text{ges}} \) and \( u_{\text{klein}} \).
