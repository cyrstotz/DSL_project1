# S-Balance on the cooling fluid side at the cooling wall:
0 equals the rate of heat output plus the rate of heat output divided by temperature T plus the generated entropy rate.
This implies that the generated entropy rate equals the rate of heat output times the difference between one over temperature T and one over the temperature of Reactor 1.
This results in the generated entropy rate being 0.1908 kilowatts per Kelvin.

Graphical Description:
There is a diagram on the right side of the page. The diagram consists of a rectangle labeled "Wall". The rectangle is divided into two halves by a vertical line. The left half is labeled "Reactor Side" and the right half is labeled "Cooling Fluid Side".

There are two arrows pointing outwards from the center of the rectangle, one pointing to the left and labeled with the rate of heat output, and one pointing to the right and labeled with the rate of heat output.

Additionally, there is a note below the diagram stating:
The rate of heat output equals 737.878 kilowatts.
