c) Consider the heat flow out, denoted as Q dot out.

There is a horizontal line labeled "Mantel" with a vertical line intersecting it labeled "System". To the right of the vertical line, there is a dashed box labeled "Reaktor".

The rate of change of entropy, S, with respect to time, t, is given by the equation:
dS/dt equals Q dot divided by the average temperature, T bar, plus the social entropy production rate, S dot social.

Q dot equals negative 62.3 kilowatts.
The average temperature, T bar, equals 293.12 Kelvin.
The social entropy production rate, S dot social, equals 0.213 kilowatts per Kelvin.
