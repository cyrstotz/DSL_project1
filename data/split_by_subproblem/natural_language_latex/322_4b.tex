- Measurements of the refrigerant
- Energy balance for the compressor
- The sum of mass flow rate times (enthalpy plus half the velocity squared plus gravitational acceleration times height) at the inlet equals the sum of mass flow rate times (enthalpy plus half the velocity squared plus gravitational acceleration times height) at the exit plus the current heat transfer rate minus the sum of work done at the exit.
- The heat transfer rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3 minus the work done at the exit.
- The mass flow rate equals the volumetric flow rate divided by the specific volume at state 1.
- The enthalpy at state 2 is a function of the pressure at the compressor outlet.
- Temperature at state i.
- The enthalpy at state 4 equals the fluid enthalpy at the valve pressure, which is 75.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The current heat transfer rate equals the compressed heat transfer rate.
- The entropy at state 2 equals the entropy at state 3.
- Pressures at state 2 and state 1.
- Energy balance around the throttle.
- The heat transfer rate equals the current mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 4 and state 3.
- The enthalpy at state 4 equals the enthalpy at state 3.
