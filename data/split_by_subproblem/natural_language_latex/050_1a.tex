The subsection is titled "Q dot aus."

The expression is:
Q dot aus.

Two diagrams are described:
1. The first diagram is a rectangle labeled "KF1" on the left side and "KF2" on the right side. There are arrows entering the rectangle from the top labeled "1, w" and from the left labeled "KF1". There are arrows exiting the rectangle from the bottom labeled "2, w" and from the right labeled "KF2".
2. The second diagram is a rectangle with arrows entering from the left labeled "h_aw" and from the right labeled "h_zw". There are arrows exiting the rectangle from the top labeled "Q dot aus" and from the bottom labeled "KF2".

The equation is:
The rate of change of energy with respect to time equals zero, which is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between h_aw and h_zw, plus Q dot aus.

The expressions are:
h_aw at 70 degrees Celsius, where x equals 1.
h_zw at 200 degrees Celsius, where x equals 1.

The final equation is:
Q dot aus equals the mass flow rate times the difference between h_zw and h_aw.
