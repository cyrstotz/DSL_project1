d) stationary implies zero equals the mass flow rate times the quantity (h1 minus h2 plus half of c1 squared minus half of c2 squared) plus heat input rate minus heat output rate minus work. The heat output rate equals the heat input rate minus Q out, which is 700,000 watts plus 65,000 watts equals 35,000 watts. The mass flow rate equals (h1 minus h2) divided by (h1 minus h2).
