The section starts with a simplified scenario:

A diagram is presented showing a container with a piston on top. The piston is labeled with the force due to gravity acting on the mass of the piston and additional equipment, expressed as \((m_k + m_{EV}) \cdot g\), and the area below the piston is labeled with \(V_1\).

The specific gas constant \(R\) is calculated as:
\[ R = \frac{R_m}{M_g} = \frac{8.314 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{mol K}}}{50 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{mol}}} = 0.16628 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}} \]

The area of the cylinder \(A_{Zyl}\) or \(A\) is given by:
\[ A = \pi \cdot \frac{D^2}{4} = \pi \cdot 25 \text{cm} = \frac{\pi}{400} \text{m}^2 \]

The force balance equation is:
\[ p_{g,1} \cdot A = (m_k + m_{EV}) \cdot g + p_{amb} \cdot A \]

Solving for \(p_{g,1}\):
\[ p_{g,1} = \frac{g \cdot (m_k + m_{EV}) + p_{amb} \cdot A}{A} \]
\[ = \frac{9.81 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2} \cdot (32 \text{kg}) + 10^5 \text{Pa}}{\frac{\pi}{400} \text{m}^2} = 1.4008 \text{bar} \]

The temperature \(T_{g,1}\) is adjusted from Kelvin to Celsius:
\[ T_{g,1} = 500 \text{K} - 273.15 \text{K} = 273.15 \text{K} \]

The mass of the gas \(m_g\) is calculated using the ideal gas law:
\[ p_{4} \cdot V_1 = m_g \cdot R \cdot T_1 \]
\[ m_g = \frac{p_{1,1} \cdot V_1}{R \cdot T_1} = \frac{140090 \text{Pa} \cdot 3.14 \cdot 10^{-3} \text{m}^3}{0.16628 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}} \cdot 273.15 \text{K}} = 3.422 \text{kg} \]

In the full setting section:

The internal energy \(U_{2,v}\) is calculated using a linear interpolation between two states:
\[ U_{2,v} = U_{1,4\%bar,v} + X_2 \cdot \left( U_{1,fe,1\%bar,v} - U_{1,4\%bar,v} \right) \]
\[ X_2 = \frac{U_{2,v} - U_{1,4\%bar,v}}{U_{1,fe,1\%bar,v} - U_{1,4\%bar,v}} = \frac{600.73 \frac{kJ}{kg} + 0.023 \frac{kJ}{kg}}{-333.438 + 0.045 \frac{kJ}{kg}} \]
\[ = -1.202 \quad \Rightarrow \text{Something is wrong} \]

This indicates an error in the calculation or assumptions.
