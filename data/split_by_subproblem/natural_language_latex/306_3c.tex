1. The first equation states that the difference between E2 and E1 equals Q12 minus the reversible work Wv,rev, which equals negative seven, or the product of mass m, gravitational acceleration g, and the difference in internal energy u2 minus u1 equals Q12.

2. The second equation expresses the reversible work Wv,rev as the integral from v1 to v2 of pressure p with respect to volume v.

3. The third equation states that the product of mass m, gravitational acceleration g, specific heat at constant volume cv, and the difference in temperature T2 minus T1 equals Q12.
