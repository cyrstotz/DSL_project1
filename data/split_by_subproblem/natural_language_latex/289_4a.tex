A graph is drawn on grid paper with the y-axis labeled as p in bar and the x-axis labeled as T in degrees Kelvin. The graph contains a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The path from point 1 to point 2 and from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "isobar". The path from point 2 to point 3 and from point 4 to point 1 is not labeled.
