The content includes three equations related to a problem labeled as "Problem d":

1. The first equation states that the rate of exergy change due to velocity, denoted as \(\dot{e}_{\text{X,vel}}\), is canceled out, and this is related to the exergy balance.

2. The second equation, labeled as "stationary," includes several terms:
   - The rate of exergy change in a stationary state, denoted as \(\dot{e}_{\text{X,ST}}\),
   - The rate of exergy change due to velocity, \(\dot{e}_{\text{X,vel}}\), which is again canceled out,
   - The rate of exergy change due to adiabatic heat transfer, denoted as \(\dot{e}_{\text{Q,adiabat}}\),
   - The rate of work done by the system, denoted as \(\dot{W}_e\).
   The equation equates these terms to the rate of exergy change due to velocity, \(\dot{e}_{\text{X,vel}}\).

3. The third equation is incomplete and only shows the symbol for the rate of work done by the system, \(\dot{W}_e =\), without any further expression or value provided.
