c) The enthalpy \( h_a \) approaches when \( x \) is greater than zero and the evaporation enthalpy \( \delta_{ev} \) approaches \( h_a \) equals 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat transfer rate \( Q \) is equal to the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) times the difference in enthalpy between \( h_a \) and \( h_e \), which simplifies to \( h_a - h_e \).

The pressure \( p \) is 4.2391.

The quality \( x_a \) is calculated as the ratio of the difference between \( h_a \) and \( h_f \) to the difference between \( h_g \) and \( h_f \), which equals 0.337.

Underlined value: 156.28 Watts.
