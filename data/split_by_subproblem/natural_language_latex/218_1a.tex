The subsection is titled "Qaus?"

1. The first equation is:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance, plus the sum of heat transfer rates minus the power output.

2. The equation for \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) is:
\( Q_{\text{aus}} \) equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at entrance and the enthalpy at exit, and this is multiplied by \( \dot{Q}_2 \).

3. The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is given as:
0.3 kilograms per second.

4. The enthalpy at exit \( h_e \) is:
\( h_e \) equals \( h_f \) at 10 degrees Celsius with quality \( x \) equals zero, which is 252.38 kilojoules per kilogram, referenced from Table A-2.

5. The enthalpy at entrance \( h_a \) is:
\( h_a \) equals \( h_f \) at 100 degrees Celsius with quality \( x \) equals zero, which is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

6. The equation for \( Q_{\text{aus}} \) in terms of numerical values is:
\( Q_{\text{aus}} \) equals 0.3 kilograms per second times the difference between 419.64 and 252.38 kilojoules per kilogram, minus 100 kilojoules per second.

7. The final result is:
Negative 62.18 kilojoules per second, which is also expressed in kilowatts.
