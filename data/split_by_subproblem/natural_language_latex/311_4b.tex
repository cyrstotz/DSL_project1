1HS Compressor

The equation is zero equals mass flow rate times the difference between h2 and h3, times the power input rate.

(There is a diagram here showing a process with two curves. The first curve starts at a point labeled power input rate and goes up and down, ending at a point labeled s2 equals s3. The second curve starts at a point labeled power input rate and goes up and down, ending at a point labeled mass flow rate.)

The mass flow rate equals the power input rate divided by the difference between h2 and h3.

s2 equals s3.

p1 equals p2.

x4 equals zero, p4 equals 8 bar, t4 equals 31 to 33 degrees Celsius.

1HS Throttle

The product of mass flow rate and the difference between h4 and h1 equals zero, h4 equals h1.
