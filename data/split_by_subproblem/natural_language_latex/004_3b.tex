The pressure \( p_g \) is 1.5 bar and the mass \( m_g \) is 3.6 grams.

The pressure \( p_{g2} \) is equal to \( p_{g1} \), which is 1.5 bar, because the mass \( m_{EW} \) remains the same.

The temperature \( T_{g2} \) is 0 degrees Celsius because \( T_{E1S2} \) is equal to \( T_{g2} \) and \( T_{E1S2} \) is 0 degrees Celsius since the ice fraction \( x_{eis} \) is greater than 0.
