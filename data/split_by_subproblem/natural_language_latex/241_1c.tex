The rate of entropy generation, denoted as S dot subscript "erz", is equal to the mass flow rate, m dot, times the difference between the entropy at the outlet, S subscript "aus", and the entropy at the inlet, S subscript "ein", minus the heat transfer rate at the outlet, Q dot subscript "aus", divided by the temperature at the condenser, T subscript "KF". This value equals 0.3177 kilojoules per second per Kelvin.

The entropy at the outlet, S subscript "aus", at a quality x equals 0 and a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius, is 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

The entropy at the inlet, S subscript "ein", at a quality x equals 0 and a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius, is 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.
