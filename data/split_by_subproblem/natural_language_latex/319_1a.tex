The derivative with respect to time t of the sum of the terms: mass flow rate times specific enthalpy, mass flow rate times half the square of velocity, and mass flow rate times gravitational acceleration times height, plus the sum of heat flow rates and the sum of work rates equals zero.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the specific enthalpy at the inlet and the specific enthalpy at the outlet, plus the heat flow rate added minus the heat flow rate removed.

The specific enthalpy at the inlet, denoted as \( h_{\text{ein}} \), for a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius is 232.58 kilojoules per kilogram.

The specific enthalpy at the outlet, denoted as \( h_{\text{aus}} \), for a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

The heat flow rate removed, denoted as \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \), is 62.182 kilowatts.
