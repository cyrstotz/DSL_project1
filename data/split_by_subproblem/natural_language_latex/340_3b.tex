T1,2 equals TEis, therefore no new hypothesis.

TEis equals TEis, because there is no ice.

T1,2 equals 0 degrees Celsius, which is 273.15 Kelvin.

The temperature is 0 degrees because there is still ice in the upper container, which means all the water above the ice has sealed off, spoken to the ice, and not heated.

The density rho2 equals rho1, which is 1.4 grams per cubic centimeter divided by 1.4 grams per cubic centimeter, equals 1.4 grams per cubic centimeter.

The pressure does not change, as the equilibrium of forces must still apply.

Calculations:

The rate of energy EW equals kinetic energy.

The rate of energy EW equals the mass flow rate m1 divided by area A plus mass flow rate m2 equals (7.9 times 0.9) divided by (0.6 times 0.7 times 1.1) plus Q equals q1 plus q2.

u2 equals uW plus q1 plus q2 times (u1 divided by (u2 minus u1)).

The mass flow rate m1 equals 7.9 times 0.9 equals 7.11.

u2 equals Q divided by (m times u1).

u2 equals (7.9 times 287 times 10 to the power of minus 3) divided by 0.14 plus (-200.6 times 614 kilojoules per kilogram) equals -192.300 kilojoules per kilogram.

Beta equals (7.9 times mass flow rate m1) divided by (u1 times mass flow rate m2) times (u1 divided by (u2 minus u1)).

XW equals (u2 minus uW) divided by (u1 minus uW) equals (-192.300 minus (-3.33 times 9.8)) divided by (-0.085 minus (-7.33 times 5.55)) equals 0.42333.

XExp equals 1 minus XW equals 0.57663.
