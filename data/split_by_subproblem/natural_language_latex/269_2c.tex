c) U12 equals Q12 minus W12.

Q12 equals U12 plus W12, which is 4367.157 Joules.
U12 equals CV times the difference in temperature from T1 to T2 times the mass, which is -1082.868 Joules.
CV equals 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.
W12 equals the integral of pressure p with respect to volume V.
W12 is approximately equal to the pressure p times the difference in volume from V1 to V2, which is approximately -284.189 Joules.
