The exergy at state 0, denoted as e_{ex,0}, is equal to h_0 minus h_0 minus T_0 times the difference of s_1 and s_0, plus the difference of w_1 squared and w_0 squared all over 2, plus pe.

The change in exergy at state 0, denoted as Delta e_{ex,0}, is equal to h_0 minus h_0 minus T_0 times the difference of s_0 and s_0, plus the difference of w_1 squared over 2 minus w_0 squared over 2. This simplifies to c_p times the difference of T_0 and T_0 minus T_0 times the quantity c_p times the natural logarithm of T_c over T_0 minus R times the natural logarithm of p_c over p_0, plus w_1 squared over 2 minus w_0 squared over 2. This results in 108,745 Joules per kilogram, which is repeated for emphasis.
