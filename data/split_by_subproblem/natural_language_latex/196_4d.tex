The value of epsilon_k is given by the equation:

epsilon_k equals the ratio of dot Q_zu over dot W_t, which is also equal to the ratio of dot Q_k over dot W_t.

It is stated that dot Q_zu equals dot Q_k.

The energy balance for Evaporator 1 is described by the equation:
zero equals dot m times (h_e minus h_a) plus dot Q_k minus dot W_turb.
From this, dot Q_k is derived as dot m times (h_a minus h_e).

Substituting values, dot Q_k equals 0.933 kilograms per second times (237.74 kilojoules per kilogram minus 93.92 kilojoules per kilogram), which results in 0.15038 kilojoules per second.

Finally, epsilon_k is calculated as the ratio of dot Q_k over dot W_t, which equals 0.15038 kilowatts divided by 0.028 kilowatts, resulting in approximately 5.371.
