b) Required:
The average temperature T_m is equal to the ratio of T_K to T_K.

The outlet temperature T_U,aus is 298.12 Kelvin, equal to T_K2.

The outlet temperature T_K,aus is 288.15 Kelvin, equal to T_K1.

The average temperature T_bar is given by the integral from s_e to s_a of T ds divided by s_a minus s_e, which implies that (T_2 minus T_1) divided by the natural logarithm of (T_2 divided by T_1) equals 293.12 Kelvin.

g) Required: S_dot_evz

To the reactor and cooling jacket.

Only S_dot_evz on Q_dot implies a closed system.

Zero equals m_dot times (s_e minus s_a) plus Q_dot divided by T plus S_dot_evz.

Negative S_dot_evz equals m_dot times (s_e minus s_a) plus Q_dot_R divided by T_R plus Q_dot_aus divided by T_K.

Negative S_dot_evz equals negative 62.182 kilowatts divided by 293.12 Kelvin, which equals negative 0.2121 kilowatts per Kelvin.

S_dot_evz equals 0.2121 kilowatts per Kelvin.

Figure Description: The figure is a cylindrical reactor with a cooling jacket. The cylinder is oriented vertically. There are arrows pointing to the left and right sides of the cylinder, labeled T and Q_dot_aus respectively. At the bottom of the cylinder, there is an arrow pointing downwards labeled Q_dot_R. There is also a label s_ps near the bottom right of the cylinder.

Equations next to the figure:
T equals 293.12 Kelvin.
Q_dot_R equals 100 kilowatts.
Q_dot_aus equals negative 62.182 kilowatts.
m_dot equals 0.3 kilograms per second.
