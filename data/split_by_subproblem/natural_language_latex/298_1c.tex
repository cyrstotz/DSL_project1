The entropy flow, denoted as \(\dot{S}_{\text{ezu}}\), needs to be calculated and distributed in the heat exchanger, as shown in the mathematical flow diagram:

The entropy balance in the mathematical model is given by the equation:
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = \dot{m} \cdot s_1 + \sum \dot{Q}_j
\]

It follows that:
\[
\dot{S}_{\text{ezu}} = -\sum \frac{\dot{Q}}{T} = -\left( \frac{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}}{T_{\text{um}}} \right) = -\left( \frac{6 \text{kW}}{373.15 \text{K}} - 293.15 \text{K} \right) = 0.047 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}}
\]

The temperature is constant at 100Â°C, denoted as \(T_{\text{gescha}}\).

The heat flow \(\dot{Q}_{\text{out}}\) is negative because \(q_i\) is considered as (leis).
