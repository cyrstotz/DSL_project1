The temperature \( T_{\text{gz}} \) is \( 0^\circ \text{C} \), since the egg in water has a temperature of \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) and gas & egg white are in thermodynamic equilibrium. Since the weight from above (piston, egg, atmospheric pressure) is still the same, the pressure \( p_{2\alpha} = p_{\text{gg}} = 1.4 \text{bar} \).
