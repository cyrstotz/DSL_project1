The seventh equation of state is given by:

Zero equals the total mass times the quantity of h5 minus h6 plus half of W5 squared minus half of W6 squared.

Simplifying, we have:

Zero equals h5 minus h6 plus half of W5 squared minus half of W6 squared.

From which we derive:

W5 squared equals two times the quantity of h5 minus h6 plus half of W5 squared.

Further, we have:

W5 squared equals two times the specific heat capacity at constant pressure times the temperature difference between T5 and T6, plus W5 squared.

The temperature T6 is given by:

T6 equals T_s divided by the k-th root of T_s over P_s raised to the power of (k minus one) over k, which equals 9 plus 37.9 Kelvin, resulting in 328 Kelvin.

The velocity W6 is calculated as:

W6 equals the square root of two times 7.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference between 37.9 Kelvin and 328 Kelvin plus 220 meters per second,

which simplifies to:

220.9 meters per second.
