The equations are as follows:
Epsilon subscript k equals the absolute value of Q dot subscript zu divided by the absolute value of W dot, which equals the absolute value of Q dot subscript zu divided by the absolute value of Q dot subscript ab minus the absolute value of Q dot subscript zu.
Epsilon subscript k equals the absolute value of Q dot subscript k divided by the absolute value of Q dot subscript ab minus the absolute value of Q dot subscript k.
