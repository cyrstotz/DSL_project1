The subsection includes several mathematical expressions:

1. The symbol \( \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \) represents the rate of heat output.

2. The equation \( \dot{Q}_R = 100,000 \, W \) and \( T_R = 100^\circ C = 373.15 \, K \) states that the rate of heat input \( \dot{Q}_R \) is 100,000 watts and the temperature \( T_R \) is 100 degrees Celsius, which is equivalent to 373.15 Kelvin.

3. The expression "Stdt. Flie√üprozess" translates to "Standard Flow Process" and the equation \( 0 = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \) labeled as "Reaktion" (Reaction) represents a balance equation where the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy plus the heat input rate minus the heat output rate equals zero.

4. The equation \( 0 = \dot{m}_k (h_{er} - h_{ak}) + \dot{Q}_{\text{aus}} \) represents another balance equation involving a different mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_k \) and enthalpy difference, plus the heat output rate.

5. The expression \( m_{\text{ges}} = 5455 \, \text{kg} \) states that the total mass \( m_{\text{ges}} \) is 5455 kilograms.

6. The expression \( x_D = 0.005 \) represents a dimensionless quantity \( x_D \) with a value of 0.005.
