The ratio of T6 over T5 is equal to the ratio of P6 over P5 raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.

T6 equals T5 times the ratio of P0 over P5 raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n, which equals 439.9 Kelvin times the ratio of 0.994 bar over 0.5 bar raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4, resulting in 328.1 Kelvin.

Energy equation:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the quantity of h5 minus h6 plus the quantity of (w5 squared minus w0 squared) divided by 2.

h5 minus h6 equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference of T5 minus T6, which equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (439.9 minus 328.1), resulting in 112.4 kilojoules per kilogram.

w0 squared equals twice the quantity of h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared, which equals 2 times 112.4 plus 220 squared meters squared per second squared, resulting in 224.8 plus 48400 equals 48624.8 meters squared per second squared.

w0 equals the square root of 48624.8 meters squared per second squared, resulting in 220.5 meters per second.
