The graph described is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. It includes three curves and three points labeled 1, 2, and 3. The first curve is a vertical line that starts from point 1 and moves upwards to point 2. The second curve is a horizontal line that starts from point 2 and moves leftwards to point 3. The third curve is a diagonal line that starts from point 3 and moves upwards to the right. The x-axis is labeled with a right arrow and the letter T indicating temperature. The y-axis is labeled with a top arrow and the letter P indicating pressure.
