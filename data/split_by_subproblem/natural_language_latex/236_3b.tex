The equation pV equals mRT leads to p equals the fraction mRT over V, which simplifies to the fraction RT over nu.

Nu equals the fraction V over m. Nu sub 1 equals the fraction 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters over 3.43 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms, which equals 0.915 cubic meters per kilogram.

For a gas isobar, p sub 2 equals the fraction RT over nu sub 1, which equals 49.56 kiloPascals.
