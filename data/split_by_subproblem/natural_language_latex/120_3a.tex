a) Required: \(P_{1g}\), \(m_g\)

- A diagram is drawn showing a vertical cylinder with a piston inside. The piston is labeled with \(P_{eis}\) on top and \(P_{gas}\) on the bottom. The top of the cylinder is labeled \(P_1\) and the bottom is labeled \(P_3\). An arrow pointing downwards is labeled \(mg\).

- The pressure due to ice equals the pressure due to gas since there is equilibrium.

- The atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the mass and gravity over the area equals the pressure due to ice.

- \(1.10^5\) plus \(32\) times \(9.81\) minus the pressure due to ice equals \(1.399369\) bar.

- \(P_{1g}\) equals \(1.4\) bar.

- \(m_g\) equals the pressure at point 1 times the volume at point 1 divided by the gas constant \(R\) times the temperature at point 1.

- The gas constant \(R\) equals \(R\) divided by \(M\) which equals \(8344\) divided by \(50\) resulting in \(166.28\).

- \(m_g\) equals \(1.4\) times \(10^5\) times \(3.14\) times \(0.001\) divided by \(166.28\) times \(500 + 273.15\) minus \(0.003418\) kilograms equals \(3.4189\).
