The first equation is the indicator function for set A in the context of high school, denoted as "1 subscript A comma HS".

The second equation is:
Delta U equals m dot times the sum of d over dt plus d over dx, plus Q plus W.

The third equation is:
Q subscript 12 times Delta U equals U subscript 2 minus U subscript 1 times m times g.

The fourth equation is:
Q subscript 12 equals c times p times the difference T subscript 2 minus T subscript A, which equals 0.653 Joules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference 0.003 degrees Celsius minus 300 degrees Celsius times 0.005 kilograms.

The fifth equation is:
Q subscript 12 equals negative 1139.39 Joules.
