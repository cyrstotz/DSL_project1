The change in specific energy in the x-direction due to strain, denoted as delta e subscript x, str, is equal to e subscript x, str, c minus e subscript x, str, 0, which equals h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus one-half times (w subscript 6 squared minus w subscript 0 squared). This further simplifies to c subscript p times (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript 0 times (c subscript p times the natural logarithm of T subscript 6 over T subscript 0 minus R times the natural logarithm of p subscript 6 over p subscript 0) plus one-half times (w subscript 6 squared minus w subscript 0 squared).
