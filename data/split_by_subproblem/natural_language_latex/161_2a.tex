The pressure \( p_{3,1} \) is equal to the sum of the ambient pressure \( p_{\text{amb}} \) and the old total pressure \( p_{\text{ges,alt}} \).

The old total pressure \( p_{\text{ges,alt}} \) is calculated as the force \( F \) divided by the area \( A \), which is further expressed as the mass \( m \) times gravity \( g \) divided by \( \pi \) times the square of radius \( r_1 \). Substituting the values, \( m = 26 \, \text{kg} \), \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( r_1 = 0.1 \, \text{m} \), the pressure is calculated to be approximately \( 33363.53 \, \text{Pa} \) or about \( 0.4 \, \text{bar} \).

The pressure \( p_{3,1} \) is given as \( 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).

The ratio of the pressure \( p_{3,1} \) to the specific volume \( v_{g,1} \) is equal to the mass of gas \( m_g \) times the gas constant \( R_g \) times the temperature \( T_{g,1} \) divided by the molar mass \( M_g \).

The mass of gas \( m_g \) is calculated by rearranging the previous formula and substituting \( p_{3,1} = 1.4 \), \( v_{g,1} = 0.5 \), \( R_g = 0.412 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg} \), and \( T_{g,1} = 223.15 \, \text{K} \). The result is \( m_g = 3.8 \, \text{g} \) or \( 3.8 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \).

The total mixed pressure \( P_g \) is the sum of the mixed pressure \( P_{ges\text{mischt}} \) and the water pressure \( P_w \).

The mixed pressure \( P_{ges\text{mischt}} \) is calculated as the mass \( m \) times gravity \( g \) divided by the area \( A \), with \( m = 9 \, \text{bar} \) and \( A \) being the square of half the diameter \( D \) times \( \pi \). The result is \( 23567.5 \, \text{Pa} \).

The water pressure \( P_w \) is calculated as \( 0.045 \, \text{Pa} \).

The total pressure \( P_g \) is \( 1.1 \, \text{bar} \).

The mass of gas \( m_g \) is calculated using the formula for the ideal gas law rearranged for mass, resulting in \( m_g = 3.4 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \) or \( 3.4 \, \text{g} \).

The gas constant \( R_g \) per unit mass is calculated as \( R_g = 0.42 \, \frac{R}{\text{g} \cdot \text{K}} \).
