- A circular diagram with three arrows pointing outward from the center, labeled \( W_i \).
- The arrows are labeled 1, 2, and 3.
- \( x_2 = 1 \)
- \( p_3 = 8 \) bar
- \( \sigma = \frac{m}{n_{34}u} (e_{L2} - e_{L3}) - W_i \)

The equation is:
The rate of change of energy with respect to time equals the sum over i of the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy, half the square of velocity, and the product of gravitational acceleration and height, all at the inlet, minus the sum over o of the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy, half the square of velocity, and the product of gravitational acceleration and height, all at the outlet, plus the sum of heat transfer rate as a function of time, minus the sum of work rate as a function of time.
