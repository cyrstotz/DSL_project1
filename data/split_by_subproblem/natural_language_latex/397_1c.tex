c) The heat output, Q dot out, equals 65 kilowatts, and the average temperature of the coolant, T bar KF, equals 298 Kelvin.

From the entropy balance:
The equation is zero equals m dot times (s_e minus s_a) plus the sum over j of Q dot j divided by T_j plus S dot generated.

The generated entropy, S dot generated, equals m dot times (s_e minus s_a) minus Q dot j divided by 298 Kelvin.

From Table A-2:
The entropy at the exit, s_e, equals s_f at 15 degrees Celsius, which is 62.99 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
The entropy at the entrance, s_a, equals s_f at 250 degrees Celsius, which is 104.88 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The generated entropy, S dot generated, equals 0.3 kilograms per second times (62.99 minus 104.88) kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 65 kilowatts divided by 298 Kelvin.
This results in -12.79 kilowatts per Kelvin.
