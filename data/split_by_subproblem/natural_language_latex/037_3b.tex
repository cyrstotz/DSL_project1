In a solid-liquid phase, the temperature remains constant while \( x_{Ein} \) goes from 1 to 0. The pressure remains the same.

For part c), the change in energy \( \Delta E \) is equal to \( U_2 - U_1 \), which is \( Q_{12} - W_{12} \). This is further calculated as \( m_{gas} \cdot c_v \cdot (T_{2s} - T_{1s}) \), but this expression is crossed out multiple times, indicating it is not considered in the final calculation. The temperature \( T_{2s} \) is also crossed out multiple times.
