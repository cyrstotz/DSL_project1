The rate of heat loss, denoted as Q-dot with subscript x, verl, equals the product of c-dot and the ratio of S-dot with subscript erz to m-dot with subscript ges. This implies that the energy loss per unit mass, denoted as e with subscript x, verl, equals the product of the temperature T-zero and S with subscript erz, divided by m-dot with subscript ges.

S with subscript erz equals the product of m-dot and the difference between s-two and s-one, where T-zero equals 293.15 Kelvin.

This implies that the energy loss per unit mass, e with subscript x, verl, equals the product of T-zero, m-dot, and the difference between s-two and s-one, all divided by m-dot with subscript ges.

The difference s-two minus s-one equals.
