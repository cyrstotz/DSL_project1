Q equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 5 and state 6, multiplied by time, minus the power output.

T6 equals T5 times the ratio of pressure at state 6 to pressure at state 5, raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n, which equals 328.07 Kelvin.

The reversible work output W dot t rev equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 5 and state 6, which equals the mass flow rate times the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between state 5 and state 6, which equals 104.45 kilowatts.

The reversible work output W dot t rev equals the integral from state 5 to state 6 of specific volume times the change in pressure plus half the difference between the square of the velocity at state 6 and the square of the velocity at state 5.

The integral from state 5 to state 6 of specific volume times the change in pressure equals negative n times the integral from state 5 to state 6 of specific volume times the change in specific volume, which equals negative n divided by (1 minus n) times the gas constant times the difference in temperature between state 6 and state 5, which equals negative 104.45 kilowatts.

n equals the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to specific heat at constant volume, which is 1.4, and the specific heat at constant volume equals 0.7186 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The gas constant R equals the specific heat at constant pressure minus the specific heat at constant volume, which equals 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
