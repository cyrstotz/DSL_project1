The mass of the evaporating water multiplied by the change in internal energy from state 1 to state 2 equals the heat transfer from state 1 to state 2.

The internal energy at state 1 is equal to the internal energy at the saturated liquid state at 0 degrees Celsius plus the quality (x) times the difference between the internal energy at the saturated vapor state and the saturated liquid state at 0 degrees Celsius. This results in -0.085 plus 0.6 times the difference of -333.858 and 0.085, which equals -200.0928 kilojoules.

The internal energy at state 2 is equal to the heat transfer from state 1 to state 2 divided by the mass of the evaporating water plus the internal energy at state 1, resulting in -186.448 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy at state 2 is also expressed as the internal energy at the saturated liquid state plus the quality at state 2 times the difference between the internal energy at the saturated vapor state and the saturated liquid state.

The quality at state 2 is calculated as the difference between the internal energy at state 2 and the internal energy at the saturated liquid state, divided by the difference between the internal energy at the saturated vapor state and the saturated liquid state. This results in a quality of 0.559.
