The rate of entropy production for the cooling and reheating process, denoted as S dot subscript c comma r, equals the mass flow rate, denoted as m dot, times the difference between the entropy at point A and point C, minus the ratio of the heat flow rate out, denoted as Q dot subscript aus, to the temperature at the condenser, denoted as T subscript KF, equals.
