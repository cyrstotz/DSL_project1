isotropic shear nozzle implies the ratio of T_G over T_S equals the ratio of P_G over P_S raised to the power of (n-1) over n. This leads to T_G equals T_S times the ratio of P_G over P_S raised to the power of (n-1) over n, which equals 431.9 Kelvin times the ratio of 0.19 over 0.5 raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4, resulting in 328.67 Kelvin equals T_G.

First Law of Thermodynamics: The rate of change of energy equals the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy at state S and half the square of velocity at state S minus enthalpy at state G minus half the square of velocity at state G plus the sum of heat transfer rates minus the sum of work rates.

The velocity at state G equals the square root of twice the difference between the enthalpy at state S plus half the square of velocity at state S minus the enthalpy at state G.

The difference in enthalpy between state S and state G equals the specific heat at constant pressure times the difference in temperature between state S and state G.

This leads to the velocity at state G equals the square root of twice the sum of the specific heat at constant pressure times the temperature difference between state S and state G plus half the square of velocity at state S, resulting in 257.3 meters per second.

This results in the velocity at state G equals 487.8 meters per second, which is correct.
