The volume V subscript e2 equals the volume V subscript e1 divided by the mass m subscript e1, multiplied by the mass m subscript e2.

The pressure p subscript e2 equals the pressure p subscript e1, which is 1.4 bar, since the masses m subscript e1, m subscript e2, and the pressure p subscript 0 do not change.

The mass m subscript e1 times the quantity v subscript e2 squared minus v subscript e1 squared, all divided by 2, equals Q dot.

The density rho equals the gas constant R divided by the product of the area A subscript e2 and the temperature T subscript e2.

The volume V subscript e2 divided by the mass m subscript e2 equals the product of the pressure p subscript e2 and the volume V subscript e2 divided by the product of the mass m subscript e2 and R divided by the temperature T subscript e2.
