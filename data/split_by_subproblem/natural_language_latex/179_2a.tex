The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as S with the unit kilojoules per kilogram, and the y-axis is labeled as T with the unit Kelvin. The graph consists of a closed loop with six points labeled 1 through 6. The path from point 1 to point 2 is a vertical line labeled as "isobar". The path from point 2 to point 3 is a curved line labeled as "isenthalpic". The path from point 3 to point 4 is a horizontal line labeled as "isobar". The path from point 4 to point 5 is a curved line labeled as "isenthalpic". The path from point 5 to point 6 is a vertical line labeled as "isobar". The path from point 6 to point 1 is a curved line labeled as "isenthalpic".
