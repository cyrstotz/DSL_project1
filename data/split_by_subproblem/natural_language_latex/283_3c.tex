Table for Gas (m = 3.92g)

The table has four columns labeled P, V, and T. It contains the following rows:
1. Pressure: 1.3997 bar, Volume: 3.19 L, Temperature: 773.15 K
2. Pressure: 1.3997 bar, Volume: 0.0011 m³, Temperature: 273.153 K

Ideal Gas Law:
The volume V_z is calculated using the formula:
V_z equals (R_g times m_g times T_2) divided by p_2, which equals (166.3 Joules per (kg times Kelvin) times 0.00392 kg times 273.153 Kelvin) divided by 139970 Pascals, resulting in 0.0011 m³.
