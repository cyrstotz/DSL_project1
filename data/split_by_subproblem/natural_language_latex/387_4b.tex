The mass flow rate for Re equals the mass flow rate for Ra.

Zero equals negative mass flow rate in minus initial volume flow rate plus Q, which is greater than or equal to zero.

h sub 2 equals h sub 1 divided by 2.

h sub 4 equals 52 watts per second, and h sub 2 in units of watts per second.

h sub 4 equals 32.75 watts per second.

h sub 2 equals h sub 2 at negative 16 degrees Celsius.

s sub 2 equals s sub 2 minus 0.0258 times h sub 2 over s sub k.

A divided by 10 equals 237.7 times T over s.

Equation number 2.3.

p sub 2 equals 1 bar.

T sub i equals negative 10 degrees Celsius.

T sub i equals negative 10 degrees Celsius.

A sub u of s equals constant.

A matrix with A sub 12 and y sub sat in the first row, and 1 and F sub sat in the second row.

The fraction of S minus S sub sat of y sub b over S sub sat of y sub a minus S sub sat of y sub b times the difference of h sub S of s sub a minus h sub u of s minus h sub u of s.

t sub 3 equals 27.31.

The rate of change of U sub u equals the mass flow rate sub E times the difference of h sub 2 minus h sub 3.

The mass flow rate sub E equals the difference of mass flow rate sub u minus the rate of change of U sub u over the difference of h sub 2 minus h sub 3 minus 9.8 kilograms per second.
