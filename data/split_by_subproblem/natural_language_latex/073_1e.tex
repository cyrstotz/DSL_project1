e) Entropy balance

The rate of change of entropy S with respect to time t is equal to the mass flow rate in times the entropy in minus the heat transfer rate in divided by the temperature T_j plus the generated entropy S_erz as a function of time t.

The change in entropy Delta S is equal to the mass at state 2 times the entropy at state 2 minus the mass at state 1 times the entropy at state 1.

The mass at state 2 is equal to the mass at state 1 plus the mass flow rate from state 1 to state 2, which calculates to 5755 kilograms plus 3600 kilograms equals 9355 kilograms.

The entropy at state 2 is calculated as 0.8549 plus half the difference between 7.7553 and 0.8549, resulting in 4.3551 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy at state 1 is calculated as 1.3069 plus 0.005 times the difference between 7.3549 and 1.3069, resulting in 1.33714 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The change in entropy from state 1 to state 2, Delta S_12, is calculated as the mass at state 2 times the entropy at state 2 minus the mass at state 1 times the entropy at state 1, which equals 9355 kilograms times 4.3551 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 5755 kilograms times 1.33714 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

This results in 33046.7 kilojoules per Kelvin, which is equal to 33.05 megajoules per Kelvin.
