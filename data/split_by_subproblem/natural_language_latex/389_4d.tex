The energy E_k is equal to the absolute value of the rate of heat input Q_zu divided by the absolute value of the rate of work W_k.

The rate of work W_t is equal to the rate of work W_k, which is 28 watts.

The absolute value of the rate of heat input Q_zu is equal to the absolute value of the rate of heat Q_k.

Energy balance for the evaporator/condenser:
The rate of change of energy with respect to time dE/dt is equal to the mass flow rate m dot times the difference in enthalpy h_1 minus h_2, plus the rate of heat Q_k minus the rate of work W_t, which equals zero.

The rate of heat Q_k is equal to the mass flow rate m dot times the difference in enthalpy h_2 minus h_1.

The mass flow rate m dot is 4 kilograms per hour times the difference in enthalpy 239.08 kilojoules per kilogram minus 93.92 kilojoules per kilogram.

This equals 562.64 kilojoules per hour.

Which is equal to 0.156 kilojoules per second, or 156 watts.

Therefore, E_k is equal to the rate of heat Q_k divided by the rate of work W_k, which is 156 watts divided by 28 watts, resulting in 5.57 for E_k.
