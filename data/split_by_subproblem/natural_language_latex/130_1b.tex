The fraction T over T subscript KF times the square root of the fraction T over S subscript a times S subscript e equals the fraction T subscript a minus T subscript e over S subscript a minus S subscript e, which equals the fraction T subscript a minus T subscript e over c times the natural logarithm of the fraction T subscript a over T subscript e, where c is unknown.

S subscript a minus S subscript e equals c times the natural logarithm of the fraction T subscript e over T subscript 1, which leads to 298 Kelvin.

This implies that the fraction T subscript KF over T subscript KF equals the average of T subscript 1 and T subscript 2, which is 293.15 Kelvin.
