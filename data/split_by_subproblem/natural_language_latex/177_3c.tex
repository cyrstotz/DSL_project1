The derivative of E with respect to t equals the heat transfer rate Q12, representing the first law of thermodynamics in the gas container.

The mass times the difference in internal energy (u2 minus u1) equals the heat transfer Q12.

The mass times the specific heat at constant volume for an ideal gas times the temperature difference (T2 minus T1) equals the heat transfer Q12.

0.00342 kilograms times 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference between 273.15 Kelvin and 773.15 Kelvin equals the heat transfer Q12.

Q12 equals negative 1082 Joules, negative because it flows out of the system boundary (from gas to EW mixture).
