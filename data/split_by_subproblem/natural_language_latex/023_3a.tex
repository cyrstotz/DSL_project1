- The value of \( p_{g,1} \) is unknown.
- The mass \( m_g \) is unknown.
- The area \( A \) is calculated as the square of half the diameter \( d \) times pi, which equals 0.00785 square meters.
- The pressure \( p \) is defined as the force \( F \) divided by the area \( A \).
- The pressure \( p_1 \) is calculated as the force \( F \) divided by the area \( A \) plus the ambient pressure \( p_{\text{amb}} \).
- The force \( F \) is calculated as the sum of the mass of the object \( m_k \) and the total mass \( m_{ges} \) times the acceleration due to gravity \( g \), which equals 3491.7 Newtons.
- The conversion from Pascals to bar is given as 140114.8 Pascals equals 1.4 bar.
- The mass \( m \) is calculated using the formula \( m = \frac{p_1 V_1}{R T_1} \).
- The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as the universal gas constant \( \bar{R} \) divided by the molar mass \( M \), which equals 0.16628 cubic meters times Pascals per kilogram per Kelvin.
- The mass \( m \) is calculated to be 3.4 grams.
