Energy balance for a semi-open system:

Zero equals the change in mass flow rate from state 1 to state 2 times the difference between the specific enthalpy at state A1 and state A2, minus the heat transferred out from state 1 to state 2.

This implies that the change in mass flow rate from state 1 to state 2 equals the heat transferred out from state 1 to state 2 divided by the difference between the specific enthalpy at state A1 and state A2.

The specific enthalpy at state A1, at 70 degrees Celsius, is 293.78 kilojoules per kilogram.

The specific enthalpy at state A2 is calculated as the specific enthalpy at state A1 at 70 degrees Celsius plus the dryness fraction times the difference between the specific enthalpy of vapor and the specific enthalpy of fluid, both at 70 degrees Celsius.

This results in 293.78 kilojoules per kilogram plus 0.005 times the difference between 2662.8 kilojoules per kilogram and 293.78 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 304.65 kilojoules per kilogram.
