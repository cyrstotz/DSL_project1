a) Quasi is
- Compensation on
- Delta equals the average value plus Quasi

In a table format:
- The columns are labeled as: State, P, V, T, h
- Row 1: Temperature is 700 degrees Celsius
- Row 2: Temperature is 1000 degrees Celsius

- Alpha equals 0.005 h

Energy conservation equation:
- The mass flow rate times the change in enthalpy equals the heat flow plus the mass flow rate times the change in internal energy.
- Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy in and enthalpy out plus the heat flow, which implies that the heat flow out equals the heat flow.
- The enthalpy in at 100 degrees Celsius in saturation state implies TAD A Z equals 292.38 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The enthalpy out at 100 degrees Celsius, h plus h_f, implies negative TAD A Z' equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The heat flow out equals the heat flow plus the mass flow rate in times the difference (292.38 minus 419.04) kilojoules per kilogram equals 67.182 kilowatts.
