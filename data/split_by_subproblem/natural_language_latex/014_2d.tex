Calculate with 100 kilojoules per kilogram.

Energy balance around everything:

The exergy efficiency of the electric component equals the change in exergy plus zero for adiabatic conditions minus the turbine work rate.

The turbine work rate equals the shaft work rate.

The reversible speed equals R times the difference between the ambient temperature and the source temperature divided by one minus the efficiency, which equals 65.935 kilowatts per kilogram.
