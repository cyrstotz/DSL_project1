c) Internal energy of the gas:

The change in internal energy, Delta U, is equal to m times u_2 minus m times u_1,
which simplifies to m times the difference between u_2 and u_1,
which further simplifies to m times c_v times the difference between T_2 and T_1,
resulting in 0.00293 kilograms times 0.653 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference between 0.003 times 273.15 and (500 minus 273.15 times 41),
which equals negative 0.927 Joules.

The work done from state 1 to state 2, W_{u,1-2}, is equal to m times the integral from state 1 to state 2 of p dv.

The ratio n is equal to the ratio of c_p to c_v, which is equal to (R plus c_v) divided by c_v,
resulting in 1.263.

The work done from state 1 to state 2, W_{u,1-2}, is equal to m times the integral from state 1 to state 2 of R times the difference between T_2 and T_1 divided by (1 minus n),
which equals 0.926 Joules.
