This is now stationary. The equation is the mass flow rate times the change in entropy plus the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature plus the generated entropy equals zero. This implies that the negative of the generated entropy equals the mass flow rate times the change in entropy plus the heat transfer rate divided by the temperature. 

The value of S_er12 is 0.274 kilojoules per Kelvin.
