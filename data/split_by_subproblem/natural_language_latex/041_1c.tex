With T_KF equals 295 Kelvin,
that is, freezing point at zero small mass,
the rate of change of entropy, dS/dt, equals the sum of m dot subscript i times s subscript i plus the sum of Q dot subscript j over T subscript j plus S dot subscript generated.
S dot subscript generated equals negative Q dot subscript out over T subscript KF equals 62.3 kilowatts over 295 Kelvin equals 0.21 kilojoules per Kelvin.

(A small diagram is drawn here)

The diagram consists of a vertical line labeled "Reactor" on the right side. To the left of this line, there is a small rectangle labeled "Heat after".
