The generated entropy, denoted as S dot with subscript "erzeugt", equals the entropy in the reactor, denoted as S dot with subscript "Reaktor", since the generated entropy is zero.

Entropy balance at the reactor:
The initial entropy, denoted as S dot with subscript zero, equals the limit of the mass flow rate, denoted as m dot with subscript "massestrom", in a steady state.

The equation zero equals m dot times the difference between the entropy at the exit, denoted as s subscript e, and the entropy at the entrance, denoted as s subscript a, plus the sum of the heat transfer rates at the reactor, denoted as Q dot with subscript R, and the surrounding, denoted as Q dot with subscript "um", divided by the temperature at the surrounding, denoted as T with subscript "UF", plus the generated entropy.

The generated entropy equals negative 0.0241, which is not possible.

Further, the entropy at the exit, denoted as s subscript e, equals the entropy at the fluid, denoted as s subscript f, plus x times the difference between the entropy at the gas, denoted as s subscript g, and the entropy at the fluid.

The entropy at the entrance, denoted as s subscript a, equals the entropy at the fluid plus x times the difference between the entropy at the gas and the entropy at the fluid.

The entropy at the exit equals 0.98890 plus the fraction of two times one divided by two times four.

The entropy at the entrance equals 1.33 plus the fraction of one times one divided by four times one.
