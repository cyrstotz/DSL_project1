The equation for \( T_{\text{KF}} \) is given by the fraction of the integral of \( s \) times \( T \) with respect to \( s \) over the difference \( s_a - s_e \). This is equal to the fraction of \( h_a - h_e \) over \( s_a - s_e \), which equals \( c_p \) times the natural logarithm of \( T_2 \) over \( T_1 \) divided by \( T_2 - T_1 \), resulting in \( 0.003 \) degrees Celsius.

The integral of \( s \) times \( T \) with respect to \( s \) is equal to the integral of \( dh \) plus \( v \) times \( dp \).

For an ideal fluid, \( v dp = 0 \) because it is incompressible.
