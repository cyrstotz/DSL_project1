The expression is:
The derivative of E with respect to t minus the sum of dot m sub i times the quantity h sub i plus k sub i squared over 2 plus p sub i squared over 2, plus the sum of dot Q sub i minus the sum of dot W sub i.

The next expression is:
Dot Q equals dot m times the quantity h sub a minus h sub e equals dot m times an empty quantity.
