The reversible external specific energy at the reference state, denoted as e-dot subscript xt,rev,0, is calculated as follows:
(h0 minus h0 minus T0 times (s0 minus s0) plus w0 squared over 2) equals w0 squared over 2 equals 20 kilojoules per kilogram.

The reversible external specific energy, denoted as e-dot subscript xt,rev, is calculated as:
h0 minus h0 minus T0 times (s0 minus s0) plus w0 squared over 2 equals cp times (T0 minus T0) minus T0 times (cp times the natural logarithm of (T0 over T0) minus R times the natural logarithm of (p0 over p0)) plus w0 squared over 2.

This simplifies to:
1.005 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (340 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin) minus 243.15 Kelvin times the natural logarithm of (340 Kelvin over 243.15 Kelvin) plus (540 meters per second squared over 2).

The result is:
145.47 kilojoules per kilogram.

The change in reversible external specific energy, denoted as Delta e-dot subscript xt,rev, is:
125.47 kilojoules per kilogram.
