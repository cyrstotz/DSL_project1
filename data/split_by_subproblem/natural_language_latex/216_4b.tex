The text reads: "2-3 1. Adiabatic process process."

The equations are:
1. Q equals m times the sum of h subscript e minus h subscript a plus three halves of c minus v.
2. W equals m times the difference of h subscript e and h subscript a, which is also equal to m times the difference of h subscript 2 and h subscript 3.
3. m equals W divided by the difference of h subscript e and h subscript a.
4. h subscript 2 equals (no value provided).
5. h subscript 3 equals (no value provided).
