Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between h2 and ha, plus the heat transfer rate minus the work rate.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between h2 and h3 minus the work rate.

The work rate divided by the difference between h2 and h3 equals the mass flow rate.

h2 equals the enthalpy at saturation condition at temperature T2 and pressure pk2, which is 259.60 kilojoules per kilogram.

h3 equals the enthalpy at fluid condition at 8 bar, which is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at saturation condition at 220 degrees Celsius equals (266.45 minus 258.36) divided by (261 minus 20) times (22 minus 20) plus 258.36, which results in 259.40 kilojoules per kilogram.

p1 equals p2.

p3 equals 8 bar.

x2 equals 1.

T2 equals T1 minus 6 Kelvin, which is minus 22 degrees Celsius.
