The graph is a plot on grid paper with the vertical axis labeled as 'p' and the horizontal axis labeled as 'T'. The graph consists of a curve that starts at point 1, rises to point 4, dips slightly, and then rises again to point 3. There is a horizontal line connecting points 1 and 2. The curve intersects this horizontal line at point 2 and continues to rise to point 3. The points are labeled as follows:
- Point 1: At the intersection of the horizontal line and the curve.
- Point 2: On the horizontal line, to the right of point 1.
- Point 3: At the peak of the curve, to the right of point 2.
- Point 4: At the peak of the initial rise of the curve, above point 1.
