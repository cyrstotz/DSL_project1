Item d) contains three equations:

1. The derivative of E with respect to t equals zero, written as dE/dt = 0.

2. The heat transfer Q is equal to the product of the total mass m_ges,1 and the difference in enthalpy h_ges at 70 degrees Celsius and h at 100 degrees Celsius, plus the product of the mass m_12 and the difference in enthalpy h at 70 degrees Celsius and h at 20 degrees Celsius. This is expressed as:
   Q = m_ges,1 * (h_ges(70°C) - h(100°C)) + m_12 * (h(70°C) - h(20°C)).

3. The mass m_12 is calculated as the negative of the total mass m_ges,1 times the ratio of the difference in enthalpy h at 70 degrees Celsius and h at 100 degrees Celsius to the difference in enthalpy h at 70 degrees Celsius and h at 20 degrees Celsius. This results in m_12 being equal to -8.755 kJ/kg * (292.88 kJ/kg - 419.09 kJ/kg) / (292.88 kJ/kg - 83.96 kJ/kg), which equals 3970 kg, denoted as Δm_12.
