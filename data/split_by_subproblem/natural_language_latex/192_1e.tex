Delta S equals the quantity m1 plus Delta m times S2 minus m1 times S1.

S1 is at 100 degrees Celsius with x equals 0.005.

Implying A2, S1 equals Sf at 100 degrees plus x times the difference between Sg at 100 degrees and Sf at 100 degrees, where Sf at 100 degrees is 1.3064 and Sg at 100 degrees is 7.3543.

S1 equals 1.33714 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

S2 is at 70 degrees Celsius with x equals 0.005, implying A2.

S2 equals Sf at 70 degrees plus x times the difference between Sg at 70 degrees and Sf at 70 degrees, where Sf at 70 degrees is 0.9549 and Sg at 70 degrees is 7.7553.

S2 equals 0.9888 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

Delta S equals the quantity m1 plus Delta m times S2 minus m1 times S1 equals 1439.2 kilojoules per Kelvin, which equals Delta S.
