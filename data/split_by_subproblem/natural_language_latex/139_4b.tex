The change in energy at steady state is given by the sum over i of the mass flow rate times the sum of enthalpy, kinetic energy per unit mass, and potential energy per unit mass, all evaluated at zero, plus the sum over j of the internal heat transfer rates.

The rate of change of energy with respect to time equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between the exit and the ambient, plus the heat transfer rate at the compressor minus the work rate at the compressor.

The change in energy equals the change in internal energy plus the change in kinetic energy plus the change in potential energy.

The work rate at the compressor minus the heat transfer rate at the compressor equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between the exit and the ambient.

The work rate at the compressor is given as 26 watts (from the problem statement).
