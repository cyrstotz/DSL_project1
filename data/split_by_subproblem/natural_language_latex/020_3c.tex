The equations are as follows:

1. m times the difference of u_2 and u_1 equals Q_12.

2. The difference between u_2 and u_1 equals c_v^pg times the difference between T_2 and T_1.

3. Therefore, Q_12 equals m times c_v^pg times the difference between T_2 and T_1, which calculates to 0.0034 grams times 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the sum of 773.15 Kelvin and 273.153 Kelvin, resulting in -1076 Joules.
