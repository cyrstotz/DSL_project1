A equals r squared times pi.
r equals 0.05 meters.
A equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.
P subscript k equals F over A.
F equals m times g.
P subscript k equals (32 times 9.81) divided by (7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3) equals 39369.53 Pascals, approximately 0.399 bar.
P subscript ew equals (m subscript ew times 9.81) divided by A equals (0.1 times 9.81) divided by (7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3) equals 124.00 Pascals, approximately 1.249 times 10 to the power of negative 3 bar.
P subscript g1 equals P subscript k plus P subscript ew plus P subscript amb equals 1.4 bar.
P subscript g1 times V subscript g1 equals (m subscript g times R times T) divided by M.
m subscript g equals (P subscript g1 times V subscript g1 times M) divided by (R times T) equals (1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters times 50 kilograms per kmol) divided by (8.314 times (500 plus 273.15)).
m subscript g equals 0.818 grams.
