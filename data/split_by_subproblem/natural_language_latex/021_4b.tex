1 to 2: isobaric evaporation, pressure at state 1 equals pressure at state 2, quality at state 1 equals 1 indicating complete evaporation.
2 to 3: adiabatic isochoric process, entropy at state 2 equals entropy at state 3.
3 to 4: isobaric process, pressure at state 3 equals pressure at state 4, quality at state 4 equals 0.
The equation is zero equals mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between state 2 and state 3 minus the work done by the compressor.
The enthalpy at state 3 equals the enthalpy at state 2 at a pressure of 8 bar, which is 2694.15 kilojoules per kilogram.
The entropy at state 1 equals the entropy at state 2, which equals the entropy of gas at a pressure of 8 bar, which is 0.906 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
The pressure at state 4 is 8 bar.
The enthalpy at state 4 equals the enthalpy of fluid at a pressure of 8 bar, which is 53.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
The entropy of fluid at a pressure of 8 bar equals 0.3455 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
