The enthalpy at 8 bar is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy h_f is equal to h_1, which is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.

The temperature T_4 is 37.33 degrees Celsius, which is equal to T_1.

The enthalpy h_1,f at temperature T_1 is equal to the enthalpy at 30 degrees Celsius plus the fraction (37.33 minus 30) divided by (32 minus 30) times the difference between the enthalpy at 32 degrees Celsius and the enthalpy at 30 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy h_1,g at temperature T_1 is equal to the enthalpy at 30 degrees Celsius plus the fraction (37.33 minus 30) divided by (32 minus 30) times the difference between the enthalpy at 32 degrees Celsius and the enthalpy at 30 degrees Celsius.

The enthalpy at 30 degrees Celsius is 91.43.

The enthalpy at 32 degrees Celsius is 94.39.
