Energy Balance:
The derivative with respect to time of the sum of the mass flow rate times the enthalpy plus half the square of the momentum, plus the heat flow rate plus the work done by the system is given by:
\[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum \left( \dot{m}_i h_i + \frac{p_i^2}{2} \right) \right) + \dot{Q} + \dot{W}_a \]

The equation zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between two states plus the heat transfer, where the heat transfer is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy between the same two states:
\[ 0 = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_{ab}, \quad \dot{Q}_{ab} = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_2) \]

The enthalpy at state 2 is a function of the reference temperature:
\[ h_2 = h_2 (T_0, \]
