The graph is described as a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The y-axis is labeled T with the unit Kelvin. The x-axis is labeled s with the unit kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. There are three isobars labeled p0, pB, and pS from bottom to top. The graph displays a cycle with six states labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The process moves from state 0 to 1, then to 2, 3, 4, 5, and back to 0. The paths between states are marked with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
