The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as S in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled as T in Kelvin. The graph consists of six points labeled P0, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6. The process between these points is described as follows:
- From P0 to P2: Isentropic process, represented by a vertical line.
- From P2 to P3: Isobaric process, represented by a horizontal line.
- From P3 to P4: Isentropic process, represented by a vertical line.
- From P4 to P5: Isobaric process, represented by a horizontal line with a pressure of 0.5 bar.
- From P5 to P6: Isentropic process, represented by a vertical line, but in the reversed direction.
- From P6 to P0: Isobaric process, represented by a horizontal line.
