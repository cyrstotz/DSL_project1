The temperature of the condenser, denoted as T subscript KF, is equal to the fraction where the numerator is the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet of the condenser, h subscript KF,aus, and the enthalpy at the inlet of the condenser, h subscript KF,ein. The denominator is the difference between the entropy at the outlet of the condenser, s subscript KF,aus, and the entropy at the inlet of the condenser, s subscript KF,ein.
