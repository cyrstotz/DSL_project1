The equation for epsilon sub k is given by epsilon sub k equals the ratio of Q dot sub zu over the difference of Q dot ab minus Q dot zu, which equals the ratio of Q dot sub k over W dot sub k, which equals 2.0836, which is equal to epsilon sub k.

Q dot sub k equals m dot times the difference of h sub 2 minus h sub 1.

This is calculated as the ratio of 1.9667 times 10 to the power of negative 4 kilograms per second over 2.6068 times 10 to the power of negative 4 kilograms per second, multiplied by the difference of 249.53 kilojoules per kilogram minus 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 0.029765 kilojoules per second, which is equal to Q dot sub k.

Q dot sub k equals 41.6718 Joules per second.

This is equal to 0.0416718 kilojoules per second, which is equal to Q dot sub k.
