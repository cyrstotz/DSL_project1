The mass flow rate m with subscript 23/34 is to be calculated. The heat transfer rate Q with subscript K equals the mass flow rate m times the difference between h2 and h3, derived from the energy balance for a steady flow process.

For the calculations in section 4.c:
- X subscript l is defined but not given a specific value initially.
- T subscript l is given as 10 degrees Celsius and S subscript l equals S subscript f, leading to S subscript f being (86 Joules per kilogram Kelvin, x equals 0).
- X subscript l is calculated as (S subscript l minus S subscript f) divided by (S subscript g minus S subscript f).
- S subscript f at 10 degrees Celsius is calculated using interpolation from Table A.10, resulting in 0.24495.
- S subscript g is calculated similarly, resulting in 0.81441.
- X subscript l is then calculated to be approximately 0.15086.

In section 4.d:
- The efficiency epsilon subscript K is calculated as Phi subscript zu divided by W subscript fs, and the result is underlined as 1500.
