The pressure \( p_{2g} \) equals \( p_{1g} \) because the mass of the ice, which still has changed the weight.

The temperature \( T_{2g} \).

The mole fraction of ice \( x_{n,eis} \) is 0.6.

The volume \( V_2 \) is calculated as \( \frac{m_{eis} RT_2}{p} \).

This equals \( \frac{0.00342 \times 166.28 \, \text{Joules per Kelvin}}{1.401 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pascals}} \).

Which results in \( 0.00116 \, \text{cubic meters} \).
