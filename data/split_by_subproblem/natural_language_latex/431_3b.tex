b)

The expression \( p_{3,2} = p_{3,1} \) states that \( p_{3,2} \) equals \( p_{3,1} \) because no additional force is added, and thus the balance of forces does not change.

The expression \( T_{3,2} = T_{Ew,1} \) states that \( T_{3,2} \) equals \( T_{Ew,1} \) because if the boiler is greater than zero, there must be ice in the equilibrium water, and thus the temperature cannot increase. Since the gas in the equilibrium water is in thermodynamic equilibrium, the temperatures must be the same.
