W6, T6, 1HS incomplete turbine.
Statistical Theta equals the rugged (h0 minus h6 plus (omega0 squared minus omega6 squared) divided by 2) plus Q dot minus W dot.
0 equals h0 minus h6 plus (omega0 squared minus omega6 squared) divided by 2.
Minus (omega6 squared plus omega6 squared) divided by 2 equals h6 minus h6, which implies 2 times (h0 minus h6) equals minus omega6 squared plus omega6 squared.
W6 equals the square root of (2 times (h0 minus h6) plus omega6 squared).
Equals the square root of (2cp times (T0 minus T6) plus omega6 squared).
From 5 to 6, adjusted reversible, s_rev minus s_6s equals 0.
Implies adjusted reversible isentropic, k equals 1.4.
T6 over T5 equals (p6 over p5) raised to the power of ((k minus 1) divided by k).
T6 equals T5 times (p6 over p5) raised to the power of ((k minus 1) divided by k).
T6 equals 328.094 Kelvin.
W6 equals the square root of (2cp times (T0 times (T6 over T0)) plus omega6 squared) equals the square root of (2 times 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (30 squared minus 273.15 plus 328.094) plus 200 meters squared per second squared).
W6 equals 453.202 meters per second.
