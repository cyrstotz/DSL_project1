The graph description is as follows: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( p(\text{bar}) \) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T [K] \). The vertical axis has an arrow pointing upwards, and the horizontal axis has an arrow pointing to the right. There is a curve starting from point 1 on the upper left, moving downwards and to the right, and ending at point 2 on the lower right. This curve is labeled "Isotherme". There are two segments marked on the curve: segment \( i \) from point 1 to an intermediate point, and segment \( ii \) from the intermediate point to point 2. Segment \( i \) is indicated with a solid line, while segment \( ii \) is indicated with a dashed line. Point 1 is labeled at the top left of the curve, and point 2 is labeled at the bottom right of the curve. The intermediate point is labeled with a small circle and the letter \( G \).

The characteristics of the segments are:
- Segment \( i \) is isobaric with a decrease in temperature (\(\Delta T < 0\)).
- Segment \( ii \) is isothermal.
