The equation is as follows:

T equals the fraction where the numerator is the integral from S_e to S_a of T ds, and the denominator is S_a minus S_e. This is equal to the fraction where the numerator is the integral from T_1 to T_2 of T ds, and the denominator is the natural logarithm of T_a over T_e.

This simplifies to the fraction where the numerator is e times the difference T_a minus T_e, and the denominator is the natural logarithm of T_a over T_e. Further simplifying, it becomes the fraction where the numerator is T_a minus T_e, and the denominator is the natural logarithm of T_a over T_e, which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
