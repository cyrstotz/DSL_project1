Change in internal energy, denoted as Delta U, equals Q12 minus W12. The internal energy at state A2, denoted as U_A2, equals Q_A2 minus W_A2,v, which simplifies to Q_A2 equals U_A2 plus W_12,v. The expression for U_A2 is given by the product of mass m, specific heat at constant volume c_V, and the temperature difference T2 minus T1, which equals m times 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference between 273.15 Kelvin and 773.15 Kelvin. This results in negative 3.16 times 4.98 kilojoules per kilogram times 2.29 kilograms per m_g,1, which equals negative 92.496 Joules.

The work done W_12,v is calculated as mass m times the integral of pressure p with respect to volume dv, which equals m times the gas constant R times the temperature difference T2 minus T1 divided by 1 minus n, where n is the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure c_p to specific heat at constant volume c_v, approximately equal to 1.263. The value of c_p is calculated as R plus c_v, which equals R divided by molar mass M plus c_v, resulting in approximately 0.799 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The expression for W_12,v is further calculated as 0.00292 kilograms times the fraction 0.166 times the temperature difference 273.15 Kelvin minus 773.15 Kelvin divided by 1 minus 1.263, resulting in 92.496 Joules.

Finally, Q_12 is calculated as negative 92.496 Joules plus 92.496 Joules, resulting in 0 Joules.
