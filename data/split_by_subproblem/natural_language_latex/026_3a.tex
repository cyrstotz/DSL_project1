The expression for \( p_{g1} \) is given by the sum of \( p_{amb} \), the product of \( m_c \), \( g \), and \( h \) divided by \( A \), plus the product of \( m_{eng} \), \( g \), and \( h \) divided by \( A \).

The area \( A \) is calculated as \( \pi \) times the square of \( D \) divided by 4, which equals \( 7.85 \times 10^{-3} \) square meters.

The value of \( p_{g1} \) is \( 3.473 \) bar, and this value is boxed.

The value of \( p_{gn} \) is \( 1.1 \) bar, and this value is also boxed.

The ratio of \( p_{g1} \) times \( V_{g1} \) divided by \( R \) times \( T_{g1} \) equals \( 3.429 \), which is equal to \( mg \), and this result is underlined.

The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as \( \bar{R} \) divided by \( M_g \), which equals \( 0.16628 \).
