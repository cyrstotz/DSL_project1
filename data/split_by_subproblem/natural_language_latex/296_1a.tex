The rate of heat output, denoted as Q-dot with subscript "aus" (out), equals the rate of heat input, denoted as Q-dot with subscript "R", minus the product of the mass flow rate in, denoted as m-dot with subscript "ein" (in), and the difference between the specific enthalpy out, denoted as h with subscript "aus" (out), and the specific enthalpy in, denoted as h with subscript "ein" (in).

This is calculated as the rate of heat input, Q-dot with subscript "R", minus the mass flow rate in, m-dot with subscript "ein", equals 100 kilowatts minus 42.08 kilowatts, which equals 57.92 kilowatts.

The mass flow rate in, m-dot with subscript "ein", is 0.3 kilograms per second.

The specific enthalpy in, h with subscript "ein", is 1027.0 kilojoules per kilogram.

The specific enthalpy out, h with subscript "aus", is 1107.6 kilojoules per kilogram.
