The graph is drawn on grid paper with the x-axis labeled as 's' and the y-axis unlabeled. It includes several curves and points:
- Point 0 at the origin.
- Point 1 slightly above and to the right of point 0.
- Point 2 above and to the right of point 1.
- Point 3 above and to the right of point 2.
- Point 6 below and to the right of point 1.
- Point 9 above and to the right of point 6.
- A curve labeled "rev." connects points 0, 1, and 2.
- A curve connects points 2 and 3.
- A curve connects points 3 and 9.
- A curve connects points 9 and 6.
- A curve connects points 6 and 1.
- A curve connects points 1 and 0.
- Several isobaric lines labeled "30 bar", "50 bar", and "70 bar" run roughly parallel to each other and slope upwards to the right.
