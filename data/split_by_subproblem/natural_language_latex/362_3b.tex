Since \(x = 0\) and \(T\) is homogeneous throughout the container, \(T_{12}\) must be \(0^\circ \text{C}\) at a constant \(1.1 \, \text{bar}\).
- In the second phase region, at \(p = \text{const} = 1.1 \, \text{bar}\), the temperature is against \(0^\circ \text{C}\) according to the table.
The pressure also remains constant, since \(p_{\text{amb}}\) and \(m_{12} = \text{const}\).

State 1

The mass of the ice water \(m_{\text{EW}}\) is \(0.1 \, \text{kg}\).

The fraction of ice \(x_{\text{Eis}}\) is the mass of ice \(m_{\text{Eis}}\) divided by the mass of the ice water \(m_{\text{EW}}\), which equals \(0.6\).

The temperature \(T\) is \(0^\circ \text{C}\).

Energy balance around ice water with \(Q_{zw} = 1082.14 \, \text{J}\):

The change in internal energy \(\Delta U\) equals \(Q_{zw}\) because the external work \(EP\) is zero.

The internal energy at state 1 \(U_1\) is \(x\) times \([U_{\text{Eis}}(0^\circ \text{C})]\) plus \(x\) times \((U_g - U_f)\) Joules times the mass of the ice water \(m_{\text{EW}}\), which equals \(20 \, \text{J}\).

The internal energy at state 2 \(U_2\) is \(Q_{zw} + U_1\) equals \(-1082.14 \, \text{J}\).

The fraction \(x\) is \((U_2 - U_f) / (U_g - U_f)\).

The internal energy at state 1 \(U_1\) is \(0.1 \, \text{kg}\) times \((-333.458 + x \times (-0.045 + 333.458))\), which equals \(-13.34 \, \text{J}\).

The internal energy at state 2 \(U_2\) is \(U_1 + Q_{zw}\) equals \(-12.25 \, \text{J}\).

Thus, \(x\) equals \((U_2 - U_{\text{ref}}) / (U_{\text{mess}} - U_{\text{ref}})\) equals \(0.963\).
