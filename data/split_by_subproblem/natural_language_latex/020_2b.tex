Adiabatically reversible implies isentropic.

This implies the ratio of T2 over T1 equals the ratio of P2 over P1 raised to the power of (k-1) over k, which also implies the ratio of T6 over T5 equals the ratio of P6 over P5 raised to the power of (k-1) over k, which further implies that P6 equals P0 equals 0.191 bar.

T6 equals 431.9 Kelvin, and calculating using the ratio of 0.191 bar over 0.5 bar raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1) over 1.4 equals 328.1 Kelvin.

This leads to wc.
