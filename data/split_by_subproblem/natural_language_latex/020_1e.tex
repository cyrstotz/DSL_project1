e) The change in entropy between state 1 and state 2, denoted as Delta S_12, equals M_2 times the difference between entropy S_2 and S_1. This implies that S_1 equals the entropy at the saturated liquid state at 100 degrees Celsius, S_f (100 degrees Celsius), plus x_0 times the difference between the entropy at the saturated vapor state at 100 degrees Celsius, S_g (100 degrees Celsius), and S_f (100 degrees Celsius). This equals 7 from Table A2, which is 3.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin plus 0.005 times (7.3589 minus 3.3069) kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, resulting in 1.3374 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

S_2 equals the entropy at the saturated liquid state at 20 degrees Celsius, S_f (20 degrees Celsius), which is 0.3549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The mass of gas at state 2, M_2_gas, equals the mass of gas at state 1, M_1_gas, plus the change in mass from state 1 to state 2, Delta M_12, which is 5.755 kilograms plus 3600 grams, resulting in 9355 kilograms.

Therefore, the change in entropy from state 1 to state 2, Delta S_12, equals 9355 kilograms per second times the difference between 0.5549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and 1.3374 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, resulting in -3575 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
