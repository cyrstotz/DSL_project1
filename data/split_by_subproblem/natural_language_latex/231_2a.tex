- The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram.
- The x-axis is labeled S in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
- The y-axis is labeled T in Kelvin.
- There are two isobars labeled P1 and P2 with P2 being greater than P1.
- The process starts at a point on the lower isobar P1, moves vertically up to the upper isobar P2 through a process labeled "compressor".
- From the upper isobar P2, the process moves rightward and slightly downward through a process labeled "isobaric heat addition".
- The process then moves downward to the lower isobar P1 through a process labeled "turbine".
- Finally, the process moves leftward and slightly downward back to the starting point on the lower isobar P1 through a process labeled "constant temperature".
