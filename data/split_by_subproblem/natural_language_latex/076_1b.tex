The average temperature T_KF is given by the formula:

T_KF bar equals the integral from S1 to S2 of T ds divided by S2 minus S1, which equals q12, rev divided by S2 minus S1, which equals h2 minus h1 divided by S2 minus S1.

The values of T1 and T2 are given as:

T1 equals 288.15

T2 equals 238.15

In the given process:

h2 minus h1 equals the integral from T1 to T2 of ci dT plus vi times (beta p0), which simplifies to ci times (T2 minus T1).

S2 minus S1 equals ci times the natural logarithm of (T2 divided by T1).

Substituting these into the formula for T_KF bar, we get:

T_KF bar equals (T2 minus T1) divided by the natural logarithm of (T2 divided by T1), which equals (238.15 minus 288.15) divided by the natural logarithm of (238.15 divided by 288.15), which equals 293.12 Kelvin.
