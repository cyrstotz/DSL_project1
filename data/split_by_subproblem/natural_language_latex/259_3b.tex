The pressure \( p_{g1} \) is 7.5 bar and the mass \( m_{g} \) is 3.6 grams.

The temperature \( T_{g1} \) is 0 degrees Celsius.

The ratio of \( T_2 \) to \( T_1 \) is equal to the ratio of \( p_2 \) to \( p_1 \) raised to the power of \( \frac{n-1}{n} \).

The expression \( \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \) is equal to the ratio of \( T_2 \) to \( T_1 \) times the ratio of \( p_2 \) to \( p_1 \) raised to the power of \( \frac{n-1}{n} \).

The pressure \( p_2 \) is equal to the ratio of \( T_2 \) to \( T_1 \) raised to the power of \( \frac{n}{n-1} \) times \( p_1 \).

The value of \( n \) is the ratio of \( c_p^{ig} \) to \( c_v^{ig} \), which is \( \frac{0.63976}{0.6} = 1.066 \).

The gas constant \( R \) is equal to \( c_p^{ig} \) minus \( c_v^{ig} \), which is also \( R + c_v^{ig} \).

The specific heat at constant pressure \( c_p^{ig} \) is 0.63976.

The value of \( n \) is \( \frac{0.63976}{0.633} = 1.00025 \).

The temperature is the same as that of ice, since the temperature of ice cannot change with X 270.
