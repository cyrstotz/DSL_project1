Graph Description:

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled as temperature in Kelvin. There are two curves on the graph:

1. The first curve starts at point 5, goes upwards and to the right, and ends at point 6. This curve is labeled as the pressure at point 5 equals the pressure at point 6.
2. The second curve starts at point 6, goes upwards and to the right, and ends at point 7. This curve is labeled as the pressure at point 7 equals the pressure at point 8.

There are arrows indicating the direction of the process along the curves. The points are connected by vertical lines indicating constant pressure processes.
