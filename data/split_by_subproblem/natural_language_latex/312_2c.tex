The equation crossed out O equals the rate of specific exergy at the start minus the rate of specific exergy at state 6.

The change in specific exergy, denoted as Delta e subscript x, str, equals the specific exergy at state 6 minus the specific exergy at state 0, which is equal to h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus the difference of w subscript 6 squared minus w subscript 0 squared all over 2.

This is further simplified to c subscript p times (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) minus c subscript p times T subscript 0 times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T subscript 6 to T subscript 0 minus R subscript L, oft times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p subscript 6 to p subscript 0 plus T subscript 0 over 2 times the difference of w subscript 6 squared minus w subscript 0 squared all over 2.

w subscript 0 equals w subscript L, oft, which is 200 meters per second.

This results in 68.45 kilojoules per kilogram.
