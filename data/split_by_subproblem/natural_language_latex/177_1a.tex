Lambda HS:

The equation zero equals m dot times the difference of h1 and h2 plus Q dot R minus Q dot aus.

Q dot aus equals Q dot R plus m dot times the difference of h1 and h2, which equals 62.12 kilowatts.

hf1, h1 equals hf at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

h2 equals hf at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.
