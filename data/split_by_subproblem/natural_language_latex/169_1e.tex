The rate of change of entropy S with respect to time t is equal to the mass flow rate m dot times the difference in entropy s1 minus s2, plus the sum of the heat transfer rate Q dot divided by the temperature T, plus the generated entropy rate s dot subscript erz.

The change in entropy S from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the change in mass from state 1 to state 2 times the difference in entropy s1 minus s2, plus the heat transfer rate Q dot divided by the temperature T, plus the generated entropy rate s dot subscript erz.

This equals the change in mass from state 1 to state 2 times the difference in entropy s1 minus s2.

The difference in entropy s1 minus s2 is equal to the integral from temperature T2 to T1 of the specific heat capacity c divided by the temperature T with respect to T, which simplifies to c times the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature T1 to T2.
