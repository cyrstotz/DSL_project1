Item b)
The temperature \( T_{g2} \) is \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) which equals \( 273.15 \, \text{K} \).
Since \( x_{Ew,2} > 0 \), the temperature of the dew point in state 2 is \( 0^\circ \text{C} \). Since state 2 is already the equilibrium state (final state), the temperature of the gas is the same as that of the dew point, which is \( 0^\circ \text{C} \).
The pressure \( p_{g2} \) is equal to \( p_{g1} \) and is \( 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).
Since the mass mentioned above remains unchanged, the pressure must remain the same so that the gas can "carry" the mass, i.e., remain in equilibrium state.
