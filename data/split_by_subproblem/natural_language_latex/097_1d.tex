Required: Change in mass, denoted as Delta m_12.

The change in energy, Delta E, equals the product of Delta m_12 and h_12, plus the sum of heat transfer Q_12, minus the sum of work W_n (gap here).

The equation m_2 times u_dot_2 minus m_1 times u_dot_1 equals Delta m_12 times h_12 plus Q_dot_R.

The expression m_2 times u_dot_2 minus m_1 times u_dot_1 is shown with an arrow pointing downwards to the fraction (m_2 minus m_1) divided by (m_2 times h_2 minus m_1 times h_1) times (h_2 minus h_1).

The heat transfer Q_12 equals negative 35 Mega Joules.
The mass m_1 equals 5285 kilograms.

The internal energy u_1 at a dryness fraction x_b equals 0.0005, at 20 degrees Celsius.
