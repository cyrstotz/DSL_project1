The mass of the ice-water mixture is 0.1 kilograms, the initial temperature is 0 degrees Celsius, and the quality (fraction of mass that is steam) is 0.6, denoted as ice.

Energy balance for a closed system:

The heat transfer Q from state 1 to state 2 is 1500 Joules.

The heat transfer Q from state 1 to state 2 is equal to the mass times the difference in internal energy between state 1 and state 2.

The internal energy at state 1, with a quality of 0.6 and temperature of 0 degrees Celsius, is -200.093 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy at state 2 is calculated as the heat transfer divided by the mass minus the internal energy at state 1.

This results in 15 times 200.1.

To interpolate over u2 for T2:

The temperature T2 is calculated as the temperature at the lower bound plus the ratio of the difference between the higher and lower temperatures to the difference between the higher and lower internal energies, multiplied by the difference between u2 and the internal energy at the lower bound.
