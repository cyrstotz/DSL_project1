Since all the heat \(Q_{12}\) flows into the process of melting ice and there is still ice remaining at the end, it holds that the temperature \(T_{2, \text{ice}} = 0^\circ C\) and thus also \(T_{2, \text{gas}} = 0^\circ C\) (since 4th thermodynamic equilibrium). The pressure remains constant in this configuration!

The pressure \( p_{3g} \) equals 1.4 bar.
