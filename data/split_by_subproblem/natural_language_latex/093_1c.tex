c) The temperature \( T_a \) is equal to the temperature \( T_e \) times the exponential of the fraction \((S_a - S_e)\) over \(c_{if}\), which equals 291.63 Kelvin.

Entropy balance for stationary heat pump:
The equation is zero equals the mass flow rate in times entropy in minus the mass flow rate out times entropy out plus the heat flow rate residual times the reciprocal of the temperature \(T_{KF}\).

The sum of the residual heat flow rate and the residual entropy flow rate equals zero.

The entropy in \( S_{ein} \) is 0.954 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy out \( S_{aus} \) is 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The residual entropy flow rate \( \dot{S}_{res} \) is equal to the difference between entropy out and entropy in times the mass flow rate in minus the residual heat flow rate over the temperature \(T_{KF}\).

This results in \(-0.498\) kilowatts per Kelvin.
