The heat transferred, denoted as Q, is equal to the negative change in energy, which is also equal to the change in internal energy, represented as the difference between the internal energy at state 2 and state 1, U_G,2 minus U_G,1.

This is further calculated as the specific heat at constant volume, c_v, times the difference in temperature, T_2 minus T_1, times the mass, m. Substituting the values, the specific heat at constant volume is 0.635 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, the mass is 0.0342 kilograms, and the change in temperature is negative 50 Kelvin.

The absolute value of the heat transferred from state 1 to state 2, denoted as |Q_12|, is underlined and equals 1.0829 kilojoules.
