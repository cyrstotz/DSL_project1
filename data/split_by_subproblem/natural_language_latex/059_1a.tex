Zero equals the mass flow rate in times the enthalpy in minus the mass flow rate out times the enthalpy out minus the heat flow rate out plus the heat flow rate R. The heat flow rate out equals the mass flow rate in times the enthalpy in minus the mass flow rate out times the enthalpy out plus the heat flow rate R. The heat flow rate out equals the mass flow rate in times the difference of enthalpy in and enthalpy out plus the heat flow rate R. The enthalpy in equals h_f of 750 which is 292.38 kilojoules per kilogram. The enthalpy out equals 413.04 (from TABLE 2). The heat flow rate out equals 0.3 times the difference of 292.38 and 413.04 plus 100, which results in 62.182 kilowatts.
