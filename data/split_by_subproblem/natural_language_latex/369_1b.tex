The average temperature for the ideal fluid, where pressure is constant in brackets, is given by the formula:

T-bar subscript KF equals the integral of T ds divided by (s subscript e minus s subscript a).

For an ideal fluid, the change in enthalpy per unit entropy change is given by:

(h subscript e minus h subscript a) divided by (s subscript e minus s subscript a) equals (c subscript p times (T subscript aus minus T subscript ein)) divided by (c subscript p times the natural logarithm of (T subscript aus divided by T subscript ein)) equals (T subscript aus minus T subscript ein) divided by the natural logarithm of (T subscript aus divided by T subscript ein).

Calculating with specific temperatures:

(298.75 Kelvin minus 288.75 Kelvin) divided by the natural logarithm of (298.75 Kelvin divided by 288.75 Kelvin) equals 293.22 Kelvin.
