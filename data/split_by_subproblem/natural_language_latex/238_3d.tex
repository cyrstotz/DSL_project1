The mass of the gas times the difference between the internal energy of ice at state 2 and the internal energy of gas at state 1 equals negative Q.

The internal energy of gas at state 1 equals the internal energy of liquid at 1 bar plus x of ice times the difference between the internal energy of solid at 1 bar and the internal energy of liquid at 1 bar.

The internal energy of liquid at 1 bar equals negative 0.045 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy of solid at 1 bar equals 333.458 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy at state 1 equals negative 200.0928 kilojoules per kilogram.

The mass of the gas times the internal energy of ice at state 2 equals Q times the mass of the gas equals negative 18.875 kilojoules.

The internal energy of ice at state 2 equals negative 18.875 kilojoules per kilogram.

The x of ice at state 2 equals the ratio of the difference between the internal energy of ice at state 2 and the internal energy of liquid at 1 bar to the difference between the internal energy of solid at 1 bar and the internal energy of liquid at 1 bar, which equals 0.566.
