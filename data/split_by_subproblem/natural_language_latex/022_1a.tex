Item a) Energy balance:
The equation zero equals mass flow rate times the flow constant k_F times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance, plus the heat flow out minus the work done.

Energy balance for the reactor:
The equation zero equals the mass flow rate at the entrance times the difference between the enthalpy at the entrance and the enthalpy at the exit, plus the heat added to the reactor, plus the heat flow out, minus the work done.

The enthalpy at the entrance is equal to the enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius.
The enthalpy at the exit is equal to the enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius.
Refer to tables A1 to A6.

The enthalpy at the entrance is 292.38 micro Joules per kilogram Kelvin.
The enthalpy at the exit is 448.04 micro Joules per kilogram Kelvin.

The heat flow out is equal to the mass flow rate at the entrance times the difference between the enthalpy at the exit and the enthalpy at the entrance, plus the heat added to the reactor, which equals 137.818 kilowatts.
