The average temperature T-bar is equal to the integral from e to a of T ds, multiplied by the reciprocal of the difference between s-sub-a and s-sub-e.

This equals the fraction where the numerator is the product of T-sub-K,aus and s-sub-aus minus the product of T-sub-K,ein and s-sub-ein, and the denominator is the difference between s-sub-aus and s-sub-ein.
