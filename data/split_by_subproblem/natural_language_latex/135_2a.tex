Graph Description:

The graph is a Temperature (T) versus Entropy (s) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled T and the horizontal axis is labeled s. The graph consists of a cycle with six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by lines and curves as follows:

- Point 1 is at the bottom left.
- Point 2 is directly above point 1, connected by a vertical line labeled p equals 2 bar.
- Point 3 is to the right of point 2, connected by a curve.
- Point 4 is below point 3, connected by a vertical line.
- Point 5 is to the right of point 4, connected by a curve labeled isobar with 0.5 bar.
- Point 6 is below point 5, connected by a vertical line labeled isobar p equals 0.79 bar.
- Point 6 is connected back to point 1 by a curve.

The equation for the exergy loss is given by:
e subscript x, verl equals negative delta e subscript x, 0 plus (1 minus T subscript 0 over T bar subscript 0) times q subscript b

This equals 848.78 kilojoules per kilogram.

T bar subscript 0 equals 72.89 Kelvin and q subscript b equals 7705.
