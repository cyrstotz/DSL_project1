Subsection b)

Required in \( p_2 \)

The thermodynamic cycle:

The equation zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at point e and the enthalpy at point a, minus the heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{kj} \), minus the sum of the work transfer rates \( \dot{W}_{trm} \).

The equation zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at point 2 and the enthalpy at point 3, plus the heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{ab} \).

The equation for the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) equals the heat transfer rate \( \dot{Q}_{ab} \) divided by the difference between the enthalpy at point 2 and the enthalpy at point 3.

\( p_2 \) equals 1 bar.
