Process step 5-6 isentropic:
The temperature T6 equals Ts times the ratio of p6 over p5 raised to the power of (n-1) over n, which equals 431.9 Kelvin times the ratio of 0.194 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals over 0.5 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascals raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4, resulting in 328.07 Kelvin.

Energy balance at the thrust nozzle:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the quantity of he plus we squared over 2 minus ha minus wa squared over 2 plus Q dot.
Zero equals he minus ha plus we squared over 2 minus wa squared over 2.
he minus ha equals cp times the difference of Ts minus T6, which equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times the difference of 431.9 Kelvin minus 328.07 Kelvin, resulting in 104.45 kilojoules per kilogram.

Ideal gas:
Zero equals hs minus h6 plus ws squared over 2 minus w6 squared over 2.
Negative of hs minus h6 equals ws squared over 2 minus w6 squared over 2.
Negative of hs minus h6 equals half of ws squared minus w6 squared.
Negative two times hs minus h6 equals ws squared minus w6 squared.
ws squared equals w6 squared plus two times hs minus h6.
ws equals the square root of w6 squared plus two times hs minus h6, which equals the square root of 220 meters squared per second squared plus two times 104.45 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in 50.725 meters per second.
