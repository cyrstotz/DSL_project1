Phi equals phi sub e plus x times the difference of phi sub g and phi sub e, implies x equals the difference of phi and phi sub e divided by the difference of phi sub g and phi sub e.

X sub 1 equals the difference of h sub 2 and h sub e divided by the difference of h sub 3 and h sub p.

h sub 2 equals h sub 4 equals 0.342 (lambda equals 1), h sub p equals.

p sub 4 equals 8 bar.
