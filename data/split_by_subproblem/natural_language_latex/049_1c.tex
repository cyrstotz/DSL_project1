c) With the entropy balance we have:
The rate of heat transfer in equals the mass flow rate times the entropy at the inlet minus the net rate of heat transfer plus the entropy at the inlet, which implies that the entropy at the inlet equals the rate of heat transfer at the inlet divided by the temperature minus the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at the inlet and the entropy at the entry.
Where \(S_e\) and \(S_{\text{zu}}\) (entropy at the inlet) are also interpolated from Table A-2:
The entropy at the exit \(S_e\) equals the quality at state b times the entropy of the vapor at temperature 70 degrees Celsius plus one minus the quality at state b times the entropy of the fluid at temperature 70 degrees Celsius, which equals 0.9889.
The entropy at the inlet \(S_{\text{zu}}\) equals the quality at state b times the entropy of the vapor at temperature 100 degrees Celsius plus one minus the quality at state b times the entropy of the fluid at temperature 100 degrees Celsius, which equals 1.33719.
This implies that the difference between the entropy at the inlet and 62.299 divided by 285 plus 0.3 times 0.9889 is approximately 211.18 kilograms per kilogram.
