c) Entropy balance

Closed System:
The change in entropy, Delta S, equals the entropy at the end, S_e, minus the entropy at the beginning, S_a, plus the generated entropy, S_erz.
The square of the change in entropy, Delta S squared, equals the sum of the heat transfer rate, Q_j dot, divided by the temperature, T_j, plus the generated entropy, S_erz.

Q_aus:
The generated entropy, S_erz, equals negative the heat transfer rate out, Q_aus dot, times the difference between the reciprocal of the reference temperature, T_R, and the reciprocal of the temperature, T, which equals negative 65 kilowatts times the difference between the reciprocal of 373.15 Kelvin and the reciprocal of 275 Kelvin.
This results in 0.04615 plus 46.15 Joules per kilogram.
