- The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram.
- The x-axis is labeled as T (Temperature).
- The y-axis is labeled as p (Pressure).
- There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 forming a cycle.
- Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is directly above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, and point 4 is directly below point 3.
- The region between points 1 and 2 is labeled as Q equals 0.
- The region between points 3 and 4 is labeled as Q equals 0.
- The region between points 2 and 3 is labeled as "Wet steam region".
- The region between points 1 and 4 is labeled as p equals constant.
