Question about x_2.

The temperature T_S2 is 0.003 degrees Celsius.

The mass m_S is 3.6 grams.

The pressure P_S2 is 1.5 bar.

The formula for x_2 is given as:
x_2 equals (u minus u_f) divided by (u_g minus u_f).

Substituting values into the formula:
(333.4 kilojoules per kilogram minus 0) divided by (-333.4 kilojoules per kilogram) equals 1.

Repeating the formula for x_2:
x_2 equals (u minus u_f) divided by (u_g minus u_f).

Calculating x_2 with different values:
(-333.4) divided by (-333.4 plus 0.83) equals approximately 0.998877.
