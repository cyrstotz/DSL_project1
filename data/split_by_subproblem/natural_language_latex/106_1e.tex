The change in entropy, denoted as Delta S_12, is equal to m_2 times s_2 minus m_1 times s_1, which equals 64.755 joules per kilogram Kelvin.

The mass m_1 is 5.755 kilograms.

The mass m_2 is equal to m_1 plus Delta m_12, which results in 9.355 kilograms.

The entropy s_2 at 70 degrees Celsius and x equals 1 is 7.7553 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy s_1 at 200 degrees Celsius and x equals 0.005 is equal to s_f plus x times (s_g minus s_f), which results in 1.337 plus 14 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
