p naught equals p three, indicating that the pressure at point zero is equal to the pressure at point three, and this is for a thrust nozzle that is adiabatic and reversible.

T four equals T five times the ratio of p four over p five raised to the power of (n minus one) over n.

T four equals underlined 328.07 Kelvin.

Zero equals h subscript e minus h subscript a plus the fraction of w subscript e squared minus w subscript a squared, all over two.

C equals C subscript p times (T two minus T a) plus the fraction of w subscript e squared minus w subscript a squared, all over two.

w subscript e equals underlined 503.23 meters per second.
