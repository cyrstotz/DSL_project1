The energy E_k is equal to the ratio of the heat input rate dot Q_zu to the absolute value of the power output rate dot w_s, which equals the ratio of the heat output rate dot Q_k to dot Q_k minus the ratio of an empty numerator to 25 kilowatts.

The heat output rate dot Q_k equals negative dot m times (the - ha), which equals negative 4 kilograms per hour.
