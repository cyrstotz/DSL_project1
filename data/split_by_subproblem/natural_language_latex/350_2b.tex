Energy balance at 5-6:

Determine T6 via polytropic exponent.

The pressure difference p6 minus p0 equals 0.191 bar.

T6 equals T5 times (p6 over p5) raised to the power of (1.9 minus 1) divided by 1.9, which equals 328.07 Kelvin, equals T6.

Energy balance over 5-6; Stationary FP:

m times (h5 minus h6 plus (220 squared minus u6 squared) over 2) equals zero, to be crossed out.

h5 minus h6 plus (220 squared over 2) minus (u6 squared over 2) equals zero.

u6 equals the square root of (2 times 128.653).

u6 equals 507.25 meters per second.

h5 minus h6 plus (220 squared over 2) equals (u6 squared over 2).

1.006 times 1000 times (431.9 minus 328.07) plus (220 squared over 2) equals (u6 squared over 2) equals 128,651.98.
