The graph is described as a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with entropy in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled with temperature in Kelvin. The graph features a closed loop with six points labeled 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each process between consecutive points, specifically from point 0 to 2, from 2 to 3, from 3 to 4, from 4 to 5, from 5 to 6, and from 6 back to 0, is described as an isobaric process, meaning the pressure remains constant during these processes. The pressure at point 5 is specified as 0.5 bar, and the pressure at point 6 is given as the pressure at point 0 minus 0.1 bar.
