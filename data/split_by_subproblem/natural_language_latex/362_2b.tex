The section discusses a thrust box described as adiabatically reversible:
- The pressure \( p_s \) is 0.5 bar.
- The initial temperature \( T_1 \) is 431.1 Kelvin.
- The pressure \( p_6 \) is 0.1 bar.
- The temperature \( T_6 \) is calculated using the formula \( T_6 = T_1 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_s} \right)^{\frac{k-1}{k}} \) and results in 328.07 Kelvin.
- The energy balance of the flow process, which is adiabatic, is considered.
- The work rate \( \dot{W}_t \) is given by \( \dot{W}_t = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a + \frac{w_{c2}^2 - w_{c1}^2}{2} \right] \).
- The work rate \( \dot{W}_t \) is also expressed as an integral from state 1 to 6, \( \dot{W}_t = \int_{1}^{6} v \, dp \), and specifically from state 5 to 6 as \( \int_{5}^{6} \frac{R T}{p} \, dp \).
