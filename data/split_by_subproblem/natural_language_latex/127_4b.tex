Energy balance in the compressor:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy from state 2 to state 1, plus the heat transfer rate minus the work done by the compressor.

Energy balance in the throttle:
Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference in enthalpy from state 4 to state 3.
The enthalpy at state 4 equals the enthalpy at state 1.
The pressure at state 4 equals the pressure at state 3.

The entropy at state 2 equals 0.9066 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The enthalpy at state 3 under isobaric conditions equals 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram.

1) The mass flow rate of refrigerant equals 4 kilograms per hour, the temperature at state 2 is minus 22 degrees Celsius, and the entropy at state 1 equals the saturation entropy.

The internal energy equals the saturation enthalpy, and at 80 centimeters, the internal energy equals the saturation enthalpy, referring to Table A-11, alpha 2 kilograms per kilogram.

x equals the difference between the internal energy and the saturation enthalpy at pressures P1 and temperatures T1, divided by the difference between the gas enthalpy and the saturation enthalpy at pressures P1 and temperatures T1.

The equation simplifies to the difference between the internal entropy and the saturation entropy at pressures P1 and temperatures T1, divided by an unspecified denominator.
