The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as S in kilojoules per Kelvin and the y-axis is labeled as T in Kelvin.

There are six points labeled from 1 to 6, connected by various processes:
- The process from Point 1 to Point 2 is labeled as "isobar".
- The process from Point 2 to Point 3 is labeled as "isobar".
- The process from Point 3 to Point 4 is labeled as "isentrope".
- The process from Point 4 to Point 5 is labeled as "isobar".
- The process from Point 5 to Point 6 is labeled as "isentrope".
- The process from Point 6 to Point 1 is labeled as "isobar".

Additional labels include:
- "p equals 0.5 bar" near the top right.
- "p0 equals 0.99 bar" near the middle right.
- Labels "isobar" and "isentrope" along the respective process lines.
- "M" and "m" near the middle of the graph.
- "Braking curve" near the top left.
