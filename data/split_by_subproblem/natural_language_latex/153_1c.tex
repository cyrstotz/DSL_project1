The change in the modified enthalpy, dH-hat, equals T times ds plus V times dp, since the rate of change of volume, v-dot, does not change.

The rate of change of enthalpy, H-dot, equals the mass flow rate, m-dot, times the integral of s with respect to ds.

The rate of change of temperature, T-dot, equals the rate of heat transfer out, Q-dot-out, divided by the difference between the entropy out, s-out, and the entropy in, s-in. This is equal to Q-dot-out divided by m-dot times the difference between s-out and s-in, which is equal to Q-dot-out divided by m-dot times the integral from the temperature in, T-in, to the temperature out, T-out, of c_p over T dT. This simplifies to Q-dot-out divided by m-dot times c_p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T-out to T-in. Finally, this equals the difference between T-out and T-in divided by c_p times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T-out to T-in, which equals 293.42.
