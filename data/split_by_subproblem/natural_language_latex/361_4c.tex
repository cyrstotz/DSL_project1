In the steady flow process, the equation mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at entrance equals zero is given by:

\[ \dot{m} (h_e - h_a) = 0 \]

It is stated that the enthalpy at entrance equals the enthalpy at exit equals the enthalpy at fluid state at 8 bar, which is 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram:

\[ h_a = h_e = h_f (8 \text{bar}) = 93.42 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \]

The temperature at fluid state equals the temperature at exit, which is 70 degrees Celsius:

\[ T_f = T_e = 70^\circ C \]

The enthalpy of vaporization is given as 233.74:

\[ h_{fg} = 233.74 \]

The calculation for enthalpy at fluid state is shown as:

\[ h_f = 93.48 - 23.77 = (-16 + x \cdot 8) + 23.77 = 29.3 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \]

Finally, the value of x is calculated as:

\[ x = \frac{93.42 - 29.3}{233.74 - 29.3} = 0.3076 \]
