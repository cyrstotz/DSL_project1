The graph description is as follows: The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as S and the y-axis labeled as h in units of kilojoules per kilogram. There are six points labeled 1 through 6. These points are connected by lines forming a cycle. The line connecting points 1 and 2 is vertical. The line connecting points 2 and 3 is curved and labeled "isobaric". The line connecting points 3 and 4 is horizontal. The line connecting points 4 and 5 is curved. The line connecting points 5 and 6 is vertical. There is a horizontal line labeled P0 below point 6. The points are connected in the following manner:
- Point 1 to Point 2 with a vertical line
- Point 2 to Point 3 with a curved line labeled "isobaric"
- Point 3 to Point 4 with a horizontal line
- Point 4 to Point 5 with a curved line
- Point 5 to Point 6 with a vertical line
