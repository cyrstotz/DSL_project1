Delta e subscript x, istr equals e subscript x, istr, 6 minus e subscript x, istr, 0.

This equals h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus Delta ke.

This equals c subscript p to the power of infinity times (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript 0 times (c subscript p to the power of infinity times the natural logarithm of (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) minus R times the natural logarithm of (P subscript 6 divided by P subscript 0)) plus (w subscript e2 squared divided by 2) minus (w subscript a2 squared divided by 2) plus Delta ke.

This equals c subscript p to the power of infinity times (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript 0 times c subscript p to the power of infinity times the natural logarithm of (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) plus R times T subscript 0 times the natural logarithm of (P subscript 0 divided by P subscript 6) plus (w subscript e2 squared divided by 2).
