The temperature \( T_{g2} \) is 0 degrees Celsius because \( Es \) is still present and in equilibrium \( T_{ev} = T_g \).

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) equals \( p_{g,1} \) which is 140100 Pascals because the force counteracting the pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is still the same (atmospheric pressure \( p_{atmos} \), \( m_k \), and \( m_{ev} \) are still the same).
