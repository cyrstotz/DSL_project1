The average temperature T with subscript "re" is equal to the integral of T dS divided by the difference between S subscript a and S subscript e.

T dS equals the integral of dQ, which is cancelled out.

Under the conditions where heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) and pressure (p) are constant,

S subscript a minus S subscript e equals Cp times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T2 to T1 minus R times the natural logarithm of the ratio of p2 to p1.

The average temperature T is equal to Cp times the difference between T2 and T1 divided by Cp times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T2 to T1.

Because Cp is constant,

The average temperature T equals Cp times the difference between T2 and T1 divided by Cp times the natural logarithm of the ratio of T2 to T1, which equals 10 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of the ratio of 293.15 to 283.15, resulting in 243.12 Kelvin.

This is equal to 19.97 degrees Celsius.
