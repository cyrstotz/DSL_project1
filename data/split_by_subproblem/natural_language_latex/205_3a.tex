- Diagram Description: The diagram shows a rectangular block labeled "EW" with a membrane at the bottom. There are three forces acting on the block: F_z acting upwards, F_1 acting downwards on the piston, and F_3 acting downwards on the membrane. The forces are labeled as follows:
  - F_z (upwards)
  - F_1 (downwards on the piston)
  - F_3 (downwards on the membrane)
  The block is labeled "Kolben" (piston) and "Membran" (membrane).

- The "EW" mixture is incompressible, therefore it is considered as a block.
- F_3 equals m_EW times g, which equals the gravitational force F_g of the "EW".
- Pressure p equals force F divided by area A, which gives units of Newtons per square meter, hence force F equals pressure p times area A.
- F_1 equals p_amp times A, where A equals pi times r squared, and r equals half of D, which is 5 cm.
- Diagram Description: A circle with radius r equals 0.05 meters is shown, and the area A equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters is calculated.
- F_2 equals m times g, representing the gravitational force of the weight on the piston.
- F_u equals p_0,1 times A, where p_0,1 equals 1.4 bar, resulting in F_3 equals 0.981 Newtons.
- F_z equals 785.398 Newtons.
- F_3 equals 343.92 Newtons.
