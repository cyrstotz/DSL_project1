The equation for c_k is given by c_k equals the fraction of Q_zu over dot V_t. 

Q_zu is calculated as dot m times the difference of h_2 minus h_1, which equals 0.658 times the difference of 239.62 minus 93.92, resulting in 90.9 watts.

Therefore, c_k equals the fraction of 90.9 over 28, which simplifies to approximately 3.2977.
