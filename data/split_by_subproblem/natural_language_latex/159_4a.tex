The description includes two graphs:

Graph 1: This graph is plotted with the x-axis labeled as T and the y-axis labeled as p. It features two horizontal dashed lines, one at p equals 5 millibar and another at p equals 0.9 millibar. There are two points labeled as (i) and (ii) on the graph. Point (i) is located at a higher temperature and pressure, while point (ii) is at a lower temperature and pressure. The graph displays a series of curves connecting these points, indicating some thermodynamic process.

Graph 2: This graph is plotted with the x-axis labeled as T and the y-axis labeled as p. It includes a single line that starts from the origin and moves upwards to the right, indicating a linear relationship. There are two points labeled as (i) and (ii) on the line, with point (i) at a higher temperature and pressure, and point (ii) at a lower temperature and pressure.
