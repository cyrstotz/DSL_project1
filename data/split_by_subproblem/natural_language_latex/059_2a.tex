The graph is a Temperature (T) versus Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as S and the y-axis is labeled as T. The graph contains several curves and points:

- There are three isobaric lines labeled as "isobaric 0.5 bar", "isobaric 1 bar", and "isobaric 0.1 bar".
- There is an isotherm line labeled as "isotherm".
- There is an isentropic line labeled as "isentropic".
- Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The temperature at point 0 is approximately negative 30 degrees Celsius.
- The process from point 0 to 1 is labeled as "adiabatic".
- The process from point 1 to 2 is labeled as "isotherm".
- The process from point 2 to 3 is labeled as "isobaric".
- The process from point 3 to 4 is labeled as "isobaric".
- The process from point 4 to 5 is labeled as "isotherm".
- The process from point 5 to 6 is labeled as "adiabatic".
