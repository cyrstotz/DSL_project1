The average temperature \( T_{KF} \) is equal to the integral of temperature \( T \) with respect to entropy \( S \) from \( S_a \) to \( S_e \), divided by the difference \( S_a - S_e \).

For an adiabatic and isobaric process, the integral from \( S_a \) to \( S_e \) of \( T \) with respect to \( S \) is considered.

The reversible heat \( q_{rev} \) is equal to the change in entropy \( \Delta S \) multiplied by the temperature \( T \).

The change in entropy \( \Delta S \) is equal to the infinitesimal heat added \( \delta Q \) divided by the temperature \( T \), evaluated under reversible conditions.

The reversible heat \( q_{rev} \) is also equal to the change in entropy \( \Delta S \) multiplied by the temperature \( T \), which is equal to the enthalpy at \( S_a \) minus the enthalpy at \( S_e \).

The average temperature \( T_{KF} \) is then given by the enthalpy difference \( h_a - h_e \) divided by the entropy difference \( S_a - S_e \).

The average temperature \( \bar{T} \) is calculated as the specific heat at constant pressure \( C_p \) times the difference \( T_2 - T_1 \) divided by the natural logarithm of \( T_2 \) over \( T_1 \). This is equal to the integral from \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \) of \( C_p \) with respect to \( T \) plus the volume \( v \) times the temperature difference \( T_2 - T_1 \), divided by the integral from \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \) of \( \frac{C_p}{T} \) with respect to \( T \). Simplifying further, it becomes \( \frac{C_p (T_2 - T_1) + 0}{C_p \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)} \).

This results in \( \frac{298.15 \text{K} - 288.15 \text{K}}{\ln \left( \frac{298.15}{288.15} \right)} = 283.127 \text{K} \).
