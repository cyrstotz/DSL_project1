u_2 equals u_1, since the temperature is constant.

x_{Eis,1} equals the fraction of the mass of ice, m_{Eis}, over the mass of the entire mixture, m_{EW}, which equals 0.6.

u_2 equals u_f plus x times the difference between u_g and u_f.

The mass of ice in the second state, m_{Eis,2}, equals 0.6 times 0.1 kilograms, which equals 0.06 kilograms.
