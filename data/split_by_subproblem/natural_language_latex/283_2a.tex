Graph 1: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled T in Kelvin and the horizontal axis labeled S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. There are two curves on the graph. The first curve starts at a point labeled 0 at the bottom left, moves upwards in a zigzag pattern, and ends at a point labeled 1 at the top right. The second curve starts at a point labeled 1 near the top left, moves downwards in a zigzag pattern, and ends at a point labeled 2 at the bottom right.

Graph 2: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled T in Kelvin and the horizontal axis labeled S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The curve starts at point 0 at the bottom left, moves upwards to point 1, then continues upwards to point 2 labeled "isobare", then reaches a peak at point 3. From point 3, the curve moves downwards to point 4, then slightly upwards to point 5 with a horizontal dashed line labeled T5 equals 431.0 Kelvin, and finally moves downwards to point 6.
