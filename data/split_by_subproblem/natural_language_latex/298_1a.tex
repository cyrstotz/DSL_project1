1. Energy balance for water:
The rate of change of energy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the specific enthalpy at the inlet and the specific enthalpy at the outlet, plus the rate of heat added and the rate of heat output.

This implies that the rate of heat output is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference between the specific enthalpy at the outlet and the specific enthalpy at the inlet, minus the rate of heat added.

Substituting the values, the rate of heat output is equal to 0.2 kilograms per second times (4.43 kilojoules per kilogram minus 2.92 kilojoules per kilogram) minus 100 kilowatts.

This results in a rate of heat output of negative 62.18 kilowatts, where the negative sign indicates that the heat is being transferred outward.
