Since there is still ice present, the temperature \( T_{w,2} \) is 0 degrees Celsius.

The system is isobaric since the piston is movable.

This implies that \( p_{B2} \) equals \( p_{B1} \), which is 1.3837 bar, which means \( V_{g1} \) is not equal to \( V_{g2} \).

The final state is in thermodynamic equilibrium, implying that there is still ice present, so everything is at 0 degrees Celsius, hence \( T_{g2} \) is 0 degrees Celsius.
