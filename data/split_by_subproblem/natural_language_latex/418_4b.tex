From 3 to 4:
From 2 to 3:

The equation is zero equals negative W dot subscript k plus m dot times the difference of h subscript 2 minus h subscript 3.

h subscript 2 equals

h subscript 3 equals 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram

T subscript 2 equals T subscript 1 minus 6 Kelvin

This implies that m dot equals W dot subscript k divided by the difference of h subscript 2 minus h subscript 3.
