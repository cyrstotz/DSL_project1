In state 2:
The product of mass flow rate of mixture (m_mis) and the difference between internal energy at state 2 (U_2) and internal energy at state A (U_A) equals zero.
This implies U_2 equals U_A.

U_A is calculated as the internal energy at the fluid state (U_Fl) plus 0.6 times the difference between the internal energy of the mixture (U_mis) and the internal energy at the fluid state (U_Fl).
Substituting the values, U_A equals negative 0.045 kilojoules per kilogram plus 0.6 times (negative 333.45 kilojoules per kilogram plus 0.045 kilojoules per kilogram), which results in U_A being negative 9.002 kilojoules per kilogram.

The mass of mixture at state A (U_A, mis) is calculated as the mass of fluid (m_Fl) times 0.6, which is 0.1 kilograms times 0.6, resulting in 0.06 kilograms.
The mass at state A2 for the mixture (m_A2, mis) is 0.04 kilograms.

X is defined as the ratio of the mass of fluid (m_Fl) to the sum of the mass of fluid (m_Fl) and the mass of refrigerant (m_Fr).
