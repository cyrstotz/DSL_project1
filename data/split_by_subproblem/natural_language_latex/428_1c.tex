The mass flow rate through the turbine from state 1 to 2 is given by:
The entropy at 700 degrees Celsius in the liquid state is 0.85 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The entropy at 700 degrees Celsius in the liquid state is 1.306 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The rate of change of entropy with respect to time is equal to the mass flow rate times the difference in entropy between the outlet and inlet temperatures in the liquid state, which equals the heat input rate divided by the temperature plus the generated entropy rate.

This implies that 0.1 kilograms per second times the difference between 0.85 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and 1.306 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin plus 162.182 kilowatts divided by 253.15 Kelvin equals the generated entropy rate.

Therefore, the generated entropy rate is 0.1605 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
