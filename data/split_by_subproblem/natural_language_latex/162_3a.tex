Section 3a) Perfect Gas:

1. If MRT equals rho times V, then M equals rho times V subscript kl divided by RT, which equals 3.42 kilograms.

2. R equals R divided by M, which equals 0.1662.

3. F subscript g plus p subscript 0 times A over A equals p subscript g times A over A.

4. p subscript g equals F subscript g divided by A plus p subscript 0, which equals 1.46 bar.

5. F subscript g equals 9.81 times (m subscript k plus m subscript EW), which equals 314.901 Newtons.

6. A equals 0.00785 square meters.
