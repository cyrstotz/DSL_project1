R equals the ratio of R bar over T sub G, approximately equal to 0.166 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

A equals the square of the ratio of D over 2, multiplied by pi, approximately equal to 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.

m dot 1 equals m dot AMB plus the ratio of m dot EVW times g over A, approximately equal to 1.401 BAR.

m dot g equals the ratio of m dot 1 times V sub G1 over the product of T sub G1 and R, approximately equal to 3.428 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms.
