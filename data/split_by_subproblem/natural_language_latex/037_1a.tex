Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet, plus the rate of heat added, minus the rate of heat output.

The rate of heat output equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet, plus the rate of heat added.

The enthalpy at the inlet, denoted as \( h_{in} \), for the process from 70 degrees Celsius to A-2, is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy at the outlet, denoted as \( h_{out} \), for the process from 100 degrees Celsius to A-2, is 479.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, the rate of heat output, which is scratched out, is 62.182 kilowatts.
