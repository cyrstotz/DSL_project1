The rate of change of exergy per unit volume, denoted as dot E subscript x, vol, equals the product of T subscript 0 and dot S subscript ir, z.

For stationary flow processes:

Zero equals the product of dot m and the difference (s subscript 0 minus s subscript 6) plus the quotient of dot Q over T subscript 0 plus dot S subscript ir, z.

Dot S subscript ir, z equals s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0 minus the quotient of q over T subscript 0, which equals 0.927905 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus the quotient of 1795 kilojoules per kilogram over 728.8, resulting in 0.505 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The exergy per unit volume, denoted as e subscript x, vol, equals the product of T subscript 0 and dot S subscript ir, z, which equals 243.15 times 0.505, resulting in 122.832 kilowatts per kilogram.
