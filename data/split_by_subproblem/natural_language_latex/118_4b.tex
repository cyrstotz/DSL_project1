b)

Zero equals the mass flow rate of R134a times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry, plus the heat transfer rate minus the work rate.

The mass flow rate of R134a equals negative work rate divided by the difference between enthalpy at state 2 and enthalpy at state 3.

Enthalpy at state 2 is found using the table A-10 and linear interpolation with the formula (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) times (x - x1) plus y1, using the points (-8, 242.54) and (-1, 249.50).

Enthalpy at state 2 equals 243.72 kilojoules per kilogram.

To find temperature at state 3, use the formula (hg - hf) / (hg - hf) from table A-10, then apply linear interpolation where hf equals 12.445 and hg.

Linear interpolation from table A-10, S1,3 equals 0.5226 omega squared over gK, leading to the values 0.2066 corresponding to 264.75 and 0.3374 corresponding to 273.66, resulting in enthalpy at state 3 equals 269.09 omega over g.

The heat transfer rate Q34 equals negative 28 watts.

The ratio of the heat transfer rate Q34 to the difference between 243.72 and 269.09 omega over g equals 1.10 omega over g times four-fifths.
