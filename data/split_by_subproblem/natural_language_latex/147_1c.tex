Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at exit and the entropy at entry, minus the heat transfer rate divided by the condenser temperature, plus the generated entropy.

The generated entropy equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the entropy at entry and the entropy at exit, plus the heat transfer rate divided by the condenser temperature.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entry, plus the heat transfer rate.

The mass flow rate equals the heat transfer rate divided by the difference between the enthalpy at entry and the enthalpy at exit, which is also equal to 62,182 kilojoules divided by the difference between the enthalpy at entry and the enthalpy at exit.
