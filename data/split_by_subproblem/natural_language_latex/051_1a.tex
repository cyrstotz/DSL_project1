Statistical steady flow process with one mass flow:

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the entrance and the enthalpy at the exit, plus the heat input rate minus the heat output rate.

Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the entrance and the enthalpy at the exit, plus the heat input rate minus the heat output rate.

The heat output rate equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at the entrance and the enthalpy at the exit, plus the heat input rate.

The heat output rate equals 0.3 times the difference between the enthalpy at the entrance and the enthalpy at the exit, plus 100 kilojoules per second, which equals 67.182 kilowatts.

For the entrance conditions:

The temperature is 70 degrees Celsius.

The quality (x) is 0.

The pressure is 0.3119 bar from A-2.

The enthalpy at the entrance is equal to the fluid enthalpy, 252.98 kilojoules per kilogram, from A-2.

For the exit conditions:

The temperature at the exit is 100 degrees Celsius.

The quality (x) is 0.

The pressure is 1.013 bar from A-2.

The enthalpy at the exit is equal to the fluid enthalpy, 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram, from A-2.
