The mass flow rate of R134a is denoted as \(\dot{m}_{R134a} = ?\)

State (2-3) is isentropic because it is reversible and adiabatic.

The equation for the process, which is stationary, is given by:
\[
\dot{m}_{R134a} (h_e - h_a) + \sum_i \dot{Q}_i - \sum_n \dot{W}_n = 0
\]

Energy balance at the throttle (isentropic):
\[
\dot{m}(0-) = 0 \quad \text{(Energy balance at the compressor)}
\]

The equation:
\[
\dot{m}(h_2 - h_3) = 28W
\]

is simplified to:
\[
\dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) = 28 \, \text{W} \Rightarrow \dot{m} = \frac{28 \, \text{W}}{h_2 - h_3}
\]

The quality at state 2 is:
\[
x_2 = 1 \Rightarrow \text{completely vapor (saturated)}
\]

Question about \( T_i \):
\[
\text{5 mbar below triple point and 10 K above sublimation point.}
\]

This implies:
\[
p = 1 \, \text{mbar} \quad \text{and} \quad T_i = -10^\circ \text{C} = 263 \, \text{K}
\]

Thus, the temperature of the evaporator is:
\[
T_{\text{Verdampfer}} = 257 \, \text{K}
\]

The enthalpies at states 2 and 3 are:
\[
h_2 = h_{2g} \quad h_3 = h_{3,f} \, (\text{completely compressed})
\]

At a pressure of 8 bar:
\[
h_{3,f} = h_3 = 93.42 \, \text{(A.11)}
\]

The entropy from state 2 to 3 remains constant:
\[
s_3 = s_{3,f} = 0.3459
\]

At \( x_2 = 1 \), this implies:
\[
s_{3,f} = s_{2,g} = s_2 = 0.3459 \Rightarrow p_2 = ?
\]
