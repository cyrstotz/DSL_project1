The subsection labeled "c)" contains the following equations and text:

1. \( Q_2 \) equals "Energy balanced." followed by the word "closed" and the word "container:".
2. \( h_2 - h_1 \) equals \( Q_2 - W_v \).
3. \( W_v \) equals \( \frac{R}{n-1} (T_2 - T_1) \) plus \( W_v \) equals \( Q_1 \).
4. The expression continues with \( 0.003429 \times (500) \times 0.633 \) plus \( \frac{R \times (500)}{\) (the equation is incomplete and cuts off here).
