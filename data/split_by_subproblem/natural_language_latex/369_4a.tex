Verbal Description of the Graph:

The graph is a phase diagram with pressure \( P \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. The y-axis is labeled with \( P \) in bar and pascals. The x-axis is labeled with \( T \) in kelvin.

The graph shows three regions labeled "solid", "liquid", and "gas". The boundary between the solid and liquid regions is a curve starting from the y-axis and moving upwards to the right. The boundary between the liquid and gas regions is another curve starting from the x-axis and moving upwards to the right, ending at a point labeled "critical point".

There is a point labeled "triple point" where the three regions meet.

Two processes are shown on the graph:
1. A horizontal line labeled "isothermal" from point I to point II.
2. A vertical line labeled "isothermal pressure decrease" from point III to point II.
