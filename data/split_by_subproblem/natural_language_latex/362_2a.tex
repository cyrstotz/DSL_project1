A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as S in units of kilograms per Kelvin and the y-axis labeled as T in degrees Celsius. The graph contains two isobars labeled as "isobar" and "isobar with p_s equals 0.5 bar". There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Point 0 is at the origin. Point 1 is slightly above and to the right of point 0. Point 2 is further above and to the right of point 1. Point 3 is above and to the right of point 2, on the upper isobar. Point 4 is below and to the right of point 3, on the lower isobar. Point 5 is below and to the left of point 4. Point 6 is above and to the left of point 5. Arrows indicate the direction of the process from point 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6.
