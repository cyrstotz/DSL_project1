The section labeled "e)" contains the following mathematical expressions and text:

- The change in entropy, denoted as Delta s_12, is equal to m_2 times s_2 minus m_1 times s_1.
- The term "Austauschfaktor" translates to "exchange factor".
- m_2 is defined as m_1 plus Delta m, which equals 5755 kilograms.
- s_2 at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius and x equals 1 is 0.854 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
- s_1 is evaluated at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius and x equals 0.005.
