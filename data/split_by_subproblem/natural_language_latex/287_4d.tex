Epsilon k equals the fraction of Q k over W k, which is equal to the fraction of Q k over W v.

Q k equals E.1.H.S. Evaporator.

Q equals m dot times the difference of h one minus h two plus Q dot.

Q dot equals m dot times the difference of h two minus h one, which equals m dot times the difference of h g at negative six degrees Celsius minus 93.12.

This equals 0.00667 kilojoules per second times the difference of 213.72 minus 93.12, which equals 1800.0168 kilojoules per hour, and simplifies further to 166.8 kilojoules per hour.

Epsilon k equals the fraction of 166.8 over 25, which underlines the result as 5.57.
