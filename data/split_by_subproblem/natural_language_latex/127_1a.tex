Zero equals the mass flow rate out times the difference between the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet plus the heat flow rate out.

The heat flow rate Q dot equals the mass flow rate out times the sum of the enthalpy at the outlet and the enthalpy at the inlet.

The heat flow rate Q equals Q1 times the sum of 449.04 and 292.88, which equals 371.87 Joules.

On the right side of the page, there are two notes:
- The enthalpy at the inlet, h_em, is 292.88 kilojoules per kilogram.
- The enthalpy at the outlet, h_aus, is 449.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

Zero energy equals m2 times u2 minus m1 times u1 equals zero times m2 times h1 plus Q_aus.

The change in m2 equals m2 times u2 minus m1 times u1 minus Q_aus.
