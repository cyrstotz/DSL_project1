The specific heat capacity at constant pressure, c_p, is equal to the gas constant R plus the specific heat capacity at constant volume c_v, which equals 799.28 Joules per Kelvin per kilogram.

The expression c_p times the mass of the gas m_g times the initial temperature of the gas T_{g1} plus 0.6 times the mass of the evaporator m_{EW}.

The ratio of the specific heat capacities c_p to c_v equals n, which is 1.26.

The ratio of the final temperature of the gas T_{g2} to the initial temperature T_{g1} equals the ratio of the final pressure p_2 to the initial pressure p_1.

The pressure remains constant from state 1 to state 2.

The final pressure of the gas p_{g2} is 1.4 bar.

The temperature T_{g2} of the gas will be just above 0 degrees Celsius, as ice is still present, and the ice mixture has a temperature of approximately 0 degrees Celsius.
