The graph described is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with Entropy in kilojoules per Kelvin, and the y-axis is labeled with Temperature in Kelvin. There are six points labeled from 0 to 6, connected by lines to form a cycle. Specifically, points 0 and 1 are connected by a horizontal line, points 1 and 2 by a vertical line, points 2 and 3 by a line with a positive slope, points 3 and 4 by a horizontal line, points 4 and 5 by a line with a negative slope, points 5 and 6 by a vertical line, and points 6 and 0 by a horizontal line. Additionally, there are two isobars labeled 0.5 BAR and 0.491 BAR. The temperatures 431.8 Kelvin and 243.15 Kelvin are indicated with horizontal dashed lines.

The equations provided are:
- The entropy at point 1 equals the entropy at point 2.
- The pressure at point 2 equals the pressure at point 3.
- The entropy at point 3 equals the entropy at point 4.
- The pressure at point 1 equals the pressure at points 4 and 5.
- The pressure at point 6 equals the pressure at point 0.
- The entropy at point 5 equals the entropy at point 6.
