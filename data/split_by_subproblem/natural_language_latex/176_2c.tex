The product of m_gz and Delta ex_tot equals m_gz times the expression in parentheses: h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus the difference of w_6 squared and w_0 squared all divided by 2.

This equals m_gz times the expression in parentheses: c_p^0 times (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 times the sum of c_p^0 times the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0) plus the difference of w_6 squared and w_0 squared all divided by 2.

This equals m_gz times the expression in parentheses: 1006 Joules per kilogram Kelvin times (320.87 minus 243.15) minus 243.15 Kelvin times the sum of 1006 Joules per kilogram Kelvin times the natural logarithm of (320.87 divided by 243.15) plus the difference of 50.7 meters squared per second squared and 200 meters squared per second squared all divided by 2.

This equals m_gz times 120.73 w_0 squared per kilogram.

Therefore, Delta ex_tot equals 120.73 w_0 squared per kilogram.
