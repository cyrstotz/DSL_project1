Energy balance:
The derivative of energy E with respect to time t equals the mass flow rate m dot times the sum of the enthalpy at the inlet h_i, half the square of the velocity at the inlet v_i squared, plus the product of gravitational acceleration g and the height at the inlet z_i, plus the sum of heat flow rates Q dot, minus the sum of work rates W dot.

Zero equals the mass flow rate m dot times the difference between the enthalpy h and the reference enthalpy h_0, plus the heat flow rate out Q dot aus, plus another heat flow rate Q dot x.

This equals the mass flow rate m dot times the difference between the core enthalpy h_kern and the outlet enthalpy h_aus, plus the heat flow rate out Q dot aus, plus another heat flow rate Q dot x.

The heat flow rate out Q dot aus equals the mass flow rate m dot times the specific heat capacity C_p times the difference in temperature between the inlet T_ein and the outlet T_aus, plus the heat flow rate in Q dot ein, plus 100 kilowatts.

The heat flow rate out Q dot aus equals the mass flow rate m dot times the specific heat capacity C_p times the difference in temperature between the outlet T_aus and the inlet T_ein, which calculates to 0.3 times the difference between 298.15 and 288.15, resulting in minus 70 kilowatts.
