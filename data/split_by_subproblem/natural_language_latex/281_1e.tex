The entropy at 400 degrees Celsius is 1.3069 kilojoules per kilogram.

The total entropy, denoted as S_u, is calculated by multiplying 1.3069 by 5775, resulting in 7547.3 kilojoules per kilogram.

The entropy at 40 degrees Celsius is 0.9549.

The entropy, denoted as S_x, is calculated by multiplying 0.9549 by the sum of 5775 and 3600, resulting in 8952.2 kilojoules per kilogram.

The entropy, denoted as S_erz, is calculated by dividing 35,000 by the difference of 40 and 20, resulting in 1400 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals the quotient of Q_B,itz by T.

The change in entropy, denoted as Delta S, is calculated by subtracting S_1 from the sum of S_x and S_erz.

This results in -7547.3 plus the sum of 8952.2 and 1400.

The final result is 2804.9 kilojoules per kilogram.
