e) The temperature T inside will become deeper but increasingly less so; it cannot go infinitely deep.

Graph Description: The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as t and the y-axis labeled as T. The curve starts at a high value on the y-axis and decreases steeply at first, then gradually levels off as it moves to the right along the x-axis, indicating that the temperature T decreases over time t but at a decreasing rate.
