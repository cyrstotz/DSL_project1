The list includes the following equations:

1. The change in exergy due to the stream, denoted as Delta e_ex, str, is equal to e_ex, str minus e_ex, 1.

2. The exergy at state 6, denoted as e_ex, 6, is equal to h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times the difference between s_6 and s_0, plus ke_6.

3. The exergy of the stream, denoted as e_ex, str, is equal to h_1 minus h_0 minus T_0 times the left parenthesis. (Note: The equation seems incomplete as it ends abruptly after "T_0 times the left parenthesis.")
