The mass of gas times the specific heat capacity at condition 2 times the outlet temperature 2 equals the mass of gas times the specific heat capacity at condition 2 times the outlet temperature plus the mass flow rate of gas times the inlet temperature.

Zero equals the mass of gas times the specific heat capacity at condition 2 times the difference between outlet temperature 2 and inlet temperature equals the mass of gas times the specific heat capacity at condition 2 times the outlet temperature minus the mass of gas times the specific heat capacity at condition 2 times outlet temperature 2.

The mass of gas equals the mass flow rate of gas times the difference between outlet temperature 2 and outlet temperature divided by the difference between outlet temperature and inlet temperature.

This equals 57.55 kilograms times the fraction of 400 degrees Celsius minus 70 degrees Celsius over 80 degrees Celsius minus 20 degrees Celsius.

The mass of gas equals 3453 kilograms.
