Energy balance:

The equation is zero equals the total mass flow rate times negative change in specific exergy plus the sum over j of one minus the ratio of the reference temperature to the temperature at j times the heat flow rate at j minus the sum over k of the work rate at k minus the exergy rate due to irreversibilities.

The exergy rate due to irreversibilities is equal to negative total mass flow rate times the change in specific exergy.

The specific exergy rate due to irreversibilities is equal to negative change in specific exergy, which is negative 100 kilojoules per kilogram.
