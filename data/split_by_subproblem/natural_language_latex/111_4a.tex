The graph is described as a phase diagram with the y-axis labeled as 'p' and the x-axis labeled as 'T'. The graph displays three phases: solid, liquid, and gas. The boundaries between these phases are represented by curves that separate these regions. There are three points labeled as 1, 2, and 3, with arrows indicating transitions between these points. The transition from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "i)" and the transition from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "ii)".
