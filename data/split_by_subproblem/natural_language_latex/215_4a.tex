The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled P and the horizontal axis is labeled T. There are three distinct regions labeled "liquid", "gaseous", and a line separating these regions. The line starts from the origin and curves upwards to the right. There is a horizontal line at 5 millibar intersecting the curve. Two points are marked on the graph: point (i) is on the curve, and point (ii) is below the curve in the gaseous region. The temperature at point (ii) is labeled T1 and the pressure at point (ii) is labeled 10 Kelvin. The region below the curve and above the horizontal line is labeled "test".
