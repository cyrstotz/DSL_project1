From the table A-15 interpolated,

The mass flow rate of R134a times the difference in enthalpy between h2 and h1 is not equal to the power output, which implies that the power output is zero.

The mass flow rate of R134a equals 28 Watts divided by the difference in enthalpy between h3 and h2, which equals 28 Watts divided by 7 Watts, resulting in 4 kilograms per hour.
