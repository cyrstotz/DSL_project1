d) Energy balance - Open system

The change in energy, Delta E, equals m2 times u2 minus m1 times u1, which equals Delta m12 times hf12 plus QR,12 minus Qaus,12.

Here are some given values and equations:
- m1 equals mges,1 which is 5755 kilograms.
- m2 equals m1 plus Delta m12.
- T1 equals 100 degrees Celsius.
- T2 equals 70 degrees Celsius.

The internal energy u1 at 100 degrees Celsius is given by uf at 100 degrees Celsius from table TAB-A2, which is -418.44 kilojoules per kilogram.

The internal energy u2 at 70 degrees Celsius is given by uf at 70 degrees Celsius from table TAB-A2, which is -232.95 kilojoules per kilogram.

The enthalpy hf12 at 20 degrees Celsius is given by hf at 20 degrees Celsius from table TAB-A2, which is 83.96 kilojoules per kilogram.

The equation (m1 plus Delta m12) times u2 minus m1 times u1 equals Delta m12 times h12.

The equation m1 times u2 minus m1 times u1 equals Delta m12 times (h12 minus u2).

Delta m12 is calculated as m1 times (u2 minus u1) divided by (h12 minus u2), which equals 3459.48 kilograms, underlined value 3761.52 kilograms.

u1 is calculated as uf at 100 degrees Celsius plus x0 times (ug at 100 degrees Celsius minus uf at 100 degrees Celsius), which equals 429.58 kilojoules per kilogram.
