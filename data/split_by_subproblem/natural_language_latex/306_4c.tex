The pressures \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are both equal to 1.0199 bar, as taken from A-10.

The enthalpy \( h_i \) is equal to \( h_1 \) because it is a throttling process.

The enthalpy \( h_a \) at 8 bar and \( x = 0 \) is 93.92 kilojoules per kilogram, as taken from A-11.

In the solution section:

The value of \( x \) is calculated using the formula \( x = \frac{h_a - h_f}{h_g - h_f} \). Substituting the values, \( x = \frac{93.92 - 16.82}{239.62 - 16.82} = 0.356 \).
