Diagram:
A horizontal pipe with an arrow pointing to the right labeled Q dot and labeled as Gas.

The equation dE/dt equals Q dot minus W dot.

T subscript 26 is less than T subscript 46 because heat is lost/transferred upwards.

The pressure p subscript 26 equals p subscript 46 since the volume regulates the balance.
