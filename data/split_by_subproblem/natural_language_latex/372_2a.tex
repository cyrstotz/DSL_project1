The graph description is as follows:

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled 'T' in units of C/J (Celsius per Joule) and the horizontal axis labeled 's' in units of kJ/kg (kiloJoules per kilogram). The graph features a closed loop with six points labeled from 1 to 6. These points are connected in the following manner:

- Point 1 is connected to Point 2 with a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 2 is connected to Point 3 with a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 3 is connected to Point 4 with a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 4 is connected to Point 5 with a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 5 is connected to Point 6 with a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 6 is connected back to Point 1 with a line labeled "isobar".

Additionally, the points are labeled with pressures:
- The pressure at Point 3 is equal to the pressure at Point 2.
- The pressure at Point 4 is equal to the pressure at Point 5.
- The pressure at Point 6 is equal to itself.
