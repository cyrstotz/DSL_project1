The graph description is as follows: The graph is a phase diagram with the y-axis labeled as "p" and the x-axis labeled as "T [Â°C]". The y-axis represents pressure and the x-axis represents temperature. The graph shows three regions labeled "solid", "liquid", and "gas". There are three points labeled "1", "2", and "3". Point "1" is in the liquid region, point "2" is in the solid region, and point "3" is in the gas region. There is a line connecting points "1" and "2" labeled "isobar", and a line connecting points "2" and "3" labeled "isotherm". The line separating the solid and liquid regions is labeled "melting line", and the line separating the liquid and gas regions is labeled "boiling line".

The state at point 2 is described as saturated vapor. The equation is T4 equals T1 equals 31.33 degrees Celsius equals T3.
