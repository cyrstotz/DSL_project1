d) The rate of exergy change, related to the iron process,

The rate of exergy change is equal to the product of the reference temperature and the rate of entropy production, and the specific exergy change is equal to the product of the reference temperature and the specific entropy production.

The reference temperature, T_0, is 243.15 Kelvin.

The specific entropy production, denoted as s_c,er, is calculated as the difference between s_a and s_c plus the ratio of heat transfer q_i over temperature T_j, which equals the difference between s_c and s_0 plus the ratio of heat transfer q_3 over the reference temperature T_0, resulting in 1.2284.

The difference between s_c and s_0 is equal to the specific heat capacity at constant pressure times the natural logarithm of the ratio of the temperature T_c to the reference temperature T_0, which equals 0.30136 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

The ratio of the heat transfer q_3 over the reference temperature T_0 is 0.922 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Thus, the specific exergy change, dot e_x,verl, is the product of the reference temperature T_0 and the specific entropy production s_c,er, resulting in 298.694 kilojoules per kilogram.
