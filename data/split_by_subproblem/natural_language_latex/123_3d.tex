The mass of the first ice, \( m_{Eis1} \), is 0.6 times the mass of \( m_e \), which equals 0.06 kg.

The mass of the water, \( m_{Wasser} \), is 0.04 kg.

The volumes \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \) are equal.

The pressures \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are equal.

The initial temperature \( T_1 \) is 273.15 K, which is 0 degrees Celsius.

The change in internal energy \( \Delta U_1 \) equals the heat \( Q \), which is the internal energy at \( T_{g2} \) minus the internal energy at \( T_1 \), equals the mass of the water times the temperature difference \( T_2 - T_1 \), which equals 11500 Joules.

The potential energy \( PE \) equals the atmospheric pressure \( p_0 \) plus the product of mass \( m \), gravitational acceleration \( g \), and height \( z \), which results in 1.0 plus 1.1 bar.

The temperature difference \( T_2 - T_1 \) equals the heat \( Q \) divided by the product of mass \( m \) and specific heat at constant volume \( c_V \). Therefore, \( T_2 \) equals \( Q \) divided by the product of \( m \) and \( c_V \) plus \( T_1 \), which calculates to \( \frac{11500 \, \text{J}}{0.1 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.653 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}}} + 273.15 \, \text{K} = 286.846 \, \text{K} \).

The internal energy \( U \) equals the product of mass \( m \) and... (the equation is incomplete).
