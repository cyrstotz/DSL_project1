Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and the enthalpy at entrance plus the heat transfer rate, and the work done equals zero.

The mass flow rate equals the heat transfer rate divided by the difference between the enthalpy at entrance and the enthalpy at exit, which equals 0.5 kilowatts.

Regarding an exothermic system:

The sum of heat equals the change in energy, which is equal to internal energy plus half the velocity squared plus half the pressure squared.

The heat at condition x40 equals the energy at state 2 minus the energy at state 1, which equals the heat at condition x12.

The change in energy equals the mass times the specific heat at constant pressure times the change in temperature.

From 20 degrees Celsius corresponds to the change in mass from state 1 to state 2.

At 70 degrees Celsius corresponds to 5.75 kilograms.
