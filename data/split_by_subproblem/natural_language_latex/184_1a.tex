Zero equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and at entrance, plus the sum of heat inputs minus the sum of heat outputs. This can be rewritten as the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and at entrance, plus the heat input from the source minus the heat output. Therefore, the heat output equals the mass flow rate times the difference between the enthalpy at exit and at entrance, plus the heat input from the source.

The term 'h_e - h_a' represents the difference in specific enthalpy of a boiling liquid at 70 degrees Celsius and 100 degrees Celsius.

For enthalpy at exit, denoted as h_e, at 70 degrees Celsius, the value is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram. For enthalpy at entrance, denoted as h_a, at 100 degrees Celsius, the value is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

Calculating 'h_e - h_a' leads to the heat output being 0.3 times the difference between 292.98 times 10^3 and 419.04 times 10^3, plus 100 times 10^3, which results in -62.182 kilowatts.

This value must be negative from the perspective without a jacket, hence the heat output is -62.182 kilowatts.
