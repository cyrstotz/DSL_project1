Zero equals the mass flow rate in (specific enthalpy in minus specific enthalpy out) plus the heat transfer rate R minus the work rate R zero plus the heat transfer rate out.

The specific enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius equals the specific enthalpy in, which is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced in Table A-2.

The specific enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius equals the specific enthalpy out, which is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram, as referenced in Table A-2.

The heat transfer rate out equals the mass flow rate in times (specific enthalpy out minus specific enthalpy in) minus the heat transfer rate R, which calculates to 0.3 times (419.04 minus 292.98) minus 400, resulting in negative 62.18 kilowatts.
