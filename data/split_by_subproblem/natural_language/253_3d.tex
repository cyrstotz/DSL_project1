First law of thermodynamics for a steady-state process  
Delta U one two equals Q one two minus W one two  

(U two minus U one) at steady-state equals Q one two equals 1.5 kJ  
Therefore, U two equals 1.5 kJ at steady-state plus U one  

U one equals U f (p equals 1.6 bar plus m k g over A)  
plus X eis one (U f equals U f two)  
approximately equals negative 133.45 kJ per kg
