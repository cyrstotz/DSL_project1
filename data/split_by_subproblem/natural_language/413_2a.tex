A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the vertical axis and entropy (S) on the horizontal axis, labeled as "idealen Fluid" on the x-axis and "S [kJ/kgK]". The graph shows a cycle with six points labeled 1 to 6. The curve between points 1 and 2 is marked as "irreversibel", between 2 and 3 as "isobar", between 3 and 4 as "irreversibel", and between 5 and 6 as "reversibel". The line between points 4 and 5 is labeled "isobar", and point 4 is marked as "P4 = P5" and point 6 as "P0 = P6".
