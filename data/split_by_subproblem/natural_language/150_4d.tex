U sub 2, FW minus U sub 1, FW equals Q sub 12 equals m rew (x sub a u sub a plus x sub f (1 minus x) u sub f rel)

minus (x sub a u sub a rel plus (y minus x sub a) u sub f rel)

Q sub 12 equals m rew equals x sub a (u sub f rel 3 minus u sub f rel) plus u sub f rel

equals x sub a (u sub f rel 3 minus u sub f rel) plus u sub f rel

equals (x sub a minus x sub f) (u sub f rel 3 minus u sub f rel)

equals Q sub 12 minus x sub 2

equals m rew (u sub f rel minus u sub (f rel) 1)

plus x sub a u sub f rel u sub f rel equals 21 degrees Celsius

Zero equals m with a dot subtracted from A times h subtracted from 1 minus h subtracted from 2 plus Q subtracted from k.

Q subtracted from k equals negative m with a dot subtracted from A times h subtracted from 1 minus h subtracted from 2 equals crossed out 744.3 kilojoules per hour equals crossed out equals 120.3 watts.

E subtracted from k equals absolute value of Q subtracted from k divided by absolute value of W subtracted from A equals 4.3.
