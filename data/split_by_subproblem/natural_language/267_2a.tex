A graph is shown with temperature T in Kelvin on the vertical axis and entropy s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the horizontal axis. There are six points labeled 1 to 6 connected by lines, forming a closed loop. The lines are labeled with different pressures: P equals P2, P equals P3, and P equals P0. A bypass is indicated between points 4 and 5.
