A graph is drawn with three curves labeled 1, 2, and 3. There are points marked on the curves: point q on curve 1, point b on curve 2, and point o on curve 3. Vertical lines are drawn connecting these points to the x-axis. The x-axis has labels: 0.9970, 1.0450, and 1.0970. The y-axis has labels: 0, 1, 2, and 3. There is a horizontal line at the bottom of the graph, labeled "doppelt" with an arrow pointing to the left.

Below the graph, there is a table with two columns and several rows. The first column is labeled with numbers from 0 to 4. The second column contains numbers: 1.0970, 1.0450, 1.0450, 0.9970, and 0.9970.
