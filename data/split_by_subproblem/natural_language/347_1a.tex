A graph is shown with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T) in degrees Celsius on the x-axis. The graph features a curve labeled "mass" on the left side, "Dampf" (steam) on the right side, and "Kasselampf" (liquid) in the middle. Points are marked as 1, 2, and 3 on the graph. The x-axis is labeled with Ti and T in degrees Celsius, and the curve ends at a point labeled ND.
