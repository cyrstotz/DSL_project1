Problem Gas

p M gas 1 equals p ambient plus F gas over A plus F 1 fluid over A

R equals R over M gas equals A 166 over 11 over gas k

A equals pi over 4 times D squared equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 meters squared

F gas over A equals 32 kilograms times 2.34 meters per second squared over 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 equals 93,569.49 pascals

F 1 fluid over A equals G fluid times 5.17 kilograms over A over 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 equals 12.4 times 50 pascals arrow p gas 1 equals 140069.38 pascals

m gas equals rho gas times V over R times T equals rho gas times V over R times T equals 3.48 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms equals 3.483 grams
