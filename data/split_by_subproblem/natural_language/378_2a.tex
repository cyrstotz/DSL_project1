A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph shows a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There are arrows indicating movement along the curve between these points. The curve starts at point 0 and moves through the labeled points. Various lines and arrows indicate different paths and directions. There are labels for rho equals rho zero, rho equals rho three, rho equals 0.75, and rho equals rho four.
