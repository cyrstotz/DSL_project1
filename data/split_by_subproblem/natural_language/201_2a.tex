T-s Diagram

A vertical axis labeled T in Kelvin and a horizontal axis labeled s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. 

A diagram with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 connected by lines. Point 0 is connected to point 1, point 1 to point 2, point 2 to point 3, point 3 to point 4, point 4 to point 5, and point 5 to point 6.

0 to 1: adiabatic to isentropic, compression, s one less than s zero, p one greater than p zero, T one greater than T zero

1 to 2: adiabatic, reversible to isentropic, s one equals s two

7 to 5: reversible to isentropic, p six to isobar

2 to 3: isobar

3 to 9: not reversible
