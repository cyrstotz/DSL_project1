A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled T in brackets K and the x-axis labeled S in brackets k divided by kg K. The graph consists of a curve with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The points are connected with lines and labeled as follows: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6. The graph is labeled with `p0 = p6`, `p2 = p3`, and `p4 = p5`. The word `isopaten` is written near the graph.
