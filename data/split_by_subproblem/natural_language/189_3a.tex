Part:

P ambient equals P normal equals one hundred thousand Pa

P kinetic equals F G divided by A equals m V squared divided by pi times D squared divided by four equals three nine nine six nine point five four Pa equals zero point three nine nine seven bar

P eis equals minus A equals F W divided by two times g divided by pi times D squared divided by four equals zero point zero zero zero seven eight Pa

P G one equals P ambient plus P kinetic plus P eis equals one three nine nine six nine point five four zero eight Pa equals one point three nine nine six nine five bar

mg equals R G divided by M S equals two zero six point six two eight J divided by kg

T G one equals seven hundred degrees Celsius equals seven seven three point one five six K

V G one equals three point seven four L equals zero point zero zero three seven four m cubed

Therefore mg equals P G one times V G one divided by R G times T G one equals zero point zero zero four one two kg equals three point four two g
