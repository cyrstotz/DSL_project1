In the first part, we have a pressure balance:

P total plus F S over A equals P i. This implies P total plus (m x plus m x plus w) g over (d over 2) squared pi equals 140089.4 Pascal.

With p V equals n R T

T equals 500 plus 273.15 equals 773.15 Kelvin

n equals p V over R T approximately equals 0.068

With M G equals 50 mg per mm, we obtain through m G over 1000 over 1000 approximately equals 3.42 g
