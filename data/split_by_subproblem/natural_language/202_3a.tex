P sub g1 equals E over A plus P sub amb. Three hundred fourteen point nine zero one plus fourteen point six five times ten to the power of five equals one four zero one four point eight watts per meter squared. A equals ... Pi times open parenthesis D over two close parenthesis squared equals zero point zero zero seven five meters squared. F equals F sub G, K plus F sub G, E, W equals open parenthesis m sub t plus m sub E, W close parenthesis times g equals open parenthesis thirty-two kilograms plus zero point seven kilograms close parenthesis times nine point eight one equals three hundred fourteen point nine zero one. P times V equals n times R times T implies n equals P times V over R times T equals three point four two grams. T equals five hundred degrees Celsius equals seven seven three point one seven three Kelvin. P equals one four six one four point nine Pascal. V equals zero point zero zero three one four meters cubed. n equals two over R equals two over M squared. R equals C three one four over fifty equals zero point one six six two eight joules per mole Kelvin equals D over g times Kelvin.
