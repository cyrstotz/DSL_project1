First main equation over total

A equals m times R two one times the quantity h two minus h one plus Q dot k

h two equals negative Q k divided by m times c plus h two

P one equals P two minus one equals three point three seven two five six bar

h two equals h one plus x two times the quantity h two minus h one

x two equals h two minus h f divided by h g minus h f

d) e k equals Q dot x one divided by the quantity one minus Q dot k divided by Q dot x one equals Q dot k divided by the quantity Q dot x b minus Q dot k

e)
