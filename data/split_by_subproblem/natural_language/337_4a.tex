A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as P [bar] and the x-axis labeled as T [K]. The graph shows a curve with a peak labeled '1500' and a point labeled '2'. Another similar graph is drawn next to it with the same axis labels, showing a curve and a point labeled '2'. 

A table is drawn with columns labeled P and T. The rows are numbered 1 to 4:
1. pu
2. 8 bar, -22Â°C
3. 8 bar
4. 8 bar

The table has notes:
- q41 = 0
- pu = smbor + pip
- Ti - 10 K = Tsublimationspunkt
- x2 = 1
- x3 = 1
- x4 = 0
- Ti - T3 = 6 K
- S3 = S2

Another graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled P [bar] and the x-axis labeled T [K]. The graph shows a curve with points labeled 'isotrop', 'isobar', and numbers '2', '3', '4'.
