Delta e_x equals e_x,6 minus e_x,1, which equals u_6 minus u_1 plus (m_2 u_6 minus m_1 u_1 plus (w_2 squared divided by 2 minus w_1 squared divided by 2)). The equation continues with specific values: u(T equals 359.3 K) equals (257.29 minus 270.02) divided by 10 times 0.3 plus 270.02 equals 253.1246. u(T equals 293.75 K) equals (278.28 minus 274.13) divided by 250 minus 240 times 3.75 plus 274.13 equals 273.3823. Delta e_x, isr equals (253.1246 minus 273.3823) times 110,000, resulting in 110.129 kJ/kg.
