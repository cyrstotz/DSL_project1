Perfect gas

Energy balance:

Delta E equals m times (U_2 minus U_1) equals Q minus W

Q_s2 equals m times (U_2 minus U_1) plus W equals seven eight five point three two three equals minus three six six point six three three

V_2 equals m times R times T_2 divided by p_0 equals eleven point one four liters

Volume work isothermal

W equals p_0 times V_0 minus p_c times (U_2 minus U_1) equals minus two eight four point two three

C_v times (T_2 minus T_m) equals minus three one six point one five joules per kilogram

Q equals minus one three six zero point six three three

der T zwei gleich T null
