Energy balance around the nozzle (stationary) leads to

h subscript 5 degree times (w subscript 5 squared divided by 2) equals h6 times (w subscript 6 squared divided by 2)

h subscript 5 equals h at 0.5 bar, 431.9 K

h subscript 5 equals h at T subscript s equals h at 431.9 K

table A-22

h at 490 K minus h at 430 K divided by (490 minus 430) K times (431.9 minus 430 K) plus h at 430 K

table A-22

(449.61 minus 431.93) kJ per kg divided by 10 K times 1.9 K plus 431.93 kJ per kg

equals 433.37 kJ per kg equals h subscript 5

h subscript 6 equals h at 340 K

table A-22

equals 340.42 kJ per kg
