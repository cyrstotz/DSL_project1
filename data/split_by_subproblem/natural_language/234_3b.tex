The equation Tg,2 equals TEW,1 equals 0 degrees Celsius is written.

An explanation follows: the ice-water mixture does not change its temperature due to the heat flow, as it is already in the solid-liquid area, indicating it is isothermal. In equilibrium, gas and ice have the same temperature.

A scribbled diagram is present.

The equation pa2 equals pa1 equals 1.4 bar is written.

A note states: Pressure remains the same because nothing changes in the force equilibrium, only heat was added (see Task 2).
