E exothermic equals m dot exothermic times h zero minus h zero minus T zero times s zero minus s zero  
E exothermic equals m dot exothermic times h zero minus T zero times s zero minus s zero plus n divided by two times u zero squared plus u zero squared plus sigma one minus T zero divided by T zero times Q dot minus sigma W dot  
Delta c x isentropic equals one hundred kilojoules per kilogram  
i exothermic equals one minus T zero divided by T zero times i q b equals one hundred ninety-eight equals one minus two hundred eighty-three Kelvin divided by one thousand two hundred eighty-three Kelvin times one thousand one hundred ninety-five kilojoules per kilogram second equals three hundred sixty-nine point seventy-two kilojoules per kilogram second  

Error  

O equals s zero minus s zero plus q b divided by T zero minus sigma one divided by m dot exothermic  
F dot exothermic equals T zero times s zero  
E dot exothermic equals T zero times s zero  
s zero equals s zero minus s zero plus q b divided by T zero times integral from T zero to T zero c p zero divided by T d T minus R times ln p zero divided by p zero  
R equals R divided by M air  
M air equals twenty-eight point ninety-seven gram per mol  

e x exothermic equals T zero divided by T zero times c p zero times i T zero minus T zero minus T zero times c p zero times ln T zero divided by T zero minus R divided by M air times ln p zero divided by p zero minus q b divided by T zero
