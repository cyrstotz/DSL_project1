A graph is drawn with pressure in bar on the vertical axis and temperature in Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The graph forms a peak labeled "cut".

Below the first graph, there is a second graph with pressure in bar on the vertical axis and temperature in Kelvin on the horizontal axis. This graph has a triangular shape with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.

In Drossel, h2 equals h4.
