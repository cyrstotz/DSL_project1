5 to 6 adiabatic reversal

T6 minus T5 times (p6 divided by p5) to the power of n minus 1 over n equals 431.9.

0.191 divided by 0.5 to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4 equals 328.075 K.

Equation: Q equals m dot c p times (h5 minus h6) plus L plus omega dot.

Equation: ws5 squared minus ws6 squared divided by 2 equals m dot c p times (h6 minus h5).

ws5 squared divided by 2 plus ws6 squared divided by 2 equals m dot c p times (h6 minus h5).

Equation: ws5 squared plus 2 times (h5 minus h6) minus ws6 squared equals square root of ws5 squared plus 2 times (c p times (T5 minus T6) minus ws6 squared) equals 220.474.
