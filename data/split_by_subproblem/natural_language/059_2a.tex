A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled 'T' and the horizontal axis labeled 's'. The graph contains several curves labeled 'isobare' and 'isotrop'. The isobare curves are labeled with different pressures: 'isobare 0.5 bar' and 'isobare 0.191 bar'. Points are marked on the graph as '0', '1', '2', '3', '5', and '6'. The point '1' is labeled 'isotrop', the point '5' is labeled 'isotrop', and the point '6' is labeled 'adiabate'. The temperature at point '0' is approximately '-30Â°C'.
