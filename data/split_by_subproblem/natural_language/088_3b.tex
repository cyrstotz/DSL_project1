T G2 equals 0 degrees Celsius, p G2 equals p amb equals 1.96 bar

Temperature: Since x equals 0, the system is still in equilibrium, and all the supplied heat is used for melting, not for temperature increase, so it remains at the same temperature.

Pressure: Since the external pressure and the mass are constant, p automatically remains constant.
