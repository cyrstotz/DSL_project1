a) 

A graph is shown with a T (temperature) axis and a ρ (density) axis. The graph depicts a rectangular cycle with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The cycle proceeds from point 1 to 2, then to 3, then to 4, and back to 1.

Another graph is shown with a T (temperature) axis and a P (pressure) axis. The graph illustrates a triangular cycle. The cycle includes labels: "isotherm," "isotherm," "isotherm," and "Nutzenergie" (useful energy).

b) 

The equation dT/dt = ṁ (h2 - h3) + Q̇_ev - Ṽ̇_k is written. 

h2 = h(p4, h4g, s2 = s1)

h3 = h(s3 = s2, 1.8 bar)

Ṽ̇_k = -28 W
