ws equals two hundred twenty meters per second  
Ts equals four hundred thirty-one point nine Kelvin  
Ps equals zero point five bar equals fifty kilopascals  

Ebilanz um Schubdüse: Stat. Fließprozessen mit ṁ  
O equals ṁ times [he minus ha plus (we squared minus wa squared) divided by two] plus Q minus W  
O equals ṁ times [hs minus ho plus ws squared minus wo squared divided by two]  

ho minus hs equals ws squared minus wo squared divided by two  

wo squared equals two hs minus two ho plus ws squared  
equals two times (hs minus ho) plus ws squared  
equals two times integral from To to Ts of Cp(T) dT plus ws squared  
equals two Cp times (Ts minus To) plus ws squared  

To über polytropes Temperatur:  
To divided by Ts equals (Po divided by Ps) to the power of n minus one divided by n  
implies To equals Ts times (Po divided by Ps) to the power of fourteen minus one divided by fourteen  
equals three hundred twenty-eight point zero seven Kelvin  

wo squared equals two times one point zero zero six kilojoules per kilogram times (four hundred thirty-one point nine Kelvin minus three hundred twenty-eight point zero seven Kelvin) plus two hundred twenty squared meters squared per seconds squared  

wo equals square root of [two Cp times (Ts minus To) plus ws squared] equals square root of [two times one point zero zero six kilojoules per kilogram times (four hundred thirty-one point nine Kelvin minus three hundred twenty-eight point zero seven Kelvin) plus two hundred twenty squared meters squared per seconds squared]  

wo squared equals forty-eight thousand eight hundred six point nine zero six meters squared per seconds squared  
wo equals two hundred twenty point four seven meters per second

P_g2 equals 49.56 kPa equals 0.4956 bar approximately 0.5 bar

Energy balance around the ice: Closed system:

dE/dt equals Q minus W^0, volume does not change

Delta E equals Delta U plus Delta KE plus Delta PE equals U_2 minus U_1

U_1 ice at x_1 equals 0.6 and T equals 0 from Table 1:

U_1 equals U_f plus x times (U_g minus U_f)

U_g equals U_fert

U_f equals U_flüssig

equals U_f plus x U_g minus x U_f

equals [0.1045 plus 0.6 times (-333.458 plus 0.045)] kJ/kg

equals -200.093 kJ/kg approximately -200.1 kJ/kg

U_2 minus U_1 equals Q_12 implies U_2 equals Q_12 plus m times U_1 specific

U_2 equals 1500 J plus 0.1 kg times (-200.1 kJ/kg)

equals 1500 J minus 20.01 kJ equals 1500 J minus 20010 J

equals -18510 J

U_2 equals -18510 J divided by 0.1 kg equals -185100 J/kg equals -185.100 kJ/kg
