P one equals P ambient plus F over A plus g times (m K plus m E W) equals one hundred thousand plus five point eight one times (thirty-two plus zero point four) over (D squared over two times pi) equals zero point zero zero two five T.

Equals one hundred thousand plus forty thousand zero five nine minus one hundred forty thousand zero five nine Pa.

p V equals m R T, R equals R over M and R equals eight point three one four joules per mole Kelvin.

g times m g equals P one V one times m g over R times T g one equals one hundred forty thousand zero five nine times zero point zero zero three one four times fifty thousand times ten to the power of negative three over eight point three one four times two hundred seventy-three point one five equals zero point zero zero three nine two one kilograms.
