e sub xdr6 equals (h sub 6 minus h sub 0 minus T sub 0 (s sub 6 minus s sub 0) plus w sub 2 squared divided by 2)
e sub xdr0 equals (h sub 0 minus h sub 0 minus T sub 0 (s sub 0 minus s sub 0) plus w sub 0 squared divided by 2)
Delta e sub xst equals (h sub 6 minus h sub 0 plus w sub 2 squared divided by 2 minus w sub 0 squared divided by 2) equals c p (T sub 6 minus T sub 0) plus w sub 2 squared divided by 2 minus w sub 0 squared divided by 2 equals 10.04 kilojoules per kilogram

w sub 0 equals 200 meters per second
w sub 6 equals 5 times 10 to the power of 5
T sub 6 equals 380 Kelvin
T sub 0 equals 30 Kelvin
