Energy balance equation:

Zero equals m dot times (h sub five plus w squared sub five divided by two) minus m dot times (h sub six plus w squared sub six divided by two) minus W dot sub five six

h sub five equals C sub p times T sub five

h sub six equals C sub p times T sub six

v dot plus delta equals v dot new sub T sub six minus integral from n to one of v d p plus delta k e
