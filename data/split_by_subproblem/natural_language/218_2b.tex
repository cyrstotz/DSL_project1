A diagram is drawn showing a rectangle labeled "additional intercooled" with an inlet labeled "220 m/s" and an outlet labeled "w0". The temperature is marked as 431.9 K and 0.191 bar.

Cp = 1.006 kJ/kg*K

Q dot - W dot = 0

w2a = h e - h a + w e squared over 2

wa = square root of w5 - w6 + w e squared over 2 = square root of Cp (T5 - T6) + w e squared over 2

T0 = (p0 over p5) to the power of (n-1 over n) times T5 = (p0 over p5) times (k-1 over k) times T5 = (0.191 over 0.5) times 431.9 K = 328.07 K

wa = square root of (1.006 kJ over kg*K) (431.9 - 328.07) plus (220 m squared over s squared) = 682.79 m/s
