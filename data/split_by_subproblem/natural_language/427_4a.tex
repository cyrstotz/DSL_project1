There is a graph with the y-axis labeled as 'p [bar]' and the x-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The graph shows a line starting at point 1, going up to point 2, then horizontally to point 3, and finally down to point 4. 

- Zustand 1
- Zustand 2
- Zustand 3: p3 equals 8 bar
- Zustand 4: p4 equals 8 bar

T equals 6 K

x equals 1

x4 equals 0
