A diagram is drawn showing a rectangular box with mass flow rates and temperatures labeled on the sides. Inlet mass flow rate is m dot with temperature T i. Outlet mass flow rate is m dot with temperature T o. The heat transfer rate is labeled as Q dot k. The mass flow rate at the return is m R with temperature T r. The pressure at the inlet and outlet is labeled as p two equals p one.

The equation for the energy balance is written as:
dE over dt equals the sum of m dot (h plus ke plus pe) plus the sum of Q dot minus the sum of W dot.

The simplified energy balance equation is written as:
Zero equals m dot sum of m dot (h) plus Q dot k.

The expression for heat transfer rate is given as:
Q dot k equals m dot (h aus minus h ein).

The expression for mass flow rate is given as:
m R equals Q dot k over (h aus minus h ein).
