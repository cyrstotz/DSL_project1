A graph is drawn with an x-axis labeled 'S' with units 'kilojoules per Kelvin' and a y-axis labeled 'T' with units 'Kelvin'. There are several curved lines plotted on the graph. The lines are labeled with terms such as 'Isobare', 'n equals three', and 'n equals one'. Another label on the graph is 'v equals c'. There is also a point labeled 'm equals one fourth'.
