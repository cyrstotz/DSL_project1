Temperature subscript two equals zero degrees Celsius: since the equilibrium is always in the two-phase region, the temperature remains constant and since the whole system is in equilibrium, temperature subscript two equals zero degrees Celsius.

Pressure subscript one equals pressure subscript two equals one point four bar: Since the equilibrium always has the same mass and the volume and the weight of the body remain the same, the pressure also remains constant.
