p_total equals p_atm plus p_ew plus p_u

p_atm equals 1 bar equals 10^5 Pascal

Area of the membrane and the piston.
A equals 7 pi squared equals 2 times pi times 0.05 squared
equals 0.0157 square meters

p_ew equals F divided by A equals 0.1 times 9.81 divided by 0.0157 equals 62.48 Pascal

p_u equals F divided by A equals 32.5 times 9.81 divided by 0.0157 equals 19994.90 Pascal

p_total equals 10^5 Pascal plus 62.48 Pascal plus 19994.9 Pascal

equals 120057.38 Pascal

(1.2 bar)

Ideal gas law: p V equals m R T, therefore, m equals p V divided by R T

R equals R divided by M equals 8.314 divided by 50 equals 0.16628

m equals 0.00314 cubic meters times 120057.38 Pascal divided by 0.16628 times 47 divided by 24 Kelvin times (500 plus 273.15 Kelvin)

equals 7.02 grams

equals 2.93 grams
