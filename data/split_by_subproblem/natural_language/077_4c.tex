x one equals question mark

m dot p beta three a equals four h three n

T two equals minus twenty-two degrees Celsius

x four equals zero implies completely fluid.

x one equals (s one minus s one f) over (s one g minus s one f)

The process is adiabatic with p equals outer pressure

Entropy balance (four to one)

m dot (s four minus s one) plus sum of (Q dot i over T i) plus S dot erz

zero adiabatic
