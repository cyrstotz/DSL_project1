F U F mean temperature

T equals integral from s a to s e of dq over ds equals q w over s a minus s e

Since the dissolver is in the cooling medium
therefore grey equals delta h
therefore ha minus he over s a minus s e equals T out minus T ent over ln (T out over T ent)

Ideal flow, therefore
delta h equals c f C (T out minus T ent)
ds equals c f ln (T out over T ent)

T U F equals 293.12 U
