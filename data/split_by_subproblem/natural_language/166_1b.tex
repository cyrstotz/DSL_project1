T equals the integral of T ds from s2 to s1 equals Q over s2 minus s1 equals 65 kilowatts over s2 minus s1.
Delta S equals delta Q over T.

P one comma zero times A equals m zero times g plus mK times g plus P atm times A. P one comma zero equals m zero times g divided by A plus mK times g divided by A plus P atm. P one comma zero equals. m zero equals P one zero times V g minus one divided by R minus T g minus one. R equals R divided by M g equals zero point one six three cubic meters per kilogram Kelvin.
