w six squared
T six squared
p zero equals 0.191 bar

O equals m ges times (h five minus h six minus one half m omega two squared divided by f plus one over two m omega two squared)

m ges implies O equals i equals (A minus 22 B equals 490 C equals 431.83 times 10 to the power of three D equals 441.61 times 10 to the power of three)

h five equals h (437.9 Kelvin 0.5 bar) equals A minus 22 B equals 490 C equals 437.9 Kelvin minus A

D minus C equals 473 times 364.2 equals 433 times 369 times 10 to the power of three joules per kilogram

h six equals h (0.191 6 bar 328.07 Kelvin) equals

(T six divided by T five equals (P six divided by P five) to the power of n minus 1 divided by n)

equals 0.4 divided by 0.5 equals (0.191 divided by 0.5) to the power of 1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4

equals 1.221
equals 325
A equals 325
C equals 323.37 times 10 to the power of three
320.07 minus 325
D equals 330
D equals 330.34 times 10 to the power of three
equals C plus 320 minus 325 (D minus C) equals 328 times 398.92 joules per kilogram

equals 328.398 times 10 to the power of three joules per kilogram

equals 1 over 2 m omega two squared minus 1 over 2 m omega six squared equals w six squared minus 6 6 plus 1 over 2 m omega six squared

implies omega six squared equals 2 times h five minus h four divided by m plus omega six squared

implies omega six equals square root of 1 over 2 (h five minus h four) plus omega six squared

equals (m equals i equals A) equals 508.26 meters per second
