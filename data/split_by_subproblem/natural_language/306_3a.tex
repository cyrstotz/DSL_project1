A pe w equals A pe nb plus m w g  
A equals (0.1 meters) squared pi  
p e w equals A pe nb m w g divided by A equals (0.1 meters) pi times 10 to the power of 5 plus 32 times 9.81 divided by (0.1 meters) squared pi  

equals 1.1 bar  

A p g equals A pe w plus MEK g  
p g equals A pe w plus m e k g divided by A  

equals 1.1 bar  

m g equals p g times V g divided by p g times T g equals 1.1 bar times 3.19 cubic meters divided by 83.94 divided by 50 times 773.15 equals 2.68 plus g
