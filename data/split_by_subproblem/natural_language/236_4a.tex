E sub c equals one times Q sub zu divided by W sub t equals Q sub zu divided by Q sub ab minus Q sub zu equals Q sub zu divided by Q sub ab.

E sub c equals Q sub k divided by W sub k equals m sub R134a times h sub 2 minus h sub 1 divided by 28 watts.

Energy balance evaporator

Zero equals m dot times h sub 1 minus h sub 2 plus Q dot sub c.

Q dot sub c equals m dot times h sub 2 minus h sub 1.

T in evaporator = Ti minus 6 K = 263.15 K minus 6 K = 257.15 K

Ti from Fig. 5 read: Sublimation point minus 20 degrees Celsius = 253.15 K
