A graph is drawn with axes labeled T (temperature) in Kelvin and s (entropy) in Joules per Kelvin. Points are marked as P1, P2, and P0. The graph shows lines labeled "2 isochoric" and "verdichtet verdÃ¼nnt". There is a note stating "Luft ideales Gas -> Kein Nachkompf" and "Gestrichen Prozess", with an arrow pointing to "W wird geniert".
