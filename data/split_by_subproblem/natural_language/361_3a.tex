Vpa over ppg leads to membrane, pa equals pg.  
pa equals pamb plus m times g over A plus MEW times g over A equals ten to the power of five plus 32.491 times 3.31 over 0.05 equals 14.0398 pa equals 1.4 bar.  
A equals (D over 2) squared times pi.  
pV equals mRT.  
R equals 8.314 over 30.  
m equals FV over RT equals 1.4 times ten to the power of five times 3.49 times ten to the power of negative three over (273.15 plus 300) times 8.314 over 30 equals 53.409 g equals 3.43 times ten to the power of negative two kg equals 3.43 g.
