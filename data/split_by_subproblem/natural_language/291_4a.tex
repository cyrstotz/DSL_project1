x sub 2 equals 1, x sub c equals 0, T sub k equals T sub i minus 6 Kelvin. T sub f equals T sub i minus 10 Kelvin under sublimation speed. T sub i at 5 mbar. T sub isob at 5 mbar equals minus 1 degree. Delta i equals 5 mbar. T sub i equals 9 degrees Celsius equals 282.15 Kelvin.

The diagram shows a graph with pressure in mbar on the y-axis and temperature in degrees Celsius on the x-axis. There are three phases labeled: fl√ºssig (liquid), fest (solid), and gas (gas). The graph includes lines indicating phase changes, with points labeled 'Tripel' (triple) at 0 degrees Celsius and '5 mbar'. An arrow points towards 'T sub 0 degrees Celsius'.
