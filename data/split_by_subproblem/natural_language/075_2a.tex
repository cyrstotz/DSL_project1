A graph is drawn with points labeled from 0 to 6. The x-axis is labeled S with a subscript indicating 'k' and 'j/k'. The y-axis is labeled T with a subscript 'ik'. There are curved lines connecting the points, and annotations such as 'isobar', 'isentrop', and 'senber' are present near the lines. 

An equation is written: 
(T subscript s divided by T subscript 2) is less than 1.
This implies that T subscript 2 is greater than T subscript 2.
