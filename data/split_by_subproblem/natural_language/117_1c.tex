Entropy balance between coolant and reactor:

dS over dt equals Q dot out over T plus S dot external

Both are not closed

Therefore, zero equals Q dot out over T plus S dot external

Therefore, S dot external equals Q dot out over T sub KF equals negative open bracket negative thirty-seven point eight zero eight kilowatts close bracket over two hundred ninety-five kelvin equals zero point seven two eight three kilojoules over kilogram kelvin
