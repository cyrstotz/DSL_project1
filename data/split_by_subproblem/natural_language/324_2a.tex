A graph is drawn with labeled points and lines. It shows a cycle with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The x-axis is labeled as 's (kJ/kg*K)' and 'kJ/kg*K', and the y-axis is labeled as 'T (K)'. The graph includes curves labeled 'p1', 'p2', and 'p0'. There is an arrow pointing to the top of the graph labeled 'neuer idealer Zustand'.
