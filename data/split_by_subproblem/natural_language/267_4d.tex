Efficiency eta Ek is calculated as one minus heat output divided by heat input, resulting in four point two nine nine. Energy equals three point one kilojoules per kilogram from state 1 to 2 (stationary, isothermal). Heat transfer rate Qk is calculated using mass flow rate and enthalpy difference from 2 to 1, resulting in seven hundred twenty point thirty-six watts.
