A graph with axes labeled P and T. The graph shows a curve with points labeled 1, Flüss, 2, Dampf, and 3. There is a line marked Flüss x = 0.

b.2) T two equals negative sixteen degrees Celsius  
h two equals two hundred thirty-seven point seven four kilojoules per kilogram  
p three equals eighty-six Celsius  

s two equals zero point eight two eight eight kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin equals s three  

TAB A twelve, eight bar  
S sat equals zero point nine zero zero six kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin at thirty-one point three three degrees Celsius  
S twenty-four degrees Celsius equals zero point eight three seven four  

Interpolate for T three:  
T three equals
