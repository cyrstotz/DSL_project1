A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled T (K) and the horizontal axis labeled s (kJ/kg K). The graph shows two dotted lines labeled "isentrope" with points marked as 0, 5, and L. The line from point 0 to L is vertical, and from L to 5 is also vertical. The pressures 0.5 bar and 0.1316 bar are marked on the graph.
