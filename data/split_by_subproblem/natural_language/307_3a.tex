T g,1 equals 500 degrees Celsius  
V g,1 equals 3.14 L  
equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of 3 cubic centimeters  

Diagram:  
A rectangle is drawn with arrows pointing downward labeled V pump, m k g divided by A, and m E W g divided by A. An arrow inside the rectangle pointing upward is labeled P g,1.

P g,1 equals P amb plus m k g times g divided by A plus m E W times g divided by A  
A equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of minus 3 square meters  

equals 10 to the power of 5 newtons per square meter plus 313.92 newtons divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of minus 3 square meters plus 0.981 newtons divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of minus 3 square meters equals 14 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals  

equals 1.5 bar  

P g,1 V g,1 equals m g R T g,1  
R equals R bar divided by M g equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  

m g equals P g,1 V g,1 divided by R T g,1 equals 3.42 grams
