Pg equals Pgesammt plus Pw. Pgesammt equals m times g divided by A equals 9 times bar equals 3505.52 Pascal, with A equals D divided by 2 times pi times r squared. Pw equals m times g divided by A equals 0.045 Pascal. Pg equals 1.1 bar. mg equals Pg times Vg divided by rg equals 3.4 times 10 to the power of minus 3 kg equals 3.4 g. Rg equals R divided by mg equals 0.42 times kg divided by rg times k.
