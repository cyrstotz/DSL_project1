T sub g,2, p sub g,2

T sub g,2 equals T sub ew,2. Since there is still ice in the ice-water mixture, the temperature is still at T sub ew,1.

T sub g,2 equals 0 degrees Celsius

v sub const equals m sub const times R sub const implies p sub 1 divided by T sub 1 equals p sub 2 divided by T sub 2 equals p sub g,2 divided by T sub g,2 equals 140094 pascals divided by 773.15 kelvin equals 273.15 kelvin

p sub g,2 equals 0.495 bar
