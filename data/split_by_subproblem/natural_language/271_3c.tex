Energy balance in the flow process

Q equals m times L zero minus s a plus Q out divided by T plus S zero two

S zero two equals minus m times L zero minus s a minus Q out divided by T

Ideal fluidity

s a minus s c equals c fluid times ln of T two divided by T one

Energy balance in the ideal fluidity

Q equals m times h two minus h one plus Q out

m equals minus Q out divided by h two minus h one

equals Q out divided by h u minus h c

h u minus h c equals c fluid times T zero two minus T zero one

m equals Q out divided by c fluid times T zero two minus T zero one

S zero two equals minus Q out divided by c fluid times T zero two minus T zero one times f divided by c fluid times ln of T two divided by T one minus Q out divided by T

equals minus six hundred twenty-three point two kilojoules
