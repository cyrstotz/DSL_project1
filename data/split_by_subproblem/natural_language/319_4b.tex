The equation is given as the derivative of energy with respect to time: dE/dt equals the sum of mass flow rates times the enthalpy plus kinetic energy plus potential energy plus the sum of heat added minus the sum of work done. Specifically, it is written as:
dE/dt = Σṁi(hi + kei + pei) + ΣQ̇ - ΣẆ

Then it continues with:
0 = ṁRaus(h2 - h3) + 28W

There are additional notes and calculations indicating the process between states 2 and 3:
h2 = h3(Ti - Ti-64K) = 
h3 = hKunter
S2 = S3 ⇒ rückwärts interpolieren für h3
