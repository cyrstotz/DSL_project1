A diagram is drawn on a graph with axes labeled 'T [K]' and 's [kJ/kg]'. The diagram includes a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Arrows indicate the direction of the process. The curve between points 1 and 2 is labeled 'isobar', and between points 5 and 6 is also labeled 'isobar'. Annotations on the diagram include 'P6 = P0 - 0.1% bar' and 'P5 = 0.5 bar'.
