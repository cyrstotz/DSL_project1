h2, h out plus v (h out minus h f) at 10 Celsius equals 252.38 plus 0.005 (2626.8 minus 252.38)

equals 304.64

h2 equals 448.04 plus 0.005 (2676.1 minus 448.04) equals 430.32

Q out equals m (h out minus h2) plus Q in minus Q out

Q out equals m (h out minus h2) plus Q in equals 0.3 (304.64 minus 430.32) plus 1000 kW

equals 62.236 kW

equals 62.3 kW

A graph labeled "T L kJ/kg" on the vertical axis and "s kJ/kg K" on the horizontal axis is drawn. The graph shows a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The curve is annotated with "isobar" between points 1 and 2, and points 3 and 4, and "isotherm" between points 2 and 3. There are annotations "p2 = p3" and "p2 = p4 = p5" along the curve.

W equals m dot times (h3 minus h2)  
m dot equals W divided by (h3 minus h2) equals 28 times 10 to the power of minus 3 times L divided by (268.82 minus 243.72) equals 0.00 times 0.15 kilograms per second
