A graph is shown with axes labeled 'P' and 'T'. The graph includes a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. There are annotations such as "gerade udl stetig" and "isobare" written near the curve. The section between points 2 and 3 is labeled "isobar", and the section between points 3 and 4 is labeled "isentrop". The graph is divided into segments with different annotations indicating changes in pressure and temperature.
