The equations and expressions are as follows:

- "w6, T6"
- "0 = ṁ(h5 - h6 + w5 squared over 2 - w6 squared over 2) = -Ẇ56"
- "with Ẇ56 over ṁ = - ∫ from 5 to 6 v dp + Δpe isobar"
- "h5 - h6 + w5 squared over 2 - w6 squared over 2 = 0"
- "w6 squared over 2 = (h6 - h5) + w5 squared over 2 = 2 cp (T6 - T5) + w5 squared over 2"
- "T6 = T5 (P6 over P5) raised to the power of (n-1 over n) = 328.07 K"
