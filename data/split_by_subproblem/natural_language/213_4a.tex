A graph is depicted with pressure on the y-axis labeled as 'p' in bar and temperature on the x-axis labeled as 'T' in kilojoules. The graph shows a curve labeled 'Sättigung', with a marked region indicating 'Flüssig' and 'Gas'. Two points are labeled on the graph as '1' and '2' with a connecting line labeled 'Isobar' and a horizontal line with a label 'Isotherm'. Another point is labeled '3' on the curve. A scale indicating '10 K' is shown below the graph.
