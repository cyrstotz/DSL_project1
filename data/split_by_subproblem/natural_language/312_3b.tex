The temperature and the pressure remain constant:

T sub EW comma 2 equals T sub EW comma 1 equals 0 degrees Celsius strikethrough

p sub G comma 2 equals p sub G comma 1 equals p sub amb plus M sub kolben times g divided by pi times open parenthesis D divided by 2 close parenthesis squared equals 133570 Pa equals 1.3357 bar strikethrough

This is because we are in a two-phase area where a heat supply leads to a temperature and pressure increase when the entire ice is melted. This is not the case with x sub Eis comma 2 greater than 0.

The temperature is 0 degrees Celsius because the ice is not completely melted (x sub Eis comma 2 greater than 0) and the T sub Eis comma 2 temperature of the ice therefore remains constant.

So that no heat is transferred, T sub G comma 2 equals T sub Eis comma 2 equals 0 applies. The pressure also remains constant because the atmospheric pressure and the weight of the piston as well as the water-ice mixture remain constant.
