A graph is drawn with points labeled O, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5', and 6. There are lines connecting these points with labels P2, P5 equals 0.5 bar, and P0. The graph is titled T1, T0 on the vertical axis and S equals w3 over w2 on the horizontal axis.

Delta e x, str equals e D equals D h zero minus h zero minus T zero times (s six minus s zero) plus Delta KE.

Delta ke equals omega squared divided by two minus omega c squared divided by two.

Delta e x, str equals c p times (T six minus T zero) minus T zero times (c p times ln(T six divided by T one)) plus omega c squared minus omega c squared divided by two.

Delta e x, str equals one thousand six divided by four point five times (three hundred twenty five point zero four minus two hundred forty three point one five) minus two hundred forty three point one five times k times (one thousand six divided by four point five times k times ln(three hundred twenty five point zero four divided by two hundred forty three point one five times k)) plus five hundred omega squared minus two hundred omega squared divided by two.

Delta e x, str equals one hundred twenty two point two omega squared divided by kg.
