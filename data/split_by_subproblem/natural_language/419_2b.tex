T log equals integral from T in to T out d s over s in minus s out

equals h out minus h in over s out minus s in equals

equals h out minus h in over ln (T out over T in)

equals 293.75 K

- "4 → 5 isobar"
- "4 → 5 isochor"

Below these annotations, several equations and expressions are written:

- "wb, Tb"
- "p3, p4, T5"
- "p06 - p0 = 0.75 + Bc"
- "Lücke:"
- "Tb/T5 = (p06/p5)^(n-1/n)"
- "n = k = 1.4"
- "Tb = T5 (p06/p5)^(n-1/n)"
- "Tb = 437.9 K (0.931 * 10^5 / 0.5 * 10^5)^(0.4/1.4)"
- " = 328.07 K"
- "T0 = 328.07 K"

Further down, there are more equations and expressions:

- "wb:"
- "df/dt = Σm (hci - hei) + Q - W"
- "Q = Σm (hi + 0.5 * c^2)"
- "Q = m (h5 - h6 + 220^2/2 - w6^2/2)"
- "Q = m (cp (T5 - Tb) + 220^2/2 - w6^2/2)"
- "m dot / n = 5.283"
- "qB = Q13/m dot = 1.85"
