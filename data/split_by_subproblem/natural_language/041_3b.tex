Thermodynamic equilibrium in state 2  
Tg,2 equals TEW,2  
Since the temperature in the solid-liquid range remains constant  
TEW,2 equals TEW,1 thus Tg,2 equals TEW,1 equals 0 degrees Celsius  

ps2 equals ps1 equals 0.4 bar  

Since no mass is lost and the area remains the same, thus the same mass still presses on the same area.

u2 equals uz divided by mew.

u2 equals
