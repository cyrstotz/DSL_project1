P sub g1, M sub g

A equals pi times r squared minus 0.031415 meters squared

P equals F times P

P sub g equals A times the quantity (0.1 kilograms plus 32 kilograms) times g plus 1 bar

equals 0.031415 meters squared times (32 kilograms divided by kilogram) times 9.81 meters per second squared plus 10 to the power of 5 pascal

equals 100003.893 pascal

M sub g equals 50 kilograms per kilomole

V equals 3.14 L equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 meters cubed

T equals 500 degrees Celsius equals 773.15 Kelvin

P sub g times V sub g divided by R times T equals M

equals 100003.893 pascal times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 meters cubed times 50 kilograms per kilomole divided by 8.314 Joules per kilomole times 773.15 Kelvin equals 2.44 grams
