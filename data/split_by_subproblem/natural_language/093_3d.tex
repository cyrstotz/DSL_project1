Isentropic balance for E W

W times (u two minus u one) plus Q two equals zero (no work because v equals constant) calculation compression

p zero times v zero (bar)

u two equals x two times u rest plus x two times (u rest)

u one equals u rest minus x one times (u focusing u rest)

u rest equals u rest times (m bar) plus one point nine minus one point one bar times u rest times (two bar minus u rest) divided by (two minus one point zero bar)
