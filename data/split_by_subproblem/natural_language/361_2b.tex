Steady flow process:
0 equals m-dot times (he minus ha plus (wc squared minus wa squared over 2)) plus Q-dot minus W-dot.

This implies:
m-dot times cp times (Tz minus Ta) plus wc squared over 2 equals m-dot times wa squared over 2.

he minus ha equals the integral from 0 to T of cp dT equals cp times (Tz minus Ta).

An adiabatic process is indicated:
T0 over Ts equals (rho e over rho) to the power of kappa minus 1 over kappa, leading to Te equals (834.9) times (0.191 over 0.5) to the power of 0.286 equals 323.075 K.

wc squared equals 2 times [cp times (Tz minus Ta) minus wa squared over 2] equals 257.28.

wa squared equals 507.24 meters squared per second squared.
