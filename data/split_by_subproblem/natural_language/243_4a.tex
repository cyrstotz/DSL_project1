Two graphs are drawn. The first graph has the y-axis labeled as 'p(kpa)' and the x-axis labeled as 'T(K)'. The curve is labeled with 'flüssig', 'Nass-Dampf', and 'Dampf'. The second graph has the y-axis labeled as 'p(kpa)' and the x-axis labeled as 'T(Celsius)'. The curve is labeled with 'Flüssig', 'Ti', and 'Flüssig'.
