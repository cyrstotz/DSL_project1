Equation: Q̇_k equals ṁ times [h_e minus h_a]
Therefore, Q̇_k equals ṁ times [h_2 minus h_1]

List of variables:
h_1
h_2

For the transition from 2 to 3, s equals constant
s_2 equals s_3
s_j at 8 bar

For the transition from 2 to 3, W_k equals 28 W

Equation: ṁ times [h_2 minus h_3] equals 28 W

ii) Condensation of the refrigerant
- at 466.5
- at 1 mbar
- at 273.15 K

10 K below the boiling point
- at -30°C
- at 243.15 K equals T_1

Temperature of the environment equals 237.15 K
