A equals open parenthesis 0.05 meters close parenthesis squared equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 meters squared.

P open parenthesis t close parenthesis equals 1 bar plus open parenthesis 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 meters squared close parenthesis plus open parenthesis 9.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 meters squared close parenthesis equals 140000 pascal equals 1.4 bar.

p times V equals m times R times T arrow m equals p times V divided by R times T.

Q equals R divided by M equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole per kelvin divided by 50 joules per kilomole equals 0.1663 joules per kilogram per kelvin.

m sub g equals 140000 pascal times 0.00514 meters cubed divided by 0.1663 joules per kilogram per kelvin times 773.15 kelvin equals 3.1 times 2 grams.
