A graph is drawn with T (K) on the vertical axis and S (kJ/kg) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts a closed loop with six points labeled 1 through 6. The segments between points are labeled as follows: 1 to 2 is labeled "isobar," 2 to 3 is labeled "isentropic," 4 to 5 is labeled "isobar," and 5 to 6 is labeled "isentropic."
