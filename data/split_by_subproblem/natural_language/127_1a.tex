Zero equals m dot out times the difference of h out minus h in plus Q dot out.  

Q dot equals m dot out times the sum of h out plus h in.  

Q dot equals Q1 times the sum of 4619.04 plus 2922.98.  

Equals 237.1874.

Delta E equals m two u two minus m one u one equals Delta m two times h one plus Q aus.  

Delta m two equals m two u two minus m one u one minus Q aus over n one equals

A graph is drawn with a vertical axis labeled '25' at the top and 'a)' at the bottom, and a horizontal axis labeled 's'. The graph has several curves and lines. Points are labeled as follows: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7'. The curves are labeled with 'P_0', 'P_5', 'P_7', and 'P_213'. Two lines are labeled 'isentrop' and 'isobar'. The vertical axis is labeled with '[u]' and the horizontal axis is labeled with '[u / (kg K)]'.
