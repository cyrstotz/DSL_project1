A graph with a y-axis labeled 'ρ' and an x-axis labeled 'T'. The graph shows three regions: 'Fest', 'Flüssig', and 'gas'. There is a curve labeled 'gotoren' transitioning from 'Fest' to 'Flüssig', with a point labeled 'Schluss' on the line between 'Flüssig' and 'gas'. Another line labeled 'noch nicht gotoren' is drawn above the curve.
