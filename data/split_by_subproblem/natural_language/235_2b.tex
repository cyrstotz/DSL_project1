Energy balance of the entire turbine:
dF/dt = sum over i of m dot i times (hi plus ke i plus pe i) plus sum over j of Q dot j minus sum over n of X dot n (adiabat).

0 = m dot ges times (h6 minus h6) plus (w0 squared minus w6 squared) divided by 2.

5 to 6 isentrop:
T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n.

T6 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n times T5 equals 328.07 K.
