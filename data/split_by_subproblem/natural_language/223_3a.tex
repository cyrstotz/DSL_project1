Tg1 = 500 degrees Celsius, Vg1 = 3.14 L - 3.14 times 10 to the power of -3 cubic meters = 0.00314 cubic meters. Cv = 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, Mg = 50 kilograms per kilomole. 

-c R = R divided by Mg = 8.314 joules per mole Kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole = 166.28 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

-p V = R T → p V divided by m = R T → p = R T m divided by V

Druckbilanz:

Pg = M divided by pi times seconds squared plus 32 kilograms divided by pi times seconds squared plus 1 bar.

Pg1 = 1 bar plus 0.12 bar plus 39.37 bar = 40.49 bar.

mg1 = R Tg1 divided by pg1 Vg1 = 166.28 joules per kilogram Kelvin divided by 115 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 0.00314 cubic meters = 772.
