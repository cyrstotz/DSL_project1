A equals pi times D squared divided by 4 equals 0.007854 cubic meters.

rho equals m_EV divided by A plus m_G divided by A plus p_0 equals 1.4 bar.

p_02 divided by p_01 equals V_01 divided by V_02 times M_G divided by T_01.

V_02 divided by m_G equals V_01 divided by m_G.

m_G equals 0.109 kilograms.
