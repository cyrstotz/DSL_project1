Diagram: A graph showing T [K] on the vertical axis and s [kJ/kg K] on the horizontal axis. The graph includes several curved lines and arrows indicating different states. The states are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The pressure values are indicated as 0.5 bar and 0.191 bar. There is a note next to the graph stating "(isobare etwas zu steil skizziert)".
