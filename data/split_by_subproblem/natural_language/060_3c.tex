Entropy balance:
Zero equals n times s subscript sc minus s subscript scr plus the sum of Q subscript j divided by T subscript j plus s subscript scr.
Therefore, negative s subscript scr equals 83.3 times Q subscript j divided by T subscript j equals 39.96 divided by 295 equals 0.3388 k squared divided by s divided by k equals 0.3388 kilowatt divided by k.

E2 minus E1 equals EQj minus epsilon W2m
E2 minus E1 equals Q12
