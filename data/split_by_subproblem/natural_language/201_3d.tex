Q12 is equal to 1.5 times D

GS: X Eis,2

TEW,2 is equal to TEW,1

Q12 is equal to m2 times u2 minus m1 times u1

mEW,2 is equal to mEW,1 times X12

u2 is equal to uf plus X Eis,1 times (ufest minus uf) fest

b) bei 0 degrees Celsius und Druck p Eis,1 is equal to pamb plus m times g divided by (D divided by 2) squared times pi is equal to 1.9 bar

uf is equal to minus 0.045 kilojoules per kilogram, ufest is equal to minus 333.458 kilojoules per kilogram

Therefore, u1 is equal to minus 200.00 kilojoules per kilogram

Therefore, Q12 is equal to mEW,1 times (u2 minus u1)

Therefore, Q12 divided by mEW,1 is equal to u2 minus u1, therefore Q12 divided by mEW,1 plus u1 is equal to u2

u2 is equal to minus 785.09 kilojoules per kilogram

Therefore, u2 is equal to uf plus X Eis,2 times (ufest minus uf) at the same temperature and pressure

Therefore, u2 minus uf divided by ufest minus uf is equal to X Eis,2 is equal to 0.555
