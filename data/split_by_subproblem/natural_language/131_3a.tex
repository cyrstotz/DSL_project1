p1 V1 is equal to m1 R T1, R is equal to R divided by 14 kg.

p1,1 is equal to Kraft, 32 kg times 5.6 meter per second squared divided by Fl√§che, 5 centimeter squared times pi, plus 1 bar equals 32 kg times 5.6 meter per second squared divided by t centimeter squared times pi, plus 1.105 equals 35565.5 Pascal plus 10000 Pascal, equals 135565.5 Pascal.

Therefore, m3,1 equals p3,1 V3,1 divided by R T3,1. Equals 135565.5 Pascal times 3.141 times 10 to the power of minus 3 divided by 8.314 times 7.73.15 Kelvin times 10 to the power of minus 3 equals 3.449 equals 0.003445 kg.
