ses: T - s Diagram

A graph is depicted with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph includes several points and lines:

- Points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and e are marked on the graph.
- Lines between the points are labeled with conditions such as "p = const" and "s = const".
- The line from point 4 to point 5 is marked "T = const".
- The line from point 2 to point 3 is marked "s = const".
- The line from point 5 to point e is marked "s = const" with a spring-like symbol.
- Temperatures are marked on the graph: 128.9 Kelvin and 431.9 Kelvin.
- A value of negative 30 degrees Celsius equals 243.15 Kelvin is noted.
- The region is marked with "Po" and "Pe" at different locations.

Additional notes:
- "Luft ideales Gas" is written, which translates to "air ideal gas".
- An arrow points to a note that says "keine 'Stotke'", meaning "no 'shock'".
