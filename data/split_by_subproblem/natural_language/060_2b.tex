b) Gas: P6, O6

w_s = 220 meters per second  
p_c = 0.5 bar  
T_6 = 431.9 Kelvin

adiabatic:  
T_2 / T_1 = (p_2 / p_1) to the power of ((n-1)/n)  
=> T_6 / T_5 = (p_c / p_5) to the power of ((n-1)/n)  
=> T_6 = 431.9 (0.191 times 10^5 / 0.5 times 10^5) to the power of (1.4-1/1.4) = 328.07 Kelvin = 328.1 Kelvin

w_0^2 = w_c^2 - w_2^2

stationary flow process:  
0 = m_dot [h_e - h_a + (w_c^2 - w_2^2) / 2] = h_e - h_a + (w_c^2 - w_2^2) / 2 = 0

h_e - h_a = integral from T_1 to T_6 of c_p(T) dt = c_p (328.1 - 431.9) = -104.1 (278.8)

0 = w_c^2 + w_2^2 / 2 = 1041472.8  
=> 2 (1041472.8 - w_2^2) = w_0^2 = 760444  
w_0 = sqrt(760.444) = 400.55 meters per second
