P zero equals P zero T plus N g divided by A plus m dot divided by delta equals seven point zero five P zero plus (32 times 1.0 times 1.5) divided by (10.1 times 1 squared) pi equals 1.16 m.  
m dot equals P zero times V zero divided by R times T zero equals P zero times V zero divided by R divided by M times T zero equals 7.5 times 10 cubed times 0.003714 meters cubed equals 0.00366 kilograms.
