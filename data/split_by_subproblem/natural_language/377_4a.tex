p [bar]

8 bar

T [degrees C]

Diagram:
- A graph with pressure (p) on the vertical axis labeled in bar, and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis labeled in degrees Celsius.
- The graph shows a cycle with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- The cycle includes processes labeled "isobar", "adiabatic", and "adiabatic (reversible)". 
- The pressure starts at 8 bar, with lines connecting the points in the cycle.
