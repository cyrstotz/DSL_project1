p1, mg, gas

Cv = 0.1663 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin
Mg = 50 kilograms per square meter

Tg = 500 degrees Celsius = 773.15 Kelvin
Vg1 = 3.14 L = 0.00314 cubic meters

p = mRT / Vg1

A = (pi / 2) times (0.05 meters squared) squared = 7.854 times 10 to the power of minus 3 square meters

p = F / A
p = pamb plus (32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared) divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of minus 3 square meters
= 100000 pascals plus 39469.1 pascals = 1.3947 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals = p1

M = pV / RT
R = R / M = 0.1663

M = (1.3947 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 0.00314 cubic meters) divided by (0.1663 times 773.15 Kelvin) = 3.418 times 10 to the power of minus 3 kilograms
= 3.418 grams
