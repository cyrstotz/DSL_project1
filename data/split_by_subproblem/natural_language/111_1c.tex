Delta e existing equals h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus (w_6 squared minus w_0 squared) divided by two.

Equals c_p times (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 times (c_p times ln(T_6 divided by T_0) minus R times ln(p_6 divided by p_0)) plus (w_6 squared minus w_0 squared) divided by two.

Equals 1.006 times (340 minus 243.15) minus 243.15 times 1.006 times ln(340 divided by 243.15) plus (510 squared minus 200 squared) divided by two times 10 to the power of minus 3.

Equals 125.1472 kilojoules per kilogram.
