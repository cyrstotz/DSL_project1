Delta S equals m one y one plus delta m one two minus m two y two s one.

Negative delta m one two equals s one equals one point five zero six plus zero point zero zero five times seven point five five four nine minus one point five zero six five equals one point three three seven one four kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

s two equals s (seventy degrees Celsius, x equals one) equals seven point seven five five three.

Negative delta S equals five seven five five plus three six zero zero times seven point seven five five three minus five seven five five times one point three three seven one four equals sixty six thousand two hundred thirty point three eight kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
