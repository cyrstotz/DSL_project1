E dot x, verl equals T bar KF times s dot zero e, therefore s dot zero e equals E dot x, verl over T bar KF.

E dot x, verl equals m dot times [h e in minus h out minus T bar KF times (s e in minus s e out)] plus E dot x, Q.

The internal temperature would no longer decrease according to the second law of thermodynamics.
