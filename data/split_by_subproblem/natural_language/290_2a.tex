Time curve

A graph is drawn with an x-axis labeled "s [kJ/kg K]" and a y-axis labeled "T [K]". The graph includes a wavy line and several points marked as follows:
- Point 0 at the origin
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3
- Point 4
- Point 5
- Point 6
- Lines are drawn connecting these points in a sequence, with pressure relationships indicated: P3 equals P5, P5 equals P7, P3 equals P4, and P5 equals P4.
