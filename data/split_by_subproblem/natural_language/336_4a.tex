a) A graph is shown with axes labeled P (pressure) in bar and T (temperature) in Kelvin. The graph includes curves labeled "Isotherme Expansion," "Isobare Abkühlung," and a point labeled "Tripelpunkt." There are lines indicating states labeled "flüssig" (liquid), "fest" (solid), and "gas" (gas). The graph shows a line from point 1 to point 2 with a ΔT of 100 K, and a line from point 3 to point 4 at 0.5 bar.

b) The equation is written as:
dE/dt = Σṁi (hi + vi^2/2 + gzi) + ΣQ - ΣW

ΣQi - ΣWi = Qk - Qab = Wk - 28 W
Adiabatic

c) A diagram illustrates a cycle with two arrows pointing in opposite directions. The following annotations are present: 
m = qvz
Π4 = T(8 bar) = 31.33°C
x = 0
p = 8 bar
