Energy balance:  
m dot e v s times (h s minus h 6 plus k e s minus k e 6) equals 0

Entropy balance for reversible process  
Polytropic coefficient

T6 over T5 equals (P6 over P5) raised to the power of n minus 1 over n  
T6 equals (P6 over P5) raised to the power of n minus 1 over n  
T5 equals 328.0747 K

h s minus h 6 plus one half w s squared minus one half w 6 squared equals 0

W6 squared equals two times (h s minus h 6) plus w s squared  
equals square root of two times c p times (T5 minus T6) plus w s squared  
equals square root of two times 1006 times (103.8) times 1000 plus 220 squared  
equals 507.25 meters per second
