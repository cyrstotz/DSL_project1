From Table A-2 we have interpolated the internal energy:

u interior equals 0.005 times u two (T equals 400) plus 0.995 times u two (T equals 100) equals 423.37

u exterior equals u two (T equals 70) equals 292.85

u in equals u two (T equals 20) equals 83.55

Therefore, m one u one plus m two u in equals (m one plus m two) u exterior 2 therefore

m one u one plus m two u in equals m one u exterior plus m two u exterior therefore m one (u two minus u one) equals m two (u exterior minus u in) therefore

m one two equals m one times (u exterior minus u in) divided by (u two minus u one) equals 549.2 kilograms
