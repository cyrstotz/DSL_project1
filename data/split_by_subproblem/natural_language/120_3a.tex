Given: P1g, mg

Diagram: A cylinder with arrows indicating pressure P1 and mass mg. The top of the cylinder is labeled P_eis, and the bottom is labeled P_gas.

P_eis = P_gas as equilibrium.

Equation: 
P_a plus m divided by A equals P_eis.

Calculation:
1.10 to the power of 5 plus 32 times 3.81 minus P_eis equals 1.399969 bar.

P1g = 1.4 bar.

mg equals P1 times V divided by R times T1.

R equals R bar divided by M equals 8314 divided by 50 equals 166.28.

mg equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 times 3.14 times 0.001 minus 0.003418 kg equals 3.4189 divided by 166.28 times (500 plus 273.15).
