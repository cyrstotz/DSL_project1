A graph is depicted with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 'S [kJ/kg]'. The graph shows a series of points connected by lines, labeled sequentially from 0 to 6. The points are connected in the following order: 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6. There is a label 'T_HS' near the line connecting point 0 and point 1. The lines appear to represent different processes:

- 0 to 1: Î· < 1
- 1 to 2: isentropic
- 2 to 3: isobaric
- 3 to 4: adiabatic non-reversible
- 4 to 5: isobaric
- 5 to 6: isentropic

There is also a note that p6 equals p1 equals p4. The graph shows dashed lines that seem to represent different pressure levels labeled as p0, p1, and p2.
