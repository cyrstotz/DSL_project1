Sought: P1 and mg  

Given: Tgas equals 500 degrees Celsius equals 773.15 Kelvin  
Vgas equals 3.1 liters equals 0.0031 cubic meters  

Diagram: A rectangle with arrows pointing down labeled p0 and an arrow pointing up labeled P1  

Equation:  
P1 times A equals p0 times A plus mkg times g plus mew times g  

P1 equals p0 plus mkg times g over A plus mew times g over A  

A equals D squared over 4 times pi  

P1 equals 100,000 pascals over 1 bar plus 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared over D squared over 4 times pi plus 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared over D squared over 4 times pi  

Result: P1 equals 5.01 bar  

Equation: mg equals P times V over R times T equals 0.255 kilograms
