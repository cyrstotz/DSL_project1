A graph is shown with axes labeled T (K) and S (kJ/K). The graph has points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with lines connecting these points. The points are labeled as follows:
- Point 0 is at 243.15 K.
- Point 1 is at 431.9 K.
- Point 2.
- Point 3 is labeled P z.
- Point 4.
- Point 5.
- Point 6.

The graph indicates 0.5 bar and 0.491 bar. There are equations:
- s1 equals s2
- pz equals p3
- s3 equals s4
- p1 equals p4 equals p5
- p6 equals p0
- s5 equals s6
