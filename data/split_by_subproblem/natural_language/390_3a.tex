A diagram is shown with labels: p1, Fg, FgEV, A, D1. It depicts a cylinder with forces and pressure acting on it.

p1 equals the pressure plus Fg divided by A plus FgEV divided by A.

A equals 8.95 square centimeters times pi equals 28.1 square centimeters.

p1 equals 1.6 kilograms plus 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared times 1 divided by 2.8 times 10 to the power of negative 4 square meters plus 0.12 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 28.1 times 10 to the power of negative 4 square meters.

Equals 1.105 times 10 to the power of 4 equals 3596.5 grams per Newton per square meter plus 724.5 Newtons per square meter equals 1.490 bar.

mg equals p times V equals m times T implies mg equals R times T times V1 divided by D1 times Vg1 equals R divided by M times Vg1 divided by p1 times Vg1.

Equals R times T times Vg1 divided by D1 times Tg1 equals R divided by M times Vg1 divided by p1 times Vg1 equals R times T times Vg1 divided by D1 times Tg1.

Equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 4 times 3.74 times 10 to the power of negative 3 divided by 2.372 times 10 to the power of negative 3 times 50 kilograms equals 7.37.75 Kelvin equals 0.003479 kilograms equals 3.479.
