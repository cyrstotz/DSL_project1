w zero question mark, T zero question mark

Since subsonic isentropic:

(P two over P one) to the power of n minus one over n equals T two over T one  
T two equals four hundred thirty one point nine times (zero point one five one times ten to the fifth over zero point five times ten to the fifth) to the power of one point four minus one over one point four equals three hundred twenty eight point zero seven five Kelvin  

Where T two equals T G equals three hundred twenty eight point zero seven five Kelvin  

We take w squared over two equals work done  
N w zero equals R T times ln(P two over P one) equals eight point three one four over two hundred eighty seven point zero five times four hundred thirty one point nine Kelvin times ln(zero point one five one bar over zero point five bar) equals negative one hundred eighteen point two eight zero kilojoules  

Therefore, we calculate:

Square root of negative one hundred fifteen point two eight zero times negative four hundred thirty one point nine times two equals w zero equals four hundred eighty eight point four two three meters per second
