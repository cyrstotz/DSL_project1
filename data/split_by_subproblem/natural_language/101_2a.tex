A graph is drawn with T (K) on the vertical axis and S (kJ/kgÂ·K) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The following labels are associated with the points:
1 isentrop
2 isentrop
3 isotherm

5 isobar
6 isentrop

Additional notes on the graph:
- The line from 3 to 4 is labeled isotherm.
- The line from 4 to 5 is labeled isobar.
- The line from 5 to 6 is labeled isentrop.
