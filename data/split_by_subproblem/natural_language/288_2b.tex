A rectangle is drawn with arrows pointing to the left and right, labeled with 0 and 6. Below it, there is an equation: zero equals m dot ES bracket h0 minus h6 plus u squared FT over 2 minus u squared 6 over 2 bracket plus Q dot 16 superscript zero minus L dot 16 superscript zero. Another set of equations is bracketed: zero equals m dot ES bracket h5 minus h6 plus u squared 5 over 2 minus u squared 6 over 2 bracket plus Q dot SG superscript zero minus L dot SG superscript zero. A diagram resembling a nozzle is drawn with arrows pointing left and right, labeled with 5 and 6.
