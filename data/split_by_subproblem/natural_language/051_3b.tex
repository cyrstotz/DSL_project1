As long as x_ice,2 is greater than 0, ice is present, and the temperature is 0 degrees Celsius, since all the supplied heat flows into the phase transition to water (liquid) and does not result in a temperature change. Therefore, the temperature must be at the melting point. T_g,2 equals T_m,2 equals according to thermodynamic equilibrium!

The pressure p_g2 remains the same as in state 1, so p_g2 equals p_g1 equals 1.9 bar. This is because neither the external pressure nor the mass (m_k plus m_w) have changed.

T_g,2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.

p_g2 equals 1.910 bar equals p_g1.
