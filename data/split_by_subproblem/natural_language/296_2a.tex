A diagram is shown with axes labeled T in brackets K and S in brackets R over R. The diagram includes a curve with points labeled from 1 to 6. Arrows indicate directions between these points with labels such as 'adiabatic reversible', 'adiabatic irreversible', 'm k', 'm m', '0.5 bar', '0.19-0.5 bar', and 'adiabatic P less than 1'.
