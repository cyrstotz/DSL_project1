O is defined as sin of s sub c minus s sub q plus Q divided by T sub g plus s sub q. S sub c minus sin of s sub q minus s sub c divided by T sub g equals 0.7056 minus Q sub g divided by T sub g equals 0.7056 plus 61.182 divided by 275 equals 0.3764163 divided by 0.7056 equals 3.76.39 divided by 0.7056.

Delta e ex, str equals e ex, str 6 minus e ex, str 0 equals h 6 minus h 0 minus T 0 times (s 6 minus s 0) plus w 6 squared divided by 2 minus w 0 squared divided by 2.

h 6 minus h 0 equals c p times (T 6 minus T 0) equals 719,608 kilojoules per kilogram.

s 6 minus s 0 equals c p times the natural logarithm of (T 6 divided by T 0) minus R L g times (P 6 divided by P 0) equals 0,927905 kilojoules per kilogram.

w 0 squared divided by 2 equals 20 kilojoules per kilogram.

w 6 squared divided by 2 equals 1487,8 kilojoules per kilogram.

Delta e ex, str equals 1489,21 kilojoules per kilogram.

Delta E equals m two u two minus m one u one equals Q minus W equals zero.
