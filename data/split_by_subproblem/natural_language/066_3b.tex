1) p02, p01, mg.
- Equilibrium: Apg equals Apo minus mg.
p02 equals p01 plus mg divided by A with A equals pi times D squared divided by 4 equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.
p02 equals 1 bar plus 29 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 857 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.
p02 equals 1 bar plus g equals 4 bar.
Therefore, p02 equals 1.4 bar.

2) p1 times V1 equals mg times R times T.
mg equals p1 times V1 divided by R times T, with R equals 8.314 divided by 50 equals 0.16628 joules per gram Kelvin.
A equals pi times D squared divided by 4 times 0.02314 equals 3.42 grams.
mo equals 166.98 minus 73.15.

b) x equals mo divided by mkg equals 0.6 (state 4).
Equilibrium TGE, p02, p03.
p02 remains constant because the ELW is incompressible and thus only the block and panel determine p02.
TGE pulls the panel to balance the weight.

c) Equilibrium TGE equals 0.05 times q.
Equilibrium: dE divided by dt equals sum of Q minus sum of W.
Delta u equals Qrs minus Wres with Wres equals p02 times (V2 minus V1).
Qrs equals Delta u plus Wres.
With V2 equals m times R times T2 divided by p2 equals 1.1 times L.
With p02, p01 equals 1.4 bar.
