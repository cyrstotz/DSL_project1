Tv equals four Kelvin above Tsub, which implies Tv equals negative eighteen degrees Celsius. Energy equals three point one kilojoules per kilogram, from state 2 to 3 (stationary, adiabatic). Mass flow rate is calculated as negative work divided by enthalpy difference from 2 to 3, resulting in zero point eight three four kilograms per second. Enthalpy at state 2 is calculated as enthalpy at state 1 at negative sixteen degrees Celsius, resulting in two hundred thirty-seven point seventy-four kilojoules per kilogram. Enthalpy at state 3 is calculated using enthalpy at eight bar, resulting in two hundred seventy-seven point thirty-seven kilojoules per kilogram. Entropy at state 2 equals entropy at state 3, resulting in zero point nine two seven eight kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
