T-S diagram, isobaric units

A graph is drawn with T [K] on the vertical axis and s [kJ/kgK] on the horizontal axis. The graph has points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, with lines connecting them in a loop. The lines between points 1 and 2, and 4 and 5 are labeled 'isobar'. Points 1 to 5 are connected with a dashed line labeled 'isobar'.

2-3: isobaric heat addition  
3-4: adiabatic reversible expansion  
4-5: isobaric cooling  
5-6: reversible adiabatic
