E x sub far equals m dot times (h sub 6 minus h sub 0 minus T sub 0 times (s sub 6 minus s sub 0) plus d x e.

h sub 6 minus h sub 0 equals c sub p times (T sub 6 minus T sub 0) equals 700 times v sub 6 divided by v sub 0 times (340.04 minus 273.15 plus 30 d) equals 57.0 m squared divided by s squared.

T sub 0 times (s sub 6 minus s sub 0) equals T sub 0 times c sub p times ln (T sub 0 divided by T sub 0) equals (273.15 minus 30 d) minus 1.006 times v sub 6 divided by v sub 0 times ln (340.04 divided by (273.15 plus 30 d)) divided by 2 times v sub 6 squared minus v sub 0 squared divided by 2 equals 170 m squared divided by s squared.

E x sub far divided by m dot equals phi times (57 minus 52 plus 170) equals 65 times v sub 6 divided by s squared.
