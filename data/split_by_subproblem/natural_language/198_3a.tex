Pg, Kolben

[Diagram showing a rectangle labeled 'Kolben']

Pg,1 equals Pamb plus Pholben plus Pew

equals 1 bar plus Me times g divided by pi times D divided by 2 squared plus Ml times g divided by pi times D divided by 2 squared

equals 1.05 N divided by m squared plus 0.1 kg times 9.81 m divided by s squared divided by pi times 0.05 m squared plus 32 kg times 9.81 m divided by s squared divided by pi times 5 times 10 to the power of minus 2 m squared

equals 140094.441 N divided by m squared

equals 1.401 bar

Mg equals Pg,1 times Mg times Vg,1 divided by R times Tg,1

equals 1.401 times 10 to the power of 5 N divided by m squared times 50 kg divided by kmol times 3.14 times 10 to the power of 3 m cubed divided by 8.314 kJ divided by kmol times K times 773.15 K

equals 3.422 g
