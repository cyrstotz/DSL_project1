A graph is drawn on a grid. The horizontal axis is labeled 'T (K)' and the vertical axis is labeled 'p'. The graph shows a curve starting from the origin and increasing. 

On the graph, there are several annotations:
- 'Fest' is written near the curve on the left side.
- 'Fl√ºssig' is written near the top right side of the graph.
- 'Tripel' is written near the middle of the graph, close to the curve.
- Two arrows are drawn pointing to the curve labeled 'i' and 'ii'.
- 'a)' is written at the top next to the task label.
