delta e subscript st equals m dot times [h subscript o minus h subscript e minus T subscript o times (s subscript o minus s subscript e) plus delta u subscript e]  
delta e subscript st equals  

h subscript o minus h subscript e equals c subscript p times (T subscript o minus T subscript e) equals minus eighty-five point three six kilojoules divided by kilogram  

s subscript e minus s subscript e equals c subscript p times ln (T subscript o divided by T subscript e) minus R times ln (p subscript o divided by p subscript e) equals minus zero point three minus two hundred eighty-six point five three (cancelled text)  
R equals R divided by M equals eight hundred thirty-four divided by twenty-eight point ninety-seven equals two hundred eighty-six point ninety-nine  

delta u subscript e (two hundred squared minus four hundred eighty-one point six squared divided by two)  

delta e subscript st equals m dot times [minus eighty-five point three six minus two hundred forty-three point twenty-five (minus zero point three) minus delta k subscript e]
