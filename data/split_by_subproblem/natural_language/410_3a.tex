P g1 divided by m g

m g equals P s1 times V g1 divided by R g T g1

m g equals 3.422 grams

P s1 equals p amb plus m k times g divided by parenthesis D 1 squared times pi plus m ew times g divided by D f squared times pi

P s1 equals 1.401 bar

R g equals V divided by m g equals 0.16628 cubic meters per kilogram
