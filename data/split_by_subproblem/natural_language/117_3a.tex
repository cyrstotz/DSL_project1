C sub v equals 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. M sub g equals 50 kilograms per kilomole.

P sub g, 17. m sub g squared.

V sub g, 17. V. T sub g, 17. V.

R sub g equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole equals R sub g divided by M sub g equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

P sub g, 17 equals P sub amb plus M K times g divided by pi times (beta divided by 2) squared equals 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by pi times (0.05 meters) squared equals 1.3997 bar.

m sub g equals P sub g, 17 times V sub 1 divided by R sub g times T sub 1 equals 8,000 divided by 1.3997 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 3.79 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 0.76628 times 50 divided by kilogram Kelvin times (500 plus 273.75) Kelvin equals 0.00341876 kilograms equals 3.41876 grams.
