Two diagrams are drawn:

1. A pressure (p) versus temperature (T) diagram with a curve labeled from point 1 to point 4. The curve is enclosed within two lines, representing different phases.
2. A pressure (p) versus temperature (T) diagram with a rectangular path labeled 1, 2, 3, 4. The path is marked with labels: 'fest' (solid), 'flüssig' (liquid), 'gasförmig' (gaseous), 'Tripel' (triple point), and '5 mbar'.
