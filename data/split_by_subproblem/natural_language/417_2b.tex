b) gas equals CO2 and T6

T7 divided by T5 equals (2.26 divided by P5) to the power of 0.296 divided by h

T6 equals (2 divided by P6) to the power of 0.296 divided by h multiplied by 1.5

equals (P divided by S) divided by 0.5 bar equals 431.5 K

T6 equals 328.075 K

dE divided by dt equals the sum over i of mi multiplied by (h2 minus h1 plus omega squared minus omega1 squared divided by 2) plus the sum over j of qj minus the sum over u of omega dot u

Zero equals the sum of m dot i multiplied by (h2 minus h1 plus omega2 squared minus omega1 squared divided by 2)

Two multiplied by (h2 minus h1) equals omega2 squared minus omega1 squared

Therefore omega2 equals the square root of two multiplied by (h2 minus h1) plus omega1 squared

h2 equals h multiplied by (431.5 K) leading to AZZ

equals h multiplied by (430 K) plus 1.5 multiplied by (h multiplied by (440 K) minus h multiplied by (430 K)) divided by 10

equals 431.43 kilojoules per kilogram minus 1.5 multiplied by 444.6 kilojoules per kilogram minus 431.43 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 10

equals 432.364 kilojoules per kilogram
