w subscript s equals 220 meters per second

T subscript s divided by p subscript s equals 0.5 bar

p subscript 6 equals 0.787 bar

m subscript s equals m subscript 6

x subscript s equals arrow

w subscript s equals p subscript s equals w subscript 6 minus p subscript 6

Arrow p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 6 equals w subscript s plus p subscript s divided by p subscript 6 equals 575.9 meters per second

T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 3 equals (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 3) to the power of n minus 1 divided by n

Arrow T subscript 6 equals T subscript 6 equals T subscript 5 multiplied by (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript s) to the power of n minus 1 divided by n

n equals 1.4

Arrow T subscript 6 equals 431.8 Kelvin multiplied by (0.787 bar divided by 0.5 bar) to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4 equals 328.1 Kelvin
