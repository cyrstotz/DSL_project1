First law of thermodynamics at the nozzle

0 = mass flow rate times (enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at entrance plus (velocity at exit squared minus velocity at entrance squared) divided by 2)  
0 = specific enthalpy at state s minus specific enthalpy at state 6 plus (velocity at state s squared minus velocity at state 6 squared) divided by 2  

Therefore, specific enthalpy at state s minus specific enthalpy at state 6 equals specific heat at constant pressure times (temperature at state s minus temperature at state 6).  

Note: "isentropic nozzle" is written on the side.
