T1,2 equals T equals Ekin. 

T equals Ekin, 2 equals Ekin, 1. 

T1,2 equals O times 2 divided by 2 times 0. 

The temperature is equal because in this case, the energy is conserved and therefore all energy that was stored in the energy spectrum is not lost. 

rho2 equals rho1 equals T1 divided by T2 equals 1.9053 times. 

The pressure does not change because the conservation law must always be valid.
