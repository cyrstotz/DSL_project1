A graph is drawn on a grid, labeled with 'eta' on the y-axis and 'T (Kelvin)' on the x-axis. The graph has a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The region between points 1 and 2 is labeled 'Nass-Dampf'. The section from point 2 to point 3 is labeled 'isobar', and the section from point 3 to point 4 is labeled 'isobar'.
