Equations and calculations are presented as follows:

v mass equals rho times A times w

rho equals one over v

Zero equals m dot mass times (omega e squared minus omega a squared over two) minus W t

W t equals psi integral from one to two of v d p

omega e equals 220 meters per second

omega a equals omega six equals 500 meters per second

T six equals 340 Kelvin
