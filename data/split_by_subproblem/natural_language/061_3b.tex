p times V equals m times R times T therefore T: EW consists of ice and water therefore T_ew equals 0 degrees Celsius  

No heat exchange takes place anymore therefore T_gz equals 0 degrees Celsius equals 273.15 Kelvin  

p_2g equals p_1g since p_amb remains constant and the mass of the weight and the EW remain constant therefore p_g equals 7.407 bar
