Energy balance: A diagram is drawn with points labeled 5 and 6. There is an equation: 0 equals m dot times (h5 minus h6 plus one-half times (w5 squared minus w6 squared)). 
w6 equals the square root of w5 squared minus 2 times (h6 minus h5) equals the square root of w5 squared minus 2 times cp times (T6 minus TS). 
w5 equals 508.6 meters per second.
