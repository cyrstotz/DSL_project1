Given values:
Ws equals 220 meters per second.
P5 equals 0.5 bar.
T5 equals 431.9 Kelvin.
Wg equals ?.
P6 equals 0.191 bar.
T6 equals ?.

An equation is written: "Schadlose adiabatic + reversible => isotrop".

For an ideal gas:
T6 over T45 equals (P6 over P45) to the power of m minus 1 over m, leading to s equals s2 equals 1.4.

The equation continues with:
T6 equals 431.9 multiplied by (0.191 over 0.5) to the power of 1.4 minus 1 over m equals 328.075 Kelvin.

An energy balance equation is given:
0 equals m over m (h2 minus h1 plus (We squared minus Wa squared over 2) plus Q over Cp (T6 minus T5) over (1.006 over 328.075) minus 431.9.

Some flow is noted with the variable Wa, which is underlined. The page ends with "Contd."
