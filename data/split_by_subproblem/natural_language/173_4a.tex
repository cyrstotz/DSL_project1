P one equals one bar, T one equals minus ten degrees Celsius.

A graph is drawn with pressure (p) in bar on the y-axis and temperature (T) in kilojoules on the x-axis. The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled one, two, three, and four. The loop starts at point one, goes to point two, then to point three, and returns to point one.
