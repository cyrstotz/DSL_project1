w subscript 6, T subscript 6  
T subscript 5 equals 431.8 Kelvin, p subscript 5 equals 0.5 bar, p subscript 6 equals 0.491 bar  
w subscript 6 equals 220 meters per second  
s subscript 5 equals s subscript 6  
s subscript 6 minus s subscript 3 equals 0  
(T subscript 6 over T subscript 5) equals (p subscript 6 over p subscript 5) to the power of n minus 1 over n  
T subscript 6 equals T subscript 5 times (p subscript 6 over p subscript 5) to the power of n minus 1 over n equals 431.8 Kelvin times (0.491 over 0.5) to the power of 1.4 minus 1 over 1.4  
T subscript 6 equals 328.075 Kelvin

T sub G2, p sub G12?

Temperature decreases as the thermodynamic equilibrium is reached until T sub G equals T sub EW.

Pressure also decreases as the thermodynamic equilibrium is reached.
