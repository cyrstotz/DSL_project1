T with line KT entropy balance

O with line equals m with dot (s with line ein minus s with line aus) equals Q with line aus divided by T with line plus S with line aus

T with line equals integral T d s divided by s with line a minus s with line e equals Q with line rev divided by s with line aus minus s with line ein

equals two hundred seven point two seven three
equals zero point three (one point three zero six nine minus zero point nine five four nine)
equals five hundred eighty-eight point six three seven five K TAB plus two

integral T d s equals Q with line rev
Q with line rev equals sixty-two point one eight two divided by zero point three
equals two hundred seven point seven seven three
