A graph is shown with a labeled x-axis as 'S [kJ/kg*K]' and a labeled y-axis as 'T [K]'. The graph includes several points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 connected by lines. The lines are labeled with processes: 'isotherm', 'isobar', and 'isotherm'. There is a box with an interpolation formula: 
Y = Y1 + (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1) * (X - X1).

E exothermic equals m dot exothermic times h zero minus h zero minus T zero times s zero minus s zero plus n divided by two times w zero squared minus w zero squared
