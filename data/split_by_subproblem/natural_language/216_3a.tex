pg,1 m, g

SSW: pg,1 = pamb + g times (m, e + m, ew) divided by A
= 740.195 Pa
= 740.115 kPa

IG: m times R times T = p times V
m = p times V divided by R times T
= 0.00392 kg

A divided by 4 times pi times d squared divided by 4 = 0.00785 meters squared

v, g = 0.00374 meters cubed

R = R divided by m = 8.314 divided by 50 = 0.1663 kJ divided by kg times K

T = 500 degrees Celsius = 773.15 K
