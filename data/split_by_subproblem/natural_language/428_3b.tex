The absolute value of s at seventy degrees Celsius equals one point zero four three times ten to the power of three meters cubed per kilogram.

ds over dt equals capital D capital S over time equals Q dot over T plus S dot.

Mean of s at seventy degrees minus s at seventy degrees equals negative sixty-two point nine eight kilowatts over two hundred fifty-three point one five Kelvin plus S sub two.

Therefore, S sub two equals zero point two kilograms per second times mean of one thousand cubic meters per second minus one thousand cubic meters per second plus sixty-two point nine eight kilowatts over two hundred fifty-three point one five Kelvin.

Equals two hundred forty-five point five eight six meters squared per kilogram.
