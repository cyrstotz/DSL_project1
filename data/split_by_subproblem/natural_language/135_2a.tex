A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the vertical axis and entropy (s) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a cycle with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The path between these points is marked with different lines, some of which are labeled "isobare" (isobaric). Specific isobaric lines are labeled with pressures: "isobare p equals 2 bar" from point 1 to 2, "isobare mit 0.5 bar" from point 5 to 6, and "isobare p equals 0.97 bar" at point 6.

Delta exergy equals exergy six minus exergy zero.  
Equals h six minus h zero minus T zero times s six minus s zero plus w six squared divided by two minus w zero squared divided by two.  
Equals c p times T six minus T zero minus T zero times c p times ln T six divided by T zero minus R times ln p six divided by p zero plus w six squared divided by two minus w zero squared divided by two.  

T six equals 328.075 Kelvin  
T zero equals 283.75 Kelvin  
c p equals 1.006  
w six equals 502.2 meters per second  
w zero equals 200 meters per second  

Delta exergy equals 120.8 kilojoules per kilogram
