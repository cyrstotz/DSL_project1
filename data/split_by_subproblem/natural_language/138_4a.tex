Isobar and isotherm of an ideal displacement process.

Assumptions:
- Ideal, reversible displacement
- Q equals zero, W equals zero

Assumptions:
- Isotherm expansion and isobar compression assumed

Diagram:
A graph with axes labeled P and T, showing three curves intersecting at points labeled (a), (b), and (c). The points are connected by lines indicating a process path.

Ti from the graph (intersection with triple point of water):
Ti equals negative 20 degrees Celsius
Tn equals negative 26 degrees Celsius
