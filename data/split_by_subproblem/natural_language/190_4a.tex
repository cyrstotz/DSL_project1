A graph is drawn with axes labeled. The vertical axis is labeled P in brackets with the units in megapascal. The horizontal axis is labeled T in brackets with the units in Kelvin. The graph shows a closed loop with four points numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Arrows indicate the direction of the loop starting from point 1 to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 4.
