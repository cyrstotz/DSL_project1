The equation is written as:
h5 plus ws2 squared over 2 equals h6 plus ws2 squared over 2.

Below, it states:
"DÃ¼se ist isentrop" leading to s3 equals s6, leading to n equals k equals 1.4.

The equation for T6 is:
T6 equals T5 times (p2 over p5) to the power of k minus 1 over k equals 431.9 K times (0.19 over 0.5) to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 equals 328.07 K.

The equation continues:
ws2 squared over 2 equals h5 minus h6 plus ws2 squared over 2.

The specific heat capacity equation is:
equals cp times (T5 minus T6) plus ws2 squared over 2.

The calculated energy is:
equals 104.45 kJ plus 24.2 kJ equals 128.65 kJ.

The velocity equation is:
v6 equals square root of 2 times 128.65 kJ over 1.00 kJ per kg K times (431.9 minus 328.07 K) plus (220 m/s) squared over 2 equals 507.29 m/s.
