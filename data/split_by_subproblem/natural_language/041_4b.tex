The text describes a process from state 2 to state 3, labeled as 'isotrop' and 'adiabar'. The equation is given as:

d over dt equals mi times hi plus the sum of W dot over n.

It is noted that the work is done on the system. 

The equation is further elaborated as:

0 equals m dot R times the quantity h2 minus h3 plus Wk.

The mass flow rate is given as:

m dot R equals Wk over h2 minus h3.

Additional equations and conditions are provided:

h2 equals hg at T2,
T2 equals unknown,
h3 equals hf at 8 bar plus x times the quantity hg at 8 bar minus hf at 8 bar; x equals unknown.

The condition 'isotrop' implies that s2 equals s3, and s2 equals sg at T2.
