A equals pi times r squared. r equals 0.05 meters. A equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.

Pk equals F divided by A. F equals m times g. Therefore, Pk equals 32.9 times g divided by 7.854 times omega squared, which equals approximately 39369.53 pascals, approximately 0.399 bar.

PeW equals m times eW divided by A times 0.9 times g, which equals 0.1 times 0.9 times g divided by 7.854 times omega squared, which equals approximately 124.90 pascals, approximately 1.249 times omega squared bar.

PgW equals Pk plus PeW plus Pbomb equals 1.14 bar.

Pg times Vg divided by omega equals m times g times R times T divided by M.

mg equals Pg times Vg times 1 divided by R times T equals 1.1 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 3.14 times omega squared meters cubed divided by 50 kilograms divided by mole divided by 8.314 divided by (500 plus 273.15).

mg equals 0.818 grams.
