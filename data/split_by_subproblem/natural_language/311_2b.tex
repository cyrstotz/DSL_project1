Schneidüse adiab reversibel
Arrow pointing right: s5 equals s6 isentropic
Equation: T6 divided by T5 equals (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of k minus one divided by k
Equation: T6 equals T5 times (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of k minus one divided by k equals 328.075 Kelvin (underlined)
Arrow pointing right: 1HS von an der Subdüse
Equation: Q equals m dot 2 times (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared divided by two minus w6 squared divided by two)
Equation: w6 squared divided by two equals h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared divided by two
Equation: h5 minus h6 equals 4 times cp Luft times (T5 minus T6) equals 103.888 w5 divided by kg
Equation: w6 equals the square root of 2 times (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared divided by two) equals 506.14 meters per second
