Note that the thermodynamic system is directly proportional to the entropy balance with T:

S dot equals m dot in times s in plus m dot out times s out plus Q out dot over T plus S irrev equals zero for the stationary system.

Therefore:

Q out dot over T plus m dot in times S in minus S out equals minus S irrev.
