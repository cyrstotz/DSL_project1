P sub v 1

P V equals R T

minus m sub kg minus P sub umben plus P sub v 1 A sub kolben equals zero

A sub kolben equals pi times (0.21 divided by 2) squared equals 7.85 times 10 to the power of minus 3 meters squared (value stored in calculator)

P sub v 1 equals P sub umben plus m sub kg g divided by A sub kolben equals 1.05 newtons per meter squared plus 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 7.85 times 10 to the power of minus 3 meters squared equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 pascal equals 1.4 bar

m sub kg: P V equals R T m

m equals P V divided by R T

R equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole kelvin divided by 50 kilojoules per kilomole equals 0.166 kilojoules per kilogram kelvin

m equals 1.9 bar times 3.141 times 10 to the power of 2 divided by 0.166 kilojoules per kilogram kelvin times 773.15 kelvin equals 3.66 grams
