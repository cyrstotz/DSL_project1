A graph is shown with temperature T in Kelvin on the vertical axis and entropy S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The graph is labeled with points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There is a curve labeled 'P = const'. The points are connected with lines forming a cycle. The positions of points are approximately marked on the graph.

Below the graph, there is a sequence of numbers and symbols:
- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- P = 0.191
- T = -30
