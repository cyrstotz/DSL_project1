Thermodynamic efficiency of the system, open, stationary, assuming only work on a fluid liquid:

h in equals 288.45 kilojoules per kilogram, h out equals 298.15 kilojoules per kilogram, P one equals P two.

T equals integral from T one to T two of c over T dT.

Assuming C is constant, therefore:

S of T one minus S of T two equals C times ln of T two over T one.

A minimum quality as Q min equals:

T equals (298.15 minus 288.45) divided by ln of (298.15 over 288.15) approximately equals 293.12 Kelvin.
