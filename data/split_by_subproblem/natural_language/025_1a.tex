Graphical representation of the reaction enthalpy

Region 1

P V T h

70 degrees Celsius 100 degrees Celsius 400 degrees Celsius

The diagram shows a graph with an x-axis labeled as T in degrees Celsius and a y-axis labeled as S in kilograms per kilogram. The graph includes several curves and points labeled as follows:

- Point 0 is labeled as 'solubility curve (saturated)'.
- Point 1 is labeled as 'solubility curve (saturated)'.
- Point 2 is labeled as 'solubility curve (saturated)'.
- Point 3 is labeled as 'solubility curve (unsaturated)'.
- Point 4 is labeled as 'solubility curve (unsaturated)'.
- Point 5 is labeled as 'solubility curve (unsaturated)'.
- Point 6 is labeled as 'solubility curve (unsaturated)'.

b) R is greater than or equal to zero

When the temperature outside is higher than the temperature inside, heat exchange occurs from outside to inside. This is the opposite when the temperature is lower inside.

c) Tew equals Tew2 equals Tew3 equals Tew4 equals Tew5 equals Tew6 equals Tew7 equals Tew8

d) Tew7 equals 19.2
