Pressure in gas: m sub ew g plus p sub ew A.  
Pressure sub gas equals m sub ew g plus p sub ew A.  
A equals m sub ew g divided by p sub ew equals 1.4009 bar.  
Pressure equals p V divided by R T.  
m sub g equals p V divided by R T equals 3.4217 g.  
a) The pressure in the gas remains constant since the same weight still presses. Pressure sub gas equals Pressure sub gas equals 1.4009 bar.  
T sub gz equals T sub ew2 equals G G W.  
b) Ice is present in the two-phase area and since the water is at a constant temperature, the pressure does not change, otherwise the temperature also changes. Since we are at 0 degrees Celsius, T sub gz equals T sub ew2 equals G G W are also O C.
