Energy balance around the throttle
Dose = Throttle no work

Zero = m in gas (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared minus w6 squared over two equals zero) equals zero equals zero equals zero equals one over m gas (Delta RE plus Q k60 minus W k2) implies h6 minus h5 equals w6 squared minus w5 squared over two

Isentropic Adiabatic Reversal
m equals k plus l plus l

T theta over T 5 equals (w2 over w1) (P0 over P5) to the power of m minus 1 over m implies T 6 equals T 5 times (P0 over P5) to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 equals 431.8 times (0.94 over 0.5) to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 equals 328.1K

h6 minus h5 ideal gas equals c p right (T 6 minus T 5) equals 1.006 (w2 over w1) (s k2 k1 x) times (328.1K minus 431.8K)

(h6 minus h5) equals w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by two.
