Mass flow rate of R134a: ?  
State (2-3): isentropic because it is reversible and adiabatic  

Mass flow rate of R134a times (h sub e minus h sub a) plus the sum of heat flow rates minus the sum of work rates equals zero.  
The process is mechanical.  
Energy balance at the throttle (isentropic).  

Mass flow rate (0) equals 0.  
Energy balance at the compressor  
Mass flow rate times (h sub 2 minus h sub 3) equals 28 watts.
