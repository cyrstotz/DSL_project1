System around the wall:

Zero equals Q aus over T reactor minus Q aus over T k f plus S e r z.

Therefore, S e r z equals Q aus over T k f minus Q aus over T reactor.

Equals six hundred sixty-five kilowatts over two hundred ninety-three point one Kelvin minus sixty-five kilowatts over two hundred seventy-three point zero five Kelvin approximately equals negative sixteen point two one kilowatts per Kelvin.

(T reactor equals one hundred degrees Celsius equals three hundred seventy-three point one five Kelvin).
