A graph is depicted with axes labeled T (temperature) and Ds (entropy). The graph shows a process with points labeled 1 through 6, connected by curves. The segments between points are labeled as follows: between 1 and 2, labeled "isentrop"; between 2 and 3, labeled "isobar"; between 3 and 4, labeled "isobar (0.5 bar)"; between 4 and 5, labeled "isobar (0.1 bar)"; and between 5 and 6, labeled "isobar".
