Q equals m times [he minus ha plus we squared minus wa squared divided by two] minus Wt.rev.

he minus ha equals Cp times (Tb minus Ta) equals 104.448 kilojoules per kilogram.

Tc equals (P0 divided by P5) raised to the power k minus one times Tb equals 325.0746969 Kelvin.

k equals 1.4.

Wdot plus Wrev plus Wa equals m times R times (T8 minus T5) divided by one minus n equals 74.608 kilojoules per kilogram.

R equals Cp minus Cv equals 0.297975471.

Cv equals Cf divided by k equals 0.718479 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Q equals he minus ha plus we squared divided by two minus wa squared divided by two minus Wrev.

wa times [he minus ha plus we squared divided by two minus Wrev] times two equals 220.13559 meters per second squared.
