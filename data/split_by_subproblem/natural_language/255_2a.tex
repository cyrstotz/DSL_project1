A graph is drawn with an axis labeled "T" and another axis labeled "S" with units "kJ/kgK". The graph features a curved line that peaks and descends, resembling a bell shape.

2.45 Half open system:

Delta S one two equals delta m two prime S zero plus Q R over T plus S prime m

Stationary flow process

P ex, ver = delta ex, ist + delta ex, iq - w t = 0, da gesamte Leistung der Turbine in Verdichter geht!

o ex, iq = (1 - T 0 over T B) q B = 969.58 kilojoules per kilogram

e x, ver = 1710.38 kilojoules per kilogram
