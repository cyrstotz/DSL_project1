w6: reversible and adiabatic nozzle:

Energy balance around the nozzle:
0 equals ṁ (he minus ha plus we squared minus wa squared divided by 2) I

Entropy balance:
0 equals ṁ (se minus sa) implies Se equals Sa

For the polytropic state equation:
T6 equals Ts (P6 divided by Ps) to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n)

328.07 K equals T6

I: 2 times (h6 minus h5) equals w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2

Specific heat:
Cp times (T6 minus Ts)

w6 squared equals we squared minus 2 times (h6 minus h5)

w6 equals 507.24 m squared divided by s squared equals kg

There are additional notes:
- 101.44 KJ divided by kg
- J divided by kg equals 1000
- equals 1000 m squared divided by s squared
