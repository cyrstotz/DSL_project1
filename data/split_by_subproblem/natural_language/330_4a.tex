The page contains two diagrams.

1. The first diagram is a graph with a y-axis labeled "p" in brackets and a x-axis labeled "T" in degrees Kelvin. The graph shows a curve with the following labels:
   - "unterkühlte Flüssigkeit" on the left side of the curve.
   - "Nassdampf" under the curve.
   - "überhitzter Dampf" on the right side of the curve.
   - Points labeled "2" and "1" are indicated with vertical lines on the curve.

2. The second diagram is another graph with the y-axis labeled "p" in brackets and the x-axis labeled "T" in degrees Celsius. The graph shows a bell-shaped curve with:
   - A label "pT" and "pT=6bar" on the y-axis.
   - Points labeled "2" and "1" at the top of the curve.
   - The x-axis has points labeled "Tic" and "Ti" beneath the curve.
