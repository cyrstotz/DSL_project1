p zero equals p one. Adiabatic reversible compression. T four equals T five times (p zero over p five) to the power of n minus one over n. T four equals 328.07 Kelvin. n equals x equals 1.4. p four equals 15000. p five equals 50000. 

Zero equals h e minus h a plus w e squared minus w a squared over 2. C equals C p times (T e minus T a) plus w e squared minus w a squared over 2. w e equals 507.23 meters squared per second squared. Adiabatic does not perform any work.
