p one equals two, m one equals two

p two equals p one plus m one times F over A equals p one plus m a over A

A equals pi times D squared over four equals zero point zero zero three seven five square meters

m g equals (m one plus m two) times g equals thirty-two point seven kilograms times g equals three hundred and twenty-one point six zero one newtons

m g over A equals zero point four bar

p over V equals m R T, p equals p one, V equals three point one four times ten to the power of negative three cubic meters, T equals two hundred and ninety-three point one five Kelvin

m g equals p V over R T equals R over M equals one hundred and sixty-six point two eight joules per kilogram Kelvin

m g equals p V over R T equals thirty-four point two grams
