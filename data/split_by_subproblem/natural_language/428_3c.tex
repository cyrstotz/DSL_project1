The absolute value of s at fifty degrees liquid equals zero point eight five kilograms per Kelvin.

s at seventy degrees liquid equals one point three zero six kilograms per Kelvin.

ds over dt equals mean of s at fifty degrees liquid minus s at seventy degrees liquid equals Q dot over T plus S dot.

Therefore, zero point one kilograms per second times zero point eight five kilograms per Kelvin minus one point three zero six kilograms per Kelvin plus one hundred sixty-two point one eight two kilowatts over two hundred fifty-three point one five Kelvin equals S sub two.

Therefore, S sub two equals zero point one six zero five kilograms per Kelvin.
