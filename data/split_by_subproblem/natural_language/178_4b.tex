The equation R equals R with subscript 1 plus 2 is written. Below, the equation x subscript t equals 1 is noted, followed by h. An expression shows the derivative with respect to time of an unspecified quantity crossed out, equals m dot in brackets h subscript 3 minus h subscript 2, minus V dot subscript k plus Q dot subscript o. Another equation shows V dot subscript k equals m in brackets h subscript 1 minus h subscript 2. Finally, the equation S subscript 2 equals S subscript 3 is written.
