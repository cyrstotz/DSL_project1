Delta e x,str equals e x,str,c minus e x,str,o equals h6 minus ha minus T0 times (s6a minus s6o) plus one-half times (w6 squared minus w6 squared) equals cp times (T6 minus T0) minus T0 times (cp times ln(Tc divided by T0) minus R times ln(p6 divided by p0) squared) plus one-half times (w6 squared minus w6 squared) equals 120.32 kilojoules per kilogram.
