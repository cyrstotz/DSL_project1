omega squared sub l minus omega squared sub c equals two times (h sub G minus h sub S)

zero equals m times g times (h sub S minus h sub G) plus m times g times (omega squared sub J minus omega squared sub c divided by two) times x times (x sub 0 minus x sub c)

omega squared sub c equals two times (h sub S minus h sub G) plus omega squared sub S

equals square root of two times C sub p times (T sub S minus T sub G) plus omega squared sub S

i s o e n equals T divided by V equals k u l l
