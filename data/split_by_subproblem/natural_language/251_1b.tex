S i minus S e equals q rev over h e minus h a over S a minus S e equals 359.13 Kelvin
S a equals S f (70 degrees Celsius) equals 0.9598 kilojoules per kilogram
S e equals S f (100 degrees Celsius) equals 1.3068 kilojoules per kilogram T A13 A2

A table is drawn with columns labeled "vollst. Verd." (1), "ges." (2), and "s. voll." (3), and "a". The rows are labeled "T [째C]", "p [bar]", "s [kJ/kg]", and "h [kJ/kg]". The entries under "T [째C]" are crossed out in column 1, "41째C" in column 2, "37.1째C" in column 3, and "31.33" in column "a". The entries under "p [bar]" are "3.3765" in column 1, "3.3755" in column 2, "8" in column 3, and "8" in column "a". The entries under "s [kJ/kg]" are crossed out in column 1, "0.5165" in column 2, and crossed out in column 3. The entries under "h [kJ/kg]" are crossed out in column 1, "0.5165" in column 2, and crossed out in column 3.
