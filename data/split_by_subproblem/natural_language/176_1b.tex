T bar equals integral from s e to s a T ds divided by s a minus s e equals h a minus h e divided by s a minus s e equals Q aus divided by m u F divided by s a minus s e equals six point three three watts per Kelvin times c i f divided by c i f times ln of T a o divided by T a n. Arrow to ten Kelvin divided by ln of two hundred eighty eight point one five Kelvin divided by two hundred eighty five point one Kelvin equals two hundred ninety three point one two Kelvin.
