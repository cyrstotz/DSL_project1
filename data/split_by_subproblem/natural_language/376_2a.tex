The diagram is a graph with an x-axis labeled 's' with units '[kJ/kg K]' and a y-axis labeled 'T' with units '[K]'. Several curves and lines are drawn on the graph, with points labeled 1 through 5. 

- There are two curves marked as 'isentrop' with points labeled 'K' and 'M' along them.
- A line labeled 'P1' is drawn with a vertical arrow pointing upwards.
- The curve on the right is labeled '0.5 bar' and another curve is labeled '0.1 bar'.
- Points are connected by lines indicating a process path, with arrows showing the direction of the process.
- Points are marked on the graph: point 1 is at the top of the 'P1' line, point 2 is on the left side curve, point 3 is at the peak of the graph, point 4 is on the right side curve, and point 5 is in the center of the graph.
