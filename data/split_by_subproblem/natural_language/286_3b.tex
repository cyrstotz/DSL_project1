Cv equals 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram, T2 equals 0 degrees Celsius equals 273.15 Kelvin.  
The temperature of the water does not change until all the ice is melted (Assume X ice greater than 20).  
Delta E equals 0.633 times 3 grams per gram times 500 Kelvin times 3.429.  
Delta E equals 10.002.413 equals
