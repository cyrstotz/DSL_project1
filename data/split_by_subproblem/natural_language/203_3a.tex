R equals R over u equals eight point three seven four kilojoules per kilogram per mole over fifty kilojoules per mole equals zero point one six six three kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.

P zero, diagram of forces and areas, A equals radius squared times pi equals diameter over two squared times pi equals diameter over two squared times pi equals zero point zero zero seven eight five square meters.

P zero one equals P zero plus Z over A times m k plus m E W equals one bar plus nine point eight one meters per second squared over zero point zero zero seven eight five square meters times thirty-two kilograms plus zero point seven kilograms equals one point four zero one bar.

p V equals m R T, V zero equals zero point zero zero three seven four cubic meters, T zero one equals seven seven three point one five Kelvin.

m zero squared equals pressure over R T zero one equals two point four zero seven bars times zero point zero zero three seven four cubic meters over zero point one six six three kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin times seven seven three point one five Kelvin equals three point four two seven five times ten to the power of three kilograms.
