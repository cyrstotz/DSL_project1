A diagram shows a membrane with arrows indicating pressure P zero and mass m ew. Equations are written as follows: m k g plus P zero A t plus m ew g equals P zero r A. The equation continues with g divided by A times m k plus m ew plus P zero equals P zero g. Another equation is 3.8 divided by square root of 5 omega divided by pi squared times T equals 32 kilograms plus 0.1 kilograms plus delta bar equals 1.9 bar equals P zero r. 

Below the diagram, there are calculations: P zero r V g equals M divided by M zero g times 1 divided by M equals 50 kilograms divided by kilogram mole. A calculation shows W G equals P zero r V G divided by T zero g equals R divided by M zero g equals 1.9 bar times 3.14 times 10 to the power of 5 divided by 773 Kelvin times 8.314 meters cubed kilogram mole Kelvin equals 50 kilograms divided by kilogram mole. The result is 3.42 kilograms equals W G.
