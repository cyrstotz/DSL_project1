P gas equals m g times z.  
P gas equals 1 bar plus 37.4 kilograms per second times 9.81 meters per second squared times 1 divided by 1254.05 Pascal equals 1.1 bar.

m g times V g1 divided by R T g1 equals 0.003 kilograms.  
R2 divided by M g equals 0.4 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
Equals 3.42 grams.
