delta e x sub str sub G equals (h sub G minus h sub 0 minus T sub G times (S sub G minus S sub 0) plus omega squared sub c divided by two)

e x sub str sub 0 equals

ideal gas: e x sub G equals (C sub p times (T sub G minus T sub 0) minus T sub 0 times C sub p times (T sub G divided by T sub 0) plus R times ln (P sub G divided by P sub c))

e x sub str sub c equals h sub 1 minus h sub 0 minus T sub 0 times (S sub 0 minus S sub 0) plus omega squared sub z divided by two equals omega sub u times f times t squared divided by two equals
