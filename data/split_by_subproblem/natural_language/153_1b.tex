T underscore i equals integral from Se underscore in to Se underscore aus T d s divided by Se underscore aus minus Se underscore in equals

d h equals T d s plus V d p (da sich drucke nicht Ã¤ndert)

integral d h equals integral T d s

T underscore i equals o h divided by Se underscore aus minus Se underscore in (subscript KF) equals c underscore p (subscript KF) times ln (T underscore aus minus T underscore ein) (subscript KF) equals c underscore p (subscript KF) times ln (T underscore aus divided by T underscore ein) (subscript KF) divided by ln (T underscore aus divided by T underscore ein) (subscript KF) equals 2.03,42

O S one two equals m two s two minus m one s one equals Q m one two s one two plus Q aus divided by T k f. s one two (T equals twenty degrees Celsius, x equals o) equals zero point two nine six six kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. Delta S one two equals three hundred sixty kilogram zero point two nine six six times ten to the power of three joules per kilogram Kelvin plus thirty-five times ten to the power of six joules divided by two hundred ninety-five Kelvin equals one thousand seven hundred eighty-six four hundred ninety point zero six eight joules per kilogram Kelvin.
