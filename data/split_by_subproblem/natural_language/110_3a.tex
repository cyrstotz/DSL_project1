pg equals question mark
mg equals question mark

A equals pi times r squared equals pi times (d divided by 2) squared equals pi times (0.111 divided by 2) squared equals 0.00785 meters squared

Diagram: A horizontal line labeled "po" with arrows pointing down labeled "mkg" and "mg" on the left, and "mewg" on the right. A vertical line labeled "D equals 10 cm".

Equation: po times A plus mkg times g plus mewg times j divided by po times A plus mkg plus mewg divided by 4 equals pg

Equation: equals pg equals 1.405 newtons per meter squared times 0.00785 meters squared plus 326 kg times 9.81 meters per second squared plus 0.4 kg times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 0.00785 meters squared

pg equals 128853.00737a

pg equals 1.2885 bar

mg equals question mark

Equation: pV equals mRT

Equation: R equals R divided by mg equals 8.314 joules per mole Kelvin divided by 50 Kelvin equals 0.16628 joules per gram Kelvin

Equation: mg equals pV divided by R times Tg1 equals 1.2885 times 10 to the power of 2 kilograms per meter squared times 0.00341 meters cubed divided by 0.16628 joules per gram Kelvin times (500 plus 273.15) equals 0.0034903 kilograms

vg equals 3.14 L minus 0.00341 meters cubed

mg equals 3.14914 g
