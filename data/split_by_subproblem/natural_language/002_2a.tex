Diagram with labeled points:  
- Vertical axis labeled as [K]  
- Horizontal axis labeled as [kJ per kg K]  
- Points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8  
- Line segments connecting points with annotations such as '220' and 'cf equals 0'  
- Horizontal lines labeled pZ equals p3 and p6 equals p0

O equals [h subscript f minus h subscript c plus w subscript n squared divided by z minus w subscript c squared divided by z] plus O superscript zero

z w subscript c squared equals z times (h subscript f minus h subscript c) plus w subscript r squared

2 divided by c subscript p superscript is times (T subscript f minus T subscript c) plus u subscript n squared

w subscript c equals square root of 2 times 1.006 times (83) gram kelvin minus 32 gram kelvin times 0.74 plus 220 squared divided by h subscript S
