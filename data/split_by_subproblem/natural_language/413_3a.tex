Consider: rho subscript small, m g

rho U equals m R T

T equals 500 degrees Celsius, U equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 meters cubed

R equals fraction 33.14 divided by 50 J divided by kg Kelvin

rho equals

Pn equals P0 plus fraction m g divided by A plus fraction 0.1 m g divided by A, hoch Eiswasser, A equals pi times (6.05) squared meters squared

Pn equals 1.15 bar

m equals fraction P V divided by R T equals 0.0035 kg equals approximately 3.5 g
