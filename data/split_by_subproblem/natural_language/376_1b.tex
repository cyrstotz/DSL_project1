Q implies U

The integral from T sub A to T sub Z of c times t d tau over c times t times the integral from n to T d tau equals the integral from T sub A to T sub Z of c times t d tau over c times t times the integral from n to T d tau.

T sub M K equals T sub Z minus T sub n over the natural logarithm of T sub Z over T sub A equals 293.12 K.
