An equation is written with some parts crossed out. The visible part is: Dexistr equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 bracket S0 minus S6 bracket plus u squared 6 over 2 minus u squared 0 over 2. Another equation is written: h6 minus h0 equals CP LUFT bracket T6 minus T0 bracket equals. Below this, calculations are shown: 1.006 bracket 340 minus 233.15 bracket equals 97.43 kJ per kg. Another equation is shown: Sc minus S0 equals CP LUFT ln bracket TC over T0 bracket minus k ln bracket PE over P0 bracket equals 1.006 ln bracket 340 over 233.15 bracket equals 0.3373 kJ per kg.
