The diagram is a phase diagram with pressure labeled as "p [bar]" on the vertical axis and temperature labeled as "T [K]" on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows three regions labeled "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous). The diagram includes a curve with a point labeled "Tripel" (triple point) where the three phases meet. There are arrows indicating transitions between phases.

E subscript k equals the absolute value of Q dot subscript a b divided by the absolute value of W dot subscript e l equals negative Q dot subscript a b divided by negative W dot subscript k.
