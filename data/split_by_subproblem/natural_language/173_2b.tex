The equation dE over dt equals the sum of m times (h plus ke plus pe) plus the sum of Q minus W is written. Below, another equation is written: 0 equals m times (he minus ha plus we squared over 2 minus wa squared over 2). Then, (he plus we squared over 2) equals (ha plus wa squared over 2). The equation we equals the square root of 2 times (he minus ha plus w inlet squared over 2) is written. 

Below, he is noted as Tab A-22. A list of values is given:
- x inlet equals 240 Kelvin
- x1 equals 243.15 Kelvin
- x2 equals 250 Kelvin

Another list is given:
- y inlet equals 210.02
- y1 equals 2
- y2 equals 250.05

Then, the equation y equals (x minus x1) over (x2 minus x1) times (y2 minus y1) plus y1 equals 243.77945 equals he in kilojoules per kilogram.
