Delta U equals Q minus W, where W equals zero, because it is isochoric.

U times (U two minus U one) equals Q.

U two equals zero.

Delta Q over m equals Delta U times (0.003) plus x two times (Phi two minus Phi one) equals Delta m times U one.

Delta Q over m equals minus 200.1 minus U one times (0.003) minus x two times (Phi one minus U one).

Delta Q over m equals minus 200.1 minus U one times (0.003) over minus (U two minus U one times (0.003)).

Therefore, x two equals U one times (0.003) equals minus 0.033.

U two times (0.003) equals minus 353.46427.

Therefore, x two equals 0.5696.

Therefore, x two equals 56.96 percent.

Ek equals Qzu divided by Wk

Qzu equals Qk

=> [diagram] (a vertical rectangle labeled '1' at the top and '2' at the bottom with 'Qk' pointing to the side)

=> 0 equals m dot (h1 minus h2) plus Qk

Qk equals m dot (h2 minus h1) equals

h1 equals h1 plus 35.66% (hg minus h1) equals 93.42 times 42 divided by j

h2 equals 23 times 1.62 times 42 divided by j equals 0.054 times 42 divided by 5 equals 88.91 W

=> Ek equals Qzu divided by Wk equals 91 W divided by 28 W equals 3.25
