Average temperature minus 293 Kelvin divided by heat output equals 65 kilowatts.

Diagram shows heat output and heat input with wall, temperature equals 57.3 Kelvin.

Zero equals heat output divided by temperature out minus heat input divided by average temperature plus entropy generation.

Entropy generation equals heat output divided by average temperature minus heat input divided by temperature out equals 46.146 kilojoules.
