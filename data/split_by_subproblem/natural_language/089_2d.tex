Exergy external equals T zero times s external divided by m dot, everything in the brackets.

Entropy balance around turbine: everything in brackets.

Zero equals m dot bracket s zero minus s six bracket plus Q zero c divided by T zero c plus s external.

Everything adiabatic except combustion chamber.

Q zero c divided by m dot equals negative q B equals negative one point one nine five kilojoules per kilogram.

T zero B equals T B equals one thousand two hundred eighty-nine Kelvin.

s external divided by m dot equals s six minus s zero minus q B divided by T B equals one point three zero four kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Exergy external equals three hundred seventeen point one five kilojoules per kilogram.
