P three one equals P amb plus E divided by A

equals P amb plus eight megajoules divided by A

equals one bar plus three times 9.81 meters per second squared times (0.37 squared) times pi times one meter squared equals one bar plus 359868.5 pascals

approximately equals 1.4 bar.

Consider air in the cylinder chamber as a perfect gas with M S equals 10 kilograms per kilomole.

R equals R bar divided by M equals 8.314 joules per mole kelvin divided by 10 kilograms per kilomole equals 0.8314 joules per kilogram kelvin

equals a

M equals p times V divided by p times T equals 3.14 liters times 1.4 bar divided by 166.38 joules per kilogram kelvin times 775.15 kelvin equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of 8.
