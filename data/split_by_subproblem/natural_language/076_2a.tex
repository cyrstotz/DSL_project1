A graph is shown with the y-axis labeled as T (K) and the x-axis labeled as s (J/kg·K). The graph consists of several points connected by lines. The points are labeled as follows:
- Point 1 to Point 2 is labeled as isobar.
- Point 2 to Point 3 is labeled as isochor.
- Point 3 to Point 4/5 is labeled as isobar.
- Point 4/5 to Point 6 is labeled as isochor.
- Point 6 to Point 1 is labeled as adiabatic.

Additionally, the following annotations are present:
- ρ2 = ρ3
- ρ1 = ρ4 = ρ5 = 0.5 bar
- ρ6 = ρc = 0.193 bar
