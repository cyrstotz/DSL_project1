s_m n2. m2 n2 minus m1 n1 equals delta n12 (h_m) plus Q dot_m n2. m2 equals (m1 plus delta m n1).

e sub k equals q sub z divided by w sub k equals five point eight three seven three  

v sub k equals negative two eight four V  

q sub z equals m dot times h sub two minus h sub n equals seven six two point three seven V equals q sub 2m  

m dot equals zero point zero zero one seven zero kilograms per second  

h sub n equals h sub f plus x times h sub g minus h sub f equals eight six point two zero three kilojoules per kilogram  

h sub f equals two one point seven nine kilojoules per kilogram  

h sub g equals two three four point zero eight kilojoules per kilogram  

h sub 2 equals two three four point zero eight kilojoules per kilogram
