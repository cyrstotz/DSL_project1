T KF equals integral from S one to S two of T dS divided by S one minus S two. p equals constant. Ideal fluid. Equals h one minus h two divided by S one minus S two equals integral from T one to T two of (T A minus T two) divided by integral of (ln of T one divided by T two) equals negative ten Kelvin divided by ln of (two hundred ninety-three point one five Kelvin divided by two hundred ninety-two point one five Kelvin) equals two hundred ninety-three point one five Kelvin.
