Delta exstr equals m ges times in brackets h6 minus h0 minus T0 in brackets s6 minus s0 close brackets subscript k. h6 minus h0 equals cp times in brackets T6 minus T0 equals 97.431 kJ divided by kg K. T6 equals 340 K. T0 equals minus 30 degrees Celsius equals 243.15 K. s6 minus s0 equals cp times ln in brackets T6 divided by Td close brackets minus R ln in brackets p6 divided by p0 close brackets subscript o equals 0.3373 kJ divided by kg K. Delta exstr equals.

The phrase `geh√∂rt zusammen` is written, followed by a calculation:

T6 divided by T5 equals V6 divided by V5 to the power of n minus 1. V5 equals V6 equals. p6 V6 equals R T6. V0 equals R T6 divided by p6 equals 4.93 m cubed divided by kg. m0 equals 1 divided by V6 A6 W6. m0 V6 divided by A6 equals minus W6.
