Q out = ?

Cooling (liquid) = ideal liquid

Zero = m dot (h e minus h a) plus Q dot j minus W dot t in equals zero, constant pressure

Q out = m dot (h a minus h e)

h a minus h e = c p g (T a minus T e)
=

Energy balance reactor:

Zero = m dot (h e minus h a) plus Q dot j minus W dot t in equals zero

Side note: wet steam is present

Sum of Q dot j equals 100 kilowatts minus Q out

Q out = m dot (h e minus h a) plus 100 kilowatts

h e = ?

Table A-1:

h f = 259.98 kilojoules per kilogram

h g = 2626.8 kilojoules per kilogram

A graph is drawn with axes labeled 'P' (pressure) and 'T' (temperature). The graph shows a curve with points labeled '1', '2', and '3'. The point '1' is marked as 'Flüssig' (liquid), point '2' is marked 'isobar', and point '3' is marked 'isotherm'. There is a notation 'fest' (solid) near point '2'. The point 'T' is labeled 'Tripel' (triple). The area above the curve is labeled 'Gas' (gas), and below the curve is labeled 'Flüssig' (liquid) and 'Gas' (gas).
