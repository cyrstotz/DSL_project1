T KF equals integral from T two to T one of dQ out over s two minus s one equals Q out over s two minus s one equals u two minus u one over s two minus s one equals integral from T two to T e of dQ out over T e times ln of T two over T e equals (293.15 K minus 292.15 K) over ln of (293.15 K over 293.15 K).

T equals 293.122 K.
