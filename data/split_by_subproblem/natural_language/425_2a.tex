A graph is drawn with temperature T in Kelvin on the vertical axis and entropy S in cubic meters per kilogram Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The graph features a cycle labeled with points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The points are connected by lines, with segments labeled as follows: the segment from 1 to 2 is labeled "isobar," the segment from 2 to 3 is labeled "P3 = P2," and the segment from 3 to 4 is labeled "P1 = P4 = P5." The segment from 4 to 5 is labeled "isotrop," and the segment from 5 to 6 is labeled "P5 = P6." There is shading between points 2 and 3.
