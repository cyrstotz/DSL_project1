The page contains two graphs.

The first graph is labeled with "T [K]" on the vertical axis and "S [kJ/kg K]" on the horizontal axis. It shows several intersecting curves, with one prominent curve resembling an inverted parabola.

The second graph also features "T [K]" on the vertical axis and "S [kJ/kg K]" on the horizontal axis. This graph includes a series of numbered points from 0 to 6 connected by lines. There are annotations: "s = const" and "s â‰  const" with arrows pointing to specific sections of the graph. The label "Po" is written near the upper right side of the graph.

Below the second graph, there is a handwritten note: "Zustand 4 liegt nicht per se auf der ps Isobare."
