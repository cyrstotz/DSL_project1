T0 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n

T0 equals T5 (p0 divided by p5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n equals 328.1 K equals A

0 = m dot (h c minus h a plus u c squared minus u v squared divided by 2 plus p c minus p v) minus W dot

w v squared divided by 2 equals h a minus h c plus w v squared divided by 2 minus W rev56

W v u6 equals 2 (h5 minus h c) plus w v5 squared minus 2 W rev56

h5 minus h c equals c p (T5 minus T6), W rev56 equals R (T6 minus T5) divided by 1 minus n

v c equals 2 c p (T5 minus T6) plus v v5 squared minus 2 R (T6 minus T5) divided by 1 minus n

v c equals 329.11 m squared divided by s equals C

R equals R divided by m Luft equals 28.69 equals B (Lambda) squared
