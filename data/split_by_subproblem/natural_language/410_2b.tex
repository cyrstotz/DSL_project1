w_e / T_6:
S_5 = S_6

Delta S equals the integral from T_5 to T_c of C_p^is(T) divided by T dT minus R ln(P_o divided by P_7).

Delta S equals C_p^is times (ln(T_c divided by T_5) minus R ln(P_o divided by P_7)).

T_c divided by T_3 equals (P_o divided by P_5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n implies T_6 equals T_5 times (P_o divided by P_5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n equals 328.07 K.

O equals m dot times (h_5 minus h_o plus w_5 squared divided by 2 minus w_o squared divided by 2) plus Q dot minus sum of w dot_in.

O equals h_5 minus h_o plus w_5 squared minus w_o squared divided by 2 minus w dot.

w_b equals 2 times (h_5 minus h_o minus w dot plus w_5 squared divided by 2).
