A table is present with columns labeled Z, p [bar], T [K], h, and S. The rows are numbered 1 to 6. For row 5, p is 0.5 and T is 431.9. For row 6, p is 0.191 and T is 328.075.

A graph is labeled with T [K] on the y-axis and S [kJ/kg K] on the x-axis. The graph has points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with lines connecting these points. There are sections labeled isobar and isotherm.
