The equation m dot times h four minus h one equals m dot times h four minus h one plus Q dot a k minus W dot a k adiabatic.  
h a equals h four.  
h four equals h s of eight bar equals two hundred sixty-four point one five kilojoules per kilogram.  
p four equals p three.  
h a equals h f plus x a times h g minus h f and p one.  
h one minus h f divided by h g minus h f equals x a times p a one.
