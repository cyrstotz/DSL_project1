psi equals psi f plus x two times (psi g minus psi f)

u two equals u two f plus x two times (u two g minus u two f)

x two equals u two minus u two f divided by u two g minus u two f

x two equals negative 3047.033 minus negative 0.045 divided by negative 333.458 minus negative 0.045

equals 0.913

T E W two equals 0.00 degrees

u g equals u fest.

m two w (u two minus u one) equals Q m two

u one equals u one f plus x one times (u one g minus u one f)

equals negative 0.045 plus 0.6 times (negative 333.458 minus negative 0.045)

equals negative 200.93

u z equals Q m two divided by m two w plus u one equals negative 2847 divided by 0.1 plus negative 200.93

equals negative 3047.93 kJ/kg
