A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as T (h) and the x-axis labeled as s (Ws/Tg/h). The graph contains several points labeled from 0 to 6, with lines connecting them. There are annotations indicating processes such as "isotrop" and "isotrop" with arrows pointing to the lines. The words "same pressure" and "isotrop" are written alongside the lines. An additional note mentions, "isobares are a little steep, they should probably be more like" with a sketch of a less steep line.
