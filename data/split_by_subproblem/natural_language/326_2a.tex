Delta U sub w minus U sub f at seventy degrees Celsius minus U sub f at twenty degrees Celsius equals negative eight point three five kilojoules per kilogram plus two hundred fifty two point nine five kilojoules per kilogram.  
Delta m times Delta U sub w plus thirty five times ten cubed kilograms equals twenty eight point three one times ten to the power of six kilojoules.  
Delta m equals twenty eight point three one times ten to the power of six kilojoules minus thirty five times ten cubed kilograms divided by Delta U sub w.  
Delta U sub w equals two hundred eight kilojoules per kilogram.  
Delta m equals one hundred thirty five point two eight four times ten cubed kilograms.

cp equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  
u equals k equals 1.4
