Since the ice is not yet melted, it is from the heat given constant since temperature is constant.

Temperature and pressure must decrease since heat melts.

O.H. equals heat after warm after cold melts.

Gas and ice in thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e., Q equals 0.

Ice equals 0 degrees Celsius must have the same temperature as ice water (0 degrees Celsius).

Otherwise, no ice would be present, then would equalize.

p one divided by T one equals p two divided by T two.

p two equals 2273 Pascal divided by 273.15 Kelvin equals 500 degrees Celsius equals 0 degrees Celsius equals 0.49 bar.
