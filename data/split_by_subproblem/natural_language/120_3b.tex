Since no additional force is applied, the process in the cylinder is isobaric, and the density of the water is equal to the density of the ice mixture, P2 equals P1g equals 1.4 bar.

Since we are in the ice-water region, condition 2 is T2w equals Tmu equals 0 degrees Celsius, and the state is in thermal equilibrium. Therefore, T2w equals T2g equals 0 degrees Celsius.
