Integral from s_a to s_e (T dS) is equal to ln of s_e minus ln of s_a over s_2 minus s_1 equals C divided by f (T_2 minus T_1) equals C divided by f (ln of T_2 over T_1).  
T bar_K_E equals (298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin) divided by ln of (298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin) equals 293.12 Kelvin.
