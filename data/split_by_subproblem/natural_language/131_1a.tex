(a) A graph is shown with the y-axis labeled as P and the x-axis labeled as T. The y-axis has a bracket labeled [P]. There are three regions marked on the graph: "Tripelpkt," "smtbr," and "unte Tripelpkt." There is a process depicted with arrows labeled 1, 2, and 3. The process includes sections labeled "isobar" and "isotherm."

(c) The equation is given as "massen = u2 - u1 over h" with T2 = -22°C. The difference in pressures is noted as "ps - pu." The heat transfer is described as "Q dot = 0 bei Provol" and "u right arrow u1 Energiebilanz." The energy balance equation is given as "dE over dt = m times (h_u - h_a) plus Q dot over c." The enthalpy is described as "h_u = h_f" with a change "A right arrow 1 (solide)." The enthalpy at the final state is "h_f = 53.42 kJ/kg." The enthalpy difference is noted as "Dwdl: h_u = h_a." The enthalpy at a given temperature and pressure is described as "h_a (T, p)" with "Erhalten T und p1 nach." The quality of the mixture is calculated as "x = h_x - h_f over h_g - h_f."

(d) The formula for efficiency is given as "E_t = [Q dot over (Q dot ul - Q dot k)] = C_k over [Q dot ul - Q dot k]."

(e) "Die Leistung würde sich steigern, weil mehr Arbeit geleistet werden würde."
