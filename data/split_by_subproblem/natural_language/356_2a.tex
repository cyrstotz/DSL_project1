A diagram is drawn with axes labeled 'T [U]' on the vertical axis and 'S [S]' on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes several processes labeled as follows:
- 'adiabat + is reversibel' from point 4 to point 3
- 'isobar' from point 3 to point 5
- 'isobar' from point 5 to point 2
- 'isentrop' from point 2 to point 1
- 'isentrop' from point 1 to point 0
- 'isentrop' from point 6 to point 0
The number 243.15 is marked on the vertical axis.

c) Delta e ex, str equals e x str, 6 minus e x, str, 0 equals ?

Delta e x, str, 6 equals Delta h 0G minus T 0 (s 6 minus s 0) plus Delta k e 0G

Delta h 0G equals integral from T 0 to T 6 of c p dT equals c p (T 6 minus T 0) equals 360 / 273 / 48 u 5

Delta s 60 equals integral from T 0 to T 6 of c p over T dT minus R ln (p 6 over p 0) equals

equals c p (ln (T 6) minus ln (T 0)) minus R ln (p 6 over p 0) equals

equals 6,30135 J/kg

Delta k e 0C equals (omega 6 squared minus omega 0 squared) over 2 equals 108,642 J/kg

=> Delta e x, str equals Delta h minus T 0 Delta s plus Delta k e equals 118,426 J/kg
