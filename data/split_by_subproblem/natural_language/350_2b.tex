Energy balance at point 5-6.

Determine T6 using polytropic exponent.

Equation: p6 minus p0 equals 0.191 bar.

Equation: T6 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to 1.9 times T5 equals 328.07 Kelvin equals T6.

Energy balance over 5-6; state FP.

Equation: m times (h5 minus h6 plus 220 squared divided by 2 minus UV6 squared divided by 2) equals 0, in steady state.

Equation: h5 minus h6 equals cp times (T5 minus T6).

Equation: h3 minus h6 plus 220 squared divided by 2 minus UV6 squared divided by 2 equals 0.

Equation: 1.006 times 1000 times (431.9 minus 328.07) plus 220 squared divided by 2 equals UV6 squared divided by 2 equals 128651.98.

Equation: UV6 equals square root of 2 times 128651.

Equation: UV6 equals 507.25 meters per second.
