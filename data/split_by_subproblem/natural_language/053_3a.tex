Phi times P g1 V g1 equals M g1 R T g1.

P g1 equals one bar plus M e w g divided by A plus M g divided by A equals one hundred thousand Pascal plus two point four times zero point eight one meters divided by twenty-five square centimeters plus thirty-two times nine point eight meters per second squared divided by twenty-five square centimeters.

P h equals one point four zero zero nine four bar.

M g1 equals P g1 V g1 divided by R T g1 equals zero point zero zero eight four nine two V g1.

R equals R divided by M.

V g1 equals three point seven four liters.
