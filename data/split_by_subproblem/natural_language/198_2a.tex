A diagram with temperature (T) and entropy (s) axes is shown. The diagram includes lines labeled as 'isobar', 'isentrope', and 'isobac'. Points are marked as 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 along these lines. The lines are connecting points as follows: 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6. Annotations include 'P2', 'P0 = P0 = 0,159 bar', '0.5 bar = p5', and 'pr = 0.5 bar'.

Pn > Po
Pe = Po
P2 = p3

1) Cool T6
Energy balance:

O = gamma 5 (h5 - h6 + (w5 squared - w6 squared divided by 2)) + Q dot - mu O

h5 - h6 = Cp (T5 - T6)

T0:

T0 = T5 (0,159 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of n - 1 divided by n

T6 = 431.96 K (0.159 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4 = 328.075 K

w0 = - square root of (w05 squared + 2 times (h5 - h6))
