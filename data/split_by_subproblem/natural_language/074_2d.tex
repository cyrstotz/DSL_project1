E dot x, loss equals T zero times S dot gen

Entropy balance

Zero equals m dot times the quantity s e minus s a plus the sum of Q dot divided by T plus S dot gen

S dot gen equals m dot times the quantity s a minus s e minus Q dot divided by T

E x, loss equals T zero times the quantity m dot times the quantity s a minus x e minus Q dot divided by T
