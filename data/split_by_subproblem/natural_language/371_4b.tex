1st Law of Thermodynamics at the compressor:  
Zero equals mass times (h two minus h three) plus W dot k.  
Negative m dot equals V dot k divided by h two minus h three equals 28 Watts divided by h two minus h three.  

(h two minus h three) adiabat-reversible equals isentropic implies s two equals s three equals s four (p equals 8 bar) equals 0.506 kilojoule per kilogram Kelvin (TAB A1.1).  

h two equals h g (8 bar) equals 264.1 kilojoule per kilogram (TAB A1.1).  

h three equals h two minus s three.
