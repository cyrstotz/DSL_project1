a) Ts Diagram

[Diagram with an x-axis labeled 'S [kJ/kgK]' and a y-axis labeled 'T [K]'. It shows a closed loop with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 6, and arrows indicating processes: isobar, isochoric, isotherm, and isentrop. The line from point 3 to point 6 has annotations 'p3 = p1' and 'po = pa'.]

Two times (1.006 times (328.047 minus 243.15) minus 1.995 divided by 5.298) minus 200 squared minus Wg squared

200 squared minus 280622.233 J equals Wg squared

Wg equals 490.6 m/s
