wc equals 5 times 10 to the power of 3, TG equals 340 K. 

A statement 'aus Formelsammlung': delta ex,st equals hG minus hO minus TG times (sG minus sO) plus wG squared divided by 2 minus wO squared divided by 2. 

An equation: hG minus hO equals CP times (TG minus TO), sG minus sO equals CP times ln (TG divided by TO) minus e times ln (pO divided by pG). 

An equation: equals CP times (TG minus TO) minus CP times ln (TG divided by TO) plus wG squared divided by 2 minus wO squared divided by 2. 

Equals 125.47 kJ divided by kg.
