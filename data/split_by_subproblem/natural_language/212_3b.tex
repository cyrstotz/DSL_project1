p sub 0 equals 1.56 bar, m sub G equals 3.6 grams. p times V equals m times R times T. p sub 2 equals p sub 1, therefore the pressure must remain equal because the system is in equilibrium and the weight of the piston does not change, only the air pressure changes. T equals p times V divided by m times R.
