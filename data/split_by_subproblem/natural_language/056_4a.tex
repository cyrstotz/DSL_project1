The page contains two graphs.

The first graph is labeled with "Aufgabe 4" at the top left corner. The vertical axis is labeled "p mbar" with values ranging from 0.01 to 100. The horizontal axis is labeled "T degrees Celsius" with values from -30 to 0. There is a curve that starts at the lower left and rises towards the right. The graph includes labels for different states: "fest" (solid), "fl端ssig" (liquid), and "gas" (gas). There is a point labeled "Tripel" (triple) and lines indicating different phases: "fl端ssig gas" (liquid gas) and "fest fl端ssig" (solid liquid). The region labeled "Nassdampf gas" (wet steam gas) is indicated with dashed lines.

The second graph is below the first one. It has a similar layout with the vertical axis labeled "p mbar" with values from 0.01 to 10. The horizontal axis is labeled "T degrees Celsius" with values from -30 to 0. This graph also includes labels for states: "Fest" (solid), "fl端ssig" (liquid), and "gas" (gas). There is a curve starting at the lower left and rising towards the right, with a point labeled "Tripel" (triple). Additionally, there is a notation "(ii) T2 -> (T1)" near the curve.
