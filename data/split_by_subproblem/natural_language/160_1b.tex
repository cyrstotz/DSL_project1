T bar equals the integral from se to sa of T ds divided by (sa minus se).

q divided by T equals s, which implies T equals q divided by s.

Equals Q dot aus times the natural logarithm of (sa divided by se) divided by (sa minus se).

Equals Q dot aus times the natural logarithm of (sa divided by se) divided by ci times the natural logarithm of (Te divided by T1).

sa minus se equals the integral from T1 to T2 of ci divided by T dT equals ci times the natural logarithm of (T2 divided by T1).
