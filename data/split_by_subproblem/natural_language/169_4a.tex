A graph with the vertical axis labeled as 'p' and the horizontal axis with no label. The graph shows a complex curve with four numbered points labeled '1', '2', '3', and '4'. There are lines connecting these points. There is a horizontal line labeled 'isobar' and another horizontal line labeled 'x equals zero'. Another line is labeled 'x equals one'. The pressure is labeled as 'p equals 5 bar'.

Below this graph, there is another graph with the vertical axis labeled as 'p' and the horizontal axis labeled as 'T'. This graph shows a bell-shaped curve with three numbered points labeled '1', '2', and '3'. There is a horizontal line labeled 'isobar equals 8 bar' and another horizontal line labeled 'x equals zero'. Another line is labeled 'x equals one'. The graph has a vertical line labeled 'isobar'.
