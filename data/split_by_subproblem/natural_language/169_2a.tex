A graph is depicted with temperature T in Kelvin on the vertical axis and entropy s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The graph includes lines labeled as isobare p5 equals 0.5 bar, isobare p0 equals p6 equals 0.191 bar, and an isentropic (adiabatic reversible) process. The temperature values marked are 431.9 K and 243.15 K. Points are labeled as 5 and 6.
