Another graph is depicted with an x-axis labeled 's' and a y-axis labeled 'T'. Several curves and lines are drawn:

- A line from point '0' to point '1' with an annotation 'isobar'.
- A line from point '2' to point '3', labeled 'm dot K'.
- A line from point '4' to point '5', labeled 'm dot M'.
- Point '6' is annotated with '0.1936 m'.
- A note next to the graph indicates '0.5 bar'.
