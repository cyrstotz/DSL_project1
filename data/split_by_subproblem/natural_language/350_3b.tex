T subscript g2 divided by p subscript g2

(If it matches, then x subscript 1 plus x less than x subscript 2 before)

Temperature of the gas will decrease due to heat transfer m g

Pressure remains p subscript 1 because the external conditions do not change

Temperature will barely reach 0 degrees Celsius because the water has a higher heat capacity

Because it first undergoes a phase transition at 0 degrees Celsius, the energy costs

Solid to liquid requires energy from the air, changes

T subscript g approaches 0 degrees Celsius

p subscript 2 equals p subscript 1
