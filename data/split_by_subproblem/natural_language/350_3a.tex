p subscript g1 equals question mark

p equals m R T divided by V

C subscript V equals 0.33 kilojoules divided by kilogram Kelvin

M equals 50 kilograms divided by kilomole

p subscript g equals p ambient plus m g plus m e w g divided by A

p subscript g is counter pressure to water and environment

equals 100,000 plus 32 plus 6.1 times 9.81 divided by 0.0319

equals 100,000 plus 10,000 pascal

A equals r squared times pi

equals 0.1 squared times pi equals 0.031416 square meters

m subscript g equals p V divided by R T

equals 110,000 minus 0.0319 divided by 8,314 joules divided by kilogram Kelvin divided by 50 kilomole

R equals 500 plus 273.15 Kelvin

equals 0.002687 kilograms equals m subscript g

equals approximately 2.687 grams
