G equals m tot times (h five minus h six plus W five squared minus W six squared divided by two) minus W t // isentrop

h five minus h six plus W five squared minus W six squared divided by two equals W t

W t equals integral from five to six of v d p equals integral from five to six of v d p plus delta ice

T six minus T five equals (T four, six divided by T five) to the power of n minus one divided by n (Isentrop) equals 93.49 (T four, six divided by T five) to the power of n minus one divided by n equals 323.07 K

h five minus h six equals c p times (T five divided by T six) equals 1.006 times (93.49 minus 328.07) equals 109.95 kJ divided by kg

Delta h plus one half W five squared minus one half W six squared equals integral from five to six of v d p minus delta ice

Delta h plus one half W five squared minus one half W six squared equals integral from five to six of v d p minus (one half W five squared minus one half W six squared)

Delta h plus W six squared minus W five squared equals integral from five to six of v d p

Delta h plus W six squared plus integral from six to five of v d p equals W six squared
