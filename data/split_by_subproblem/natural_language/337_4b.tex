The question "mR134a = ?" is posed. Below it, a diagram of a cycle is drawn with arrows pointing from '2' to '3', labeled with Wk. 

An equation is written:
dE/dt = -ṁR (h2 - h3) + Q̇ - Ẇk

Another equation is written:
Ẇk/h2 - h3 = ṁR134

Further calculations are noted:
h2 (8 bar, x2 = 1) = hg (8 bar) TAB A14 = 264.15 kJ/kg
h3 (8 bar, S2) => interpolieren @ 8 bar mit S2 : h3 = h (sx) - h (sr) / sx - sr (s2 - sr) + hf

Another calculation is noted:
S2 (8 bar, x = 1) = 0.9066 kJ/kg K = S3
