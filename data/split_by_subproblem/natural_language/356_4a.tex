A graph is drawn with axes labeled P and T, where P is measured in millibars and T is measured in degrees Celsius. The vertical axis P has a value of 10 marked. The horizontal axis T starts at 0. The graph includes three points labeled 1, 2, and 3. 

Point 1 is on the horizontal axis, labeled with "(i)" and "wasser" (water). Point 2 is slightly above the horizontal axis and labeled with "(ii)" and "Eis" (ice). Point 3 is at the top of the graph, labeled with "(iii)" and "gas." 

A line connects points 1 and 2 horizontally with the label "isobar," and a vertical line connects points 2 and 3 with the label "isotherm." There is a mention of "triple point" near point 1. 

Some text is crossed out near the bottom left, but it is not legible.
