A formula is written: 
Q equals m times (h sub e minus h sub a) plus ke plus v squared divided by 2 plus Q dot minus w.

Another formula is written: 
W equals m times (h sub e minus h sub a) equals m times (h sub 2 minus h sub 3).

A formula for m is given: 
m equals W divided by (h sub a minus h sub 3).

The variables h sub 2 and h sub 3 are listed with spaces for values:
h sub 2 equals 
h sub 3 equals

Ek equals Qzu divided by V4 equals 5.87. Qzu equals Qzu equals m times (h2 minus h1) equals 42.764.24 kilojoules.
