p1 equals 7.5 bar, m equals 3.6 g

T gas equals 0 degrees Celsius

T2 divided by Tn equals (p2 divided by p1) to the power of n minus 1 divided by n

n equals c sub p divided by c sub v equals 0.63936 divided by 0.6 equals 1.067

R equals c sub p minus c sub v equals R plus c sub v

c sub p divided by c sub p equals 0.63936 equals 0.63936

n equals 0.63936 divided by 0.633 equals 1.00025

p2 equals (T2 divided by Tn) to the power of n divided by n minus 1 times p1

The temperature is the same as the ice, as the ice temperature cannot change with x greater than or equal to 70
