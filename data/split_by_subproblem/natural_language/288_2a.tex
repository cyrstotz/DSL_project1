A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled T in brackets K and the x-axis labeled S in brackets with a symbol resembling a summation sign followed by a fraction in brackets. The graph contains several curves labeled with numbers and points P0, P1 equals P5 equals P4, P2 equals P3. The numbers on the curves are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

T2 equals Teis,1 equals zero degrees Celsius because x2 is greater than zero and thermal equilibrium.

Q12 equals m times g times (Teis,1 minus Tgi,1) equals 9.54228 times 10 to the power of minus 3 times 0.633 times (273.15 minus 273.15) equals negative 0.8046 kilojoules.

In Eis flows negative Q12.
