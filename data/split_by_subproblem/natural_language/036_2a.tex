A graph is drawn with an axis labeled T in Kelvin on the vertical and delta S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the horizontal. The graph shows a curve with several numbered points: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The curve between points 1 and 2 is labeled 'isotrop', between points 2 and 3 is labeled 'isobar', between points 3 and 4 is labeled 'isobar', between points 4 and 5 is labeled 'isotrop', and between points 5 and 6 is labeled 'isotrop'. There is a note indicating P sub D equals P sub O, which is labeled as 'isobar'.
