Pg2 should remain small, so that p0 does not change and the mass of the gas remains constant

Pg2 equals 1.44 bar

Tg1,2: The water is not sufficiently heated with energy, as the gas for a fixed component is supplied externally, i.e., the gas is heated externally by means of the surrounding water

=> Tg1,2 x equals 0 equals 0.00038
