p bar sub 2, p sub 2  
p sub 2 is approximately equal to p sub 1 because the force slash pressure equilibrium always only occupies the same.  
p bar sub 2 equals 1.401 bar.  
Because the x sub 2 is greater than zero, the temperature of E must always lie at zero degrees Celsius.  
Because in state 2 Q sub ab equals zero is, T sub s2 must also be zero degrees Celsius.
