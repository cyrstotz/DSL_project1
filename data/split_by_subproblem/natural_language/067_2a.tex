A graph is depicted with temperature T in Kelvin on the y-axis and entropy S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the x-axis. The graph shows a process with numbered points 1 through 6, connected by lines. The points are marked with circles and asterisks, with the asterisks indicating isobars. The pressures are noted as p sub s equals 0.5 bar and p sub 0 equals 0.191 bar.
