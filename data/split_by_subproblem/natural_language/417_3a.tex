p g1 is equal to p e minus m g over A plus m e g over A.

A is equal to pi times (D over 2) squared.
A is equal to pi times (0.1 meters over 2) squared.
A is equal to 0.0079 square meters.

p g1 is equal to 100 times CO2 times 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared over 0.0079 square meters plus Q times 1 mg times 9.81 meters per second squared over 0.0079 square meters.

D g1 is equal to 1.4 bar.

p V is equal to m times Z T.

p g1 times V g1 is equal to m g times Z over Z g1 times T g1.

Therefore, m g is equal to p g1 times V over Z g1 times T g1.
