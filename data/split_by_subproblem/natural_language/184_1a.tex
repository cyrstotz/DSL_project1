0 equals m dot times (he minus ha) plus sum of Q dot minus sum of E dot

equals m dot times (he minus ha) plus Q dot R minus Q dot aus

implies Q dot aus equals m dot times (he minus ha) plus Q dot R

he minus ha: because side value is specific heat capacity at seventy degrees Celsius and one hundred degrees Celsius

he: TAB twelve seventy degrees Celsius 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram

ha: one hundred degrees Celsius 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram

he minus ha implies Q dot aus equals 0.3 times (292.98 times ten to the power of three minus 419.04 times ten to the power of three) plus 100 times ten to the power of three

equals 62.182 kilowatts

(Must be negative without a jacket implies Q dot aus equals minus 62.182 kilowatts)

1.083 kilojoules absorbed  
m times the absolute value of (u two minus u one) equals Q

Ti equals zero degrees Celsius
