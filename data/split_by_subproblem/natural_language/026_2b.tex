5 to 6 is isentropic

T six equals T five times (P six divided by P five) to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n) equals 328.07 Kelvin equals T six

Energy balance equation:
0 equals m dot times (h six minus h five) plus m dot divided by n times (w six squared minus w five squared divided by 2) plus Q dot zero minus Q dot zero

2 times (h six minus h five) equals w six squared minus w five squared arrow w five squared minus w six squared equals 2 times (h six minus h five)
