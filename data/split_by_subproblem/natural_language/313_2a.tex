A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled 'T' and the x-axis labeled 'S'. The graph depicts an isochore heat curve. Various processes are annotated on the graph: adiabatic reversible, adiabatic irreversible, isochore, and adiabatic reversible with beta equals one. There is also an annotation for adiabatic reversible turbine, adiabatic irreversible turbine, and adiabatic reversible compression.
