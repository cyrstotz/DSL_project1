omega equals 220 meters per second
p5 equals 0.5 bar
T5 equals 431.9 K

isentrop 5 to 6

Equation:
Tc over T5 equals (pc over p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) over n

n equals k

Tc equals (0.191 bar over 0.5 bar) raised to the power of 0.4 over 7.14 times 431.9 K equals 328.07 K equals Tc

Equation:
O equals m times (h5 minus hc plus (omega squared over 5 minus omega squared over c) over 2) times [1 plus x dot over x dot] plus square root of 2 times (hc minus h5) plus omega squared over 5 plus omega squared minus omega over c
