A graph is shown with an x-axis labeled 's' and a y-axis labeled 'n'. There are six marked points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Lines connect these points in a zigzag pattern. The lines are labeled as follows:
- Between points 0 and 1: "adiabatic reversible"
- Between points 1 and 2: "u,5 isochore"
- Between points 2 and 3: "inverse"
- Between points 3 and 4: "adiabatic reversible"
- Between points 4 and 5: "0,131 isochore"
- Between points 5 and 6: "inverse"

There is a crossed-out section with equations and annotations.
