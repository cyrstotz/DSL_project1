A graph is presented with a y-axis labeled 'T' and an x-axis labeled with 's'. The graph shows a curve with three marked points labeled 1, 2, and 3. The y-axis has points labeled T1 and T2, and the x-axis has points labeled s1, s2, s3, and s4. 

1. adiabatic (reversible) implies s1 equals s2, T1 goes to T2
2. isobar, isoenthalpic
3.
