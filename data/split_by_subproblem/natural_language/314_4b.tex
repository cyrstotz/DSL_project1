A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as p in brackets bar and the x-axis labeled as T in brackets degrees Celsius. The graph shows a curve starting from the bottom left corner, labeled "solid," and moving upwards and to the right. The curve transitions into a horizontal line labeled "liquid," and further to the right, it is labeled "gas" with an accompanying label "isobar."
