Force law:  
Since EW is incompressible: p G1 equals p amb plus A times M times g  
A equals (theta divided by two squared) times pi  
p G1 equals 1.3897 bar  

Mg: Ideal gas law:  
P times V equals m times R times T  
m equals P times V divided by R times T  
noble R equals R divided by M equals 166.28 divided by 166 equals 1 kg divided by kg  
m G equals p a times V a times m divided by R times T G1 equals 3.478 g
