The heading 'isotrope schubd√ºse' is written. An equation is given: TG divided by TS equals PC divided by PS to the power of n minus 1 divided by n. Another equation follows: TG equals PS multiplied by TS multiplied by (PC divided by PS) to the power of n minus 1 divided by n, which equals 431.9 multiplied by (0.19 divided by 0.5) to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4, which equals 328.97 K equals TG. 

A statement labeled 1.HS: dE divided by dt equals m dot multiplied by (hs plus ws squared divided by 2 minus hG minus vG squared divided by 2) plus the sum of e dot times wi minus e dot times wn. 

An equation for wG: (hs plus ws squared divided by 2 minus hG) times 2. 

Another equation: hs minus hG equals CP times (TS minus TG) equals 257.3 J divided by kg. 

An equation for wG: square root of 2 times (CP times (TS minus TG) plus ws squared divided by 2) equals 487.3 meters per second.
