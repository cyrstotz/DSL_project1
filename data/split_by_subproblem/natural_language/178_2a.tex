The page contains three graphs. 

1. The first graph is labeled with 'T [K]' on the vertical axis and 'S [kJ/kg]' on the horizontal axis. It features a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Arrows indicate the direction of the curve between these points. The graph also includes labels such as 'isobar' and 'p2 = p3'.

2. The second graph, below the first, has 'T [K]' on the vertical axis and 'S' on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, and arrows indicating the direction between these points.

3. The third graph, to the right of the second, is labeled with 'T [K]' on the vertical axis and 'S' on the horizontal axis. It features a curve with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with arrows indicating the direction between these points. The graph includes labels such as 'isobar' and 'isotherm'. 

The page is titled 'Aufgabe 2'.
