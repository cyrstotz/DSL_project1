A second graph is presented with pressure (P) in mbar on the y-axis and temperature (T) in Kelvin (K) on the x-axis. The graph shows a similar curve with a peak. There are three points labeled 1, 2, and 3, with point 1 connected to point 2 by a horizontal line. The line labeled "isobare Abk√ºhlung" is drawn horizontally from point 1. Two dashed lines are labeled 10 mbar and 5 mbar. The term "isotherm" is written near the bottom left of the graph.
