Tb equals Ts times the fraction (Ps over Pb) raised to the power of (n minus 1 over u). This equals 431.9 Kelvin. In parentheses, there is 0.3 bar over 0.191 kilobar, and beside it, 1.4 minus 1 over 1.4. This equals 568.58 Kelvin, which is underlined.

Equation: 0 equals (crossed out terms) plus h5 minus h6 plus one-half times ws squared minus w6 squared.

One-half times wb squared equals h5 minus h6 plus one-half ws squared equals cpig times (Ts minus Tb) plus one-half ws squared.

Calculation: 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (431.9 Kelvin minus 340 Kelvin) plus (220 meters per second) squared.

wb squared equals (2.429 squared times 2.454 meters squared per second squared) equals (crossed out terms) 341.72.
