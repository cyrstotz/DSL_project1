Two diagrams are drawn. The first diagram shows pressure in kilopascals on the y-axis and temperature in degrees Celsius on the x-axis. It depicts three phases: gaseous, solid, and liquid. Points are labeled 1, 2, 3, and a line titled "gasförmig" (gaseous), "fest" (solid), and "flüssig" (liquid) are shown. The second diagram also shows pressure in kilopascals on the y-axis and temperature in degrees Celsius on the x-axis with similar lines and labels.
