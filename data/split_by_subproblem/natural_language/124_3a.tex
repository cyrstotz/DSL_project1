p_g = m times g over A plus p_atm, A equals pi times D squared over four equals pi times 0.7 meters squared over four. p_g equals m_w plus m_k times g over pi times 0.1 meters squared plus p_atm equals 0.7 kilograms plus 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared over pi times 0.7 meters squared plus 10 to the power of 5 pascals equals 7.7 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals equals 7.7 bar. p times V equals m times R over M times T equals m times R over M times T, R equals 8.374 kilojoules per kilogram mole over 50 grams per mole. m_3 equals p_g, V_3, 1, M_3 over R times T equals 7.7 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 3.79 times 10 to the power of minus 3 cubic meters times 50 grams per mole over 8.379 joules per kelvin mole times 773.75 kelvin equals 28.40 grams.
