x one equals 0.6, zero degrees Celsius.  
U one equals V (T equals zero degrees Celsius, x equals 0.6) equals U fresh plus x (U frozen minus U fresh) equals approximately negative 733.9702.  
Q equals m times w times (u two minus u one) equals 8.8758 s.  

V two equals Q divided by m times w plus U one equals 98.736 J divided by kg plus negative 733.9702 J divided by kg equals negative 37.6806 J divided by kg.  
T two equals 0.0003 degrees Celsius.  
x equals V two minus V fresh divided by U frozen minus U fresh equals 0.896081.
