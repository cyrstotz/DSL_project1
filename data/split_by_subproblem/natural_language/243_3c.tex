Q equals OE equals Q 12 minus U zero squared equals OU equals Cv times (T 2 minus T zero) equals (Cp minus R divided by M) times (T 2 minus T zero) equals 9.46672 times (0.003 squared times 500 minus 500) equals minus 753.4683.  
V zero equals m dot times R times T divided by P equals 0.002 times 8.514 times 200 divided by 30 times (27.73 plus 8.514) divided by 7.5 times 10 cubed equals 0.00.  
Cv equals Cp minus R divided by M equals 0.46672.
