First law of thermodynamics closed system Delta U equals Q plus W equals zero. Q equals Delta U equals mU one minus mU a one. U one equals U F plus x times U FG minus U FL equals minus two hundred point one one six eight kilojoules per kilogram. mU two equals mU one plus. L equals mU two equals mU one plus L times one. L equals one thousand five hundred kilograms plus zero point one five kilograms times minus two hundred point one one six eight kilojoules per kilogram equals four hundred forty one point eight eight two minus twenty eight point five eight kilojoules per kilogram.
