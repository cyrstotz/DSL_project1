There is a table with columns labeled rho, T, and w. The rows are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 with corresponding values:

- rho: 1.1281
- T: 293.15
- w: 700

Below the table, there are calculations and equations:

1) Equation: u equals h5 minus h6 plus (w5 squared minus w6 squared) divided by 2.

2) Isentropic condition: n equals k equals 1.4.

3) T6 equals T5 multiplied by (p6 divided by p5) to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k) equals 328.07 K.

4) u5 squared equals 2 times cp times (T5 minus T6) plus w5 squared divided by 2.

5) Equation: 0 equals integral from 5 to 6 of cp times dT plus w6 squared minus w5 squared divided by 2.

c) Equation: q equals h6 minus h0 equals (cp times (T6 minus T0) plus x times hfg minus hfg0).

s6 equals s0 minus cp times ln(T6 divided by T0) plus R times ln(p6 divided by p0).

R equals cpL minus cp divided by k.

w6 equals 371.465 meters per second.

h6 minus h0 equals cp times (T6 minus T0) equals 85.43 kilojoules per kilogram.

R equals cpL minus cp divided by k equals 0.3013 kilojoules per kilogram.
