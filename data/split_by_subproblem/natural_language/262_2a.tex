T-S Diagram

T subscript zero equals 293.15 Kelvin

A graph is drawn with a vertical axis labeled T subscript zero and a horizontal axis labeled S subscript zero, S subscript 2, S subscript 4. The graph shows several points and lines connecting them:

- Point 0 is at the bottom left.
- A vertical line goes from point 0 to point 1, labeled "reversible, isochoric."
- From point 1 to point 2, there is a horizontal line labeled "reversible, isobaric."
- From point 2 to point 3, a curve is drawn labeled "isobar."
- From point 3 to point 4, a curve is labeled "adiabatic, irreversible."
- From point 4 to point 5, a curve is labeled "isobar."
- From point 5 to point 6, a vertical line is labeled "reversible."

There is a horizontal line extending from point 0 to the right, labeled "DS" with a note "kJ/kg*K" next to it.
