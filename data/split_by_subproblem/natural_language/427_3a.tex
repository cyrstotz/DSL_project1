A equals pi times (D divided by 2) squared equals 25 pi centimeters squared equals 25 pi times 10 to the power of negative 4 square meters.

Poben equals (mK plus mEW) divided by A plus Pomb equals (32 kilograms plus 0.1 kilograms) times 9.81 newtons per kilogram divided by 25 pi times 10 to the power of negative 4 square meters plus 1 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals approximately 140 kilopascals equals 1.4 bar.

Mechanische Gleichgewicht: Pgas equals Poben approximately 1.4 bar.

Rg equals R divided by Mg equals 8.314 joules per mole times kelvin divided by 50 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms per mole equals 166.28 joules per kilogram times kelvin.

Mg equals (Pvd divided by Rg times Tgas) times (Pvd divided by Pgas) equals (1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters) divided by (166.28 joules per kilogram times kelvin times 273.15 kelvin) approximately 0.0034 kilograms equals 3.4 grams.
