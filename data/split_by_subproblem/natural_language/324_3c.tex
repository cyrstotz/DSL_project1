Consider the first law for a closed system.  
Delta U equals Q one two minus W one two.  
Delta U equals m c V (T two minus T one).  
Delta U equals 0.0034 times 0.633 (0 minus 500).  
Delta U equals negative 1076.1.  

W one two: isochoric compression.  
W one two: p one V two three (V two three minus V one three) equals negative 285.54 J.  

p two V two three equals R T m two.  
V two three equals R T m two divided by p two equals 0.0011 cubic meters.  

T two equals 0 degrees Celsius.  
m one equals m two.  
p two equals p one.  

Q one two equals Delta U plus W one two.  
Q one two equals negative 1076.1 J minus 285.54 J equals negative 1361.64 J.
