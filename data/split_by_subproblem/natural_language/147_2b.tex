Energy balance for the stationary flow process is described with equations:

T6 divided by T5 equals (P6 divided by P5) to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n, leading to T6 equals T5 times (P6 divided by P5) to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n, which equals (293.9 K) times (0.194 bar divided by 0.5 bar) to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4, resulting in 328.07 K.

The energy balance for the stationary flow process is:

0 equals m dot times (h5 minus h6 plus (w5 squared minus w6 squared) divided by 2) plus g times (z5 minus z6) times 1 plus sum of q dot minus sum of w dot equals 0 (adiabatic) equals 0 (discharge).

Final equation:

0 equals h5 minus h6 plus (w5 squared minus w6 squared) divided by 2.
