b) T KF = integral from S1 to S2 of T ds = integral from S1 to S2 of c if dT = integral from T1 to T2 of c if dT
c if = constant

h2 - h1 = c if (T2 - T1)

= integral from T1 to T2 of T ds / c if (ln(T2/T1))

= (T2 - T1) / ln(T2/T1) = 283.12 K

X less than or equal to 70

given Tgi2 and pgi2

pgi2 equals pgi1 since the water is incompressible and the ice melting leads to no volume change. Therefore, the TEW is isochor and the equation (1) from a) is also valid for b).

Tgi2 divided by Tgn equals (V divided by V2) raised to the power of n minus 1

Tgi2 equals Tgn times (V divided by V2) raised to the power of n minus 1 (2)

p2i times Vgi2 equals mg times R times Tgi2 equals Vgi2 equals mg times R times Tgi2 divided by p2ig (3)

(3) to (2): Tgi2 equals Tgn times mg times R times Tgi2 divided by p2ig times Vn
