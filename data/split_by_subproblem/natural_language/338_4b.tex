A diagram of a circular component with three arrows is shown. The arrows are labeled as 2, 3, and W with a subscript 'K'. Below the diagram, the following equations and notes are written:

O equals m times (h2 minus h3) minus W with a subscript 'K'.

h2 and h3 (8 bar) are noted with an arrow pointing to the right.

s2 equals s3.

s3 superheated.

s3 (8 bar) equals.
