Given: wb, T6

The equation for stationary flow process in total isothermal, adiabatic:

0 = heinz minus hlauf plus (weinz squared minus wans squared) divided by 2

wans = square root of (2 times (heinz minus hlauf) plus weinz squared)

Ideal gas: cp,mitt (Taus minus Tein) plus vi squared (P3 minus P1)

Taus: Taus divided by Tein equals (P0 divided by P0) to the power of (1.4 minus 1) divided by 1.4, which simplifies to Taus equals Tein.

Thus, it is wans equals weinz.

Steady flow process in a nozzle: Energy balance, the reversible. Adiabatic: h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2 equals 0.

w5 squared equals square root of 2 times (h5 minus h6) plus w5 squared equals 220 meters squared per second squared.

Tb equals 75 times (Pb divided by P5) to the power of k minus 1 divided by k equals 328.07468 Kelvin.
