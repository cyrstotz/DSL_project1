x equals h minus hf divided by hg minus hf

p1 equals eight bar, x1 equals zero, t equals thirty-one point thirty-three

Der Kreislauf ist isotherm.

h4 equals h1

h4 equals hf of eight bar from Table A-11 equals eighty-five point forty-two kilojoules per kilogram

T triple equals zero degrees Celsius

Ti equals zero degrees Celsius plus ten equals ten degrees Celsius

T1 equals four degrees Celsius (Table A-10)

x equals h4 minus hf of four degrees Celsius divided by hg of ten degrees Celsius minus hf of ten degrees Celsius equals eighty-five point forty-two minus fifty-five point thirty-five divided by two hundred forty-eight point fifty-three minus fifty-five point thirty-five equals zero point one nine six
