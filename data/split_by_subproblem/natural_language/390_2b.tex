The header "TASK 2b" is followed by equations and descriptions. The first equation is "0 = m dot h dot (h4 minus h3 plus w2 squared minus w1 squared) plus Q dot 2v," with a note next to it stating "with all in T0 the others in the conditions of p0 and p3." Another equation is "W dot q = 2 (h2 minus h3) plus w2 squared plus 2 Q dot 2v over m gas." Below, it states "besides Q dot 2v equals m dot k times qB," and "m dot equals m gas over (1 plus q23)." It further explains "2 Q dot 2v over m gas equals qB over (1 plus q23) equals 98 over (1 plus q23) equals 98 over (1 plus q23) plus 2 qB over G23." The final equation is "h2 minus h3 equals cP h dot (Tq minus T0)."
