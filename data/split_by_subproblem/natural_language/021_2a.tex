A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph depicts a cycle with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The initial point is marked as 1, and the final point is marked as 6. The following pressures are indicated: p0 equals 0.194 bar and p5 equals 0.5 bar.
