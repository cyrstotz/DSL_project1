Tc equals Ts times (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of k minus one divided by k  
Equals 328.07 Kelvin (underlined)

1. HS 5 to 6:  
Zero equals h5 minus h6 plus omega5 squared minus omega6 squared divided by 2  
Implies omega6 squared equals omega5 squared plus 2 times c times p divided by omega times (T5 minus Tc) equals 25730 meters per second  
omega6 equals 507.24 meters per second (underlined)

n equals k (isentrop)
