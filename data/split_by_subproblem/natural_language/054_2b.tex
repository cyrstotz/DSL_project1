Steady-state flow process: 0 equals m dot times the sum of (h0 minus h6 plus WE squared minus W6 squared) divided by 2. 
This implies WE equals the square root of 2 times (h0 minus h6) plus W6 squared.

h0 minus h6 equals Cp times (T0 minus T6).
s5 equals s6 implies T6 divided by T5 equals (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4, which implies T6 equals T5 times (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4 equals 328.07 Kelvin.

Therefore, WE equals the square root of 1006 meters squared per second squared times (253.15 Kelvin minus 328.07 Kelvin) plus 200 squared meters squared per second squared, which equals 194.6 meters per second.
