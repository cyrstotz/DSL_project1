Delta e x ishr equals e x sht six minus e x isht zero

equals h six minus h zero minus T zero times (s six minus s zero) plus ke where ke equals w six squared divided by two minus w zero squared divided by two

equals Cp times (T six minus T zero) minus T zero times (cp times ln (T six divided by T zero) minus R times ln (p zero divided by p zero)) plus w six squared divided by two minus w zero squared divided by two

equals zero

Q12 dilates the gas:  
therefore ΔE = Δu12^0 + Q12 - W12  
W12 = ∫ from V1 to V2 of pdV = pM1 (V2 - V1) = -3044.52 J  
V2 = R T2 / pM2 = 4.26 x 10^-5 m^3  
pM2 = 1.98 bar  

W12, V = R (T2 - T1) / 1 - n = 4345 kJ  
n = (R + Cv) / Cv = 1.26  

|Q12| = 1199.4 J with mother result checked
