dE over dt equals m dot times (h one minus h two) plus the sum of Q dot minus the sum of W dot. Delta E equals delta m one two times (h one minus h two). Delta E equals delta U equals U two minus U one. Therefore, delta m one two equals u two minus u one over h one minus h two equals C times (T two minus T one) over C times (T one minus T two) equals infinity.
