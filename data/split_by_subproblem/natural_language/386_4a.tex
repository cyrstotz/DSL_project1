A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis. The graph shows three phases labeled as 'Fest' (solid), 'Fl√ºssig' (liquid), and 'Gas' (gas). The graph includes a line labeled 'Tripel' (triple point) and points labeled '1', '2', and 'O'. The area between points '1' and 'O' is shaded.
