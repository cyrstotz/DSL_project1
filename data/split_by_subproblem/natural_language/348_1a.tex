The process reactor is isothermal, since the mass flow rate is also constant.

Energy balance reactor:
Q out plus Q R

Stationary
Zero equals in (che in) plus Q dot minus sigma delta H n

W equals zero, therefore no work is done, only change in enthalpy of substances.

Warm T equals 70 degrees Celsius equals saturated steam, therefore L f

Table A2 L f (T ent) equals 252.98 kilojoules per kilogram

ha: equals saturated liquid T out equals 100 degrees Celsius L f (T out) equals 419.07 kilojoules per kilogram

Q out equals m (ha - he) minus Q R equals minus 62182 kilojoules

When part of the liquid is incompressible, the volume is constant.  
Energy balance EW

Delta E equals m times (u2 minus u1) equals Q minus W, where W equals 0 because of constant volume.

u1 equals u (at T equals 0 degrees Celsius) plus x times (u (at T equals 0 degrees Celsius) minus u (at T equals 100 degrees Celsius))
equals minus 200.1 kilojoules per kilogram

u2 equals Q plus m times u (at T equals 1) divided by m
equals minus 185.1 kilojoules per kilogram

x (fluid) equals u2 minus u (at T1) divided by u (fluid) minus u (at T1)
equals 0.4848

T (at fluid) equals 0 degrees Celsius, constant!

x (at solid) equals m (at solid) divided by m equals 0.6

x (at liquid) equals 1 minus x (at solid) equals 0.4

x (at total) equals 1 minus x (at liquid) equals 0.552
