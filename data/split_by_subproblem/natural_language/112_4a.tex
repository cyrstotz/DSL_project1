The page contains diagrams and equations. 

1. A graph with axes labeled P and T. There is a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The region between points 2 and 3 is labeled "nachar".

2. Another graph with axes labeled P and T. The curve is divided into regions labeled "fest", "flüssig", and "gasförmig". There are points labeled 1, 2, and 3, with a shaded area marked as "i". The region between points 1 and 2 is labeled "sublim".

3. A small horizontal line labeled "gas" on the left side and "flüssig" on the right side.

4. A vertical line with points labeled 1 and 4.

5. A curve with points labeled 2, 3, and 4, with an arrow pointing from point 2 to point 3, labeled "sättigung".
