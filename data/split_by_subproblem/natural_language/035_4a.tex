The page contains two graphs.

The first graph has the y-axis labeled as 'p [bar]' and the x-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The graph shows a wavy line.

Below the graph, there are sequences labeled:
1-2: T increases, p decreases
2-3: S2 equals S3, p increases
3-4: isobar, T increases, p equals constant
4-1: isenthalpe, h4 equals h1, p decreases, T equals constant

The second graph has the y-axis labeled as 'p [bar]' and the x-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The graph shows a closed loop with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Between points 1 and 2, the label 'T equals constant' is present. Between points 3 and 4, the label 'p equals constant' is present.
