A graph is drawn with a labeled axis: the vertical axis is labeled 'p', and the horizontal axis is labeled 's'. The graph shows a cycle with points labeled O, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The curve starts at point O, moves to point 1, then to point 2, 3, 4, 5, and finally to point 6. There are two curves labeled p1 and p2.
