Energy balance stationary.

Zero equals m dot times (h in minus h out) plus Q dot out. Zero equals zero, no work. 

From TAB A-2, 

h in equals h f at seventy degrees Celsius equals two thousand three hundred thirty-seven kilojoules per kilogram, two hundred thirty-two point ninety-five kilojoules per kilogram. 

h out equals h g at two hundred degrees Celsius equals two thousand two hundred thirty-seven kilojoules per kilogram, four hundred forty-five point zero four kilojoules per kilogram.

Q dot in equals minus m dot times (h out minus h in). 

Q dot out equals zero minus m dot times (minus two thousand two hundred fifty-seven plus two thousand three hundred seventy-seven) kilojoules per kilogram equals twenty-three point zero four kilowatts.

Q dot out equals thirty-seven point eighty-two kilowatts.
