The page contains a graph with labeled points and curves. The vertical axis is labeled as 'T', and the horizontal axis is labeled as 's'. The graph includes the following points and labels:
- Point labeled '0' at the bottom left
- Point labeled '1' 
- Point labeled '2'
- Point labeled '3' at the top
- Point labeled '6'
- Point labeled '9'
- A curve labeled 'rev.' between points '0' and '1'
- A curve labeled '30 bar' between points '2' and '3'
- A curve labeled '50 bar' between points '3' and '9'
- A curve labeled '90' between points '6' and '9'

Below the graph, the following content is written:

b) Energy balance:
Q = m times (h_5 minus h_6 minus (u_5 squared minus u_6 squared) divided by 2 plus p V plus Q)

h_5 minus h_6 equals the integral from T_6 to T_5 of c_p dT minus c_p ln(T_5 over T_6)

v_5 over v_6 equals R times (T_5 over T_6) to the power of 1 over (gamma minus 1)

R equals c_p minus c_v

c_v equals c_p over gamma

R equals 0.28 times 52 times (m over kg) times (k over J)

For isentropic calculations:
T_6 equals T_s times (p_6 over p_s) to the power of (n minus 1) over n equals 526.634
