A graph is depicted with labeled points 0 through 6 along a curve. The axes are labeled with temperature in degrees Celsius on the vertical axis and entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The curve shows lines connecting points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with annotations p0, p1, p2, and p3. The graph includes the note "p0 = 0.191 bar" and a temperature of "-30°C" at the bottom of the vertical axis. The graph is labeled with various processes: "0 → 1 adiabatic expansion with p1/p0 < 1," "1 → 2 adiabatic pre-expansion," "2 → 3 isentropic compression," "3 → 4 adiabatic pre-heating," "4 → 5 mixing," and "5 → 6 adiabatic heating substitution at p3."
