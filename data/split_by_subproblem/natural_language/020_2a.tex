A graph is shown with the vertical axis labeled T (K) and the horizontal axis labeled S (kJ/kgK). The graph consists of a series of points connected by lines labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The segments between these points are labeled with terms such as "isentrop" and "adiabat". Specific points are marked with "P4 = P3" and "P4 = P5".
