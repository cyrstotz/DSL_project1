A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph includes several curves labeled as isobar, isentrop, and isochor. Points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the graph, with lines connecting them. The labels include p2 equals p3, p0 equals p6, and n is less than n isentrop. An additional label reads "p equals p0."

Negative two times open parenthesis h e minus h a close parenthesis equals omega e squared divided by omega a squared

omega a squared equals omega five squared plus two times c i three subscript p print open parenthesis T five minus T six close parenthesis

omega a equals square root omega five squared plus two times c i three subscript p print open parenthesis T five minus T six close parenthesis

equals two hundred twenty point four seven meters per second
