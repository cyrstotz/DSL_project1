A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes a curve labeled "Fl√ºssig" on the upper right side. There are three points labeled 1, 2, and 3 along the curve. Point 1 is connected vertically to point 2 by a line labeled "isobar". Point 2 is connected horizontally to point 3 by a line labeled "isotherm". The area between points 1 and 2 is labeled "i", and the area between points 2 and 3 is labeled "ii". The region below the curve is labeled "Fest". The region above the curve is labeled "Gas".
