Two horizontal lines intersecting, labeled 'zustand' and 'mGW', with numbers '2' and '0,014' at the intersection point.

mGW equals 0,014.

Q equals 0.

Energy balance:

dE divided by dt equals sum of Q dot minus sum of omega dot.

Cv equals 0,1633 kilojoules per kilogram-Kelvin.

Ice melts at 0 degrees Celsius, X EIS greater than zero.

T EW 2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.

T g2 equals 1 divided by 0 degrees Celsius.

Underlined note: Since not all ice is melted, the temperature above (and thus below) must be 0 degrees Celsius.

Ideal gas equation:

T2 divided by T1 equals (p2 divided by p1) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n, equals (T2 divided by T1) raised to the power of n divided by n minus 1, equals p2 divided by p1.

Cp equals R plus Cv equals 1,16612 kilojoules per kilogram-Kelvin, plus 0,633 kilojoules per kilogram-Kelvin equals 735,28 kilojoules per kilogram-Kelvin.

k equals Cp divided by Cv equals 4,187.

p1 equals p2 times (T2 divided by T1) raised to the power of n divided by n minus 1 equals 1,5 bar divided by (277,15 Kelvin divided by 500 plus 277,15 Kelvin) equals 0,9403 bar.
