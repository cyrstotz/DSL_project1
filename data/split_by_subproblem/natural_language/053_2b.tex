Ws equals 220 meters per second, Ps equals 0.8 bar, T5 equals 431.8 K, P6 equals 0.191 bar.

The equation is given as:
Q equals m dot gs times (h5 minus h6 plus c5 squared over 2 minus c6 squared over 2) minus W reversible.

A side note includes:
S5 equals S6 because isentropic.

The equations are:
T6 over T5 equals (P6 over P5) to the power of n minus 1 over n.

T6 equals T5 times (P6 over P5) to the power of n minus 1 over n equals 320.075 K (this result is underlined).
