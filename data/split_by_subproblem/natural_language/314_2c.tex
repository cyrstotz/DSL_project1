Delta subscript x subscript s subscript t subscript v subscript c equals m subscript v subscript g times (h subscript 0 minus h subscript c minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript c minus s subscript 0) plus w subscript c squared divided by 2 minus w subscript v subscript c squared divided by 2).

Equals m subscript v subscript g times (c subscript p times (T subscript 0 minus T subscript c) minus T subscript 0 times (c subscript p times ln (T subscript G divided by T subscript 0))) minus w subscript c squared divided by 2 minus w subscript v subscript c squared divided by 2.

m subscript v subscript g equals 15.100 in brackets kg divided by s divided by 200 meters.
