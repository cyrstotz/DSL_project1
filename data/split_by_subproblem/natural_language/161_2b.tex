Pg equals P3g. T3 equals T2g. EW is incompressible, the pressure in EW does not change with xew. The pressure in EW does not change, therefore the pressure in G3g also does not change. Pg equals P3g. No change in G3g. T3 equals T2g. T2g equals 0 because EW and G3g are in equilibrium. TEW2 equals T2g. TEW equals 0 degrees Celsius because TEW is zero or liquid, or it is a mixture of solid and liquid.
