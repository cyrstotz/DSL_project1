stationär: Q = 0, ω = 0

0 = ṁ (h5 - h6 + (w5 squared - w6 squared) / 2)

= ṁ cp (T5 - T6) + y5 w5 squared / 2 - y6 w6 squared / 2

w0 = square root of w5 squared + cp (T5 - T6)

An equation is written: 
ps V = m R T

ps V / s = R Ts

vs = R Ts / ps

R = Q / M

0.154 m = 286.85

T6 - T5 (p6 / ps) to the power of (k-1)/k = 831.94 (0.154 m / 0.5 bar) to the power of (k-1)/k = 328.07 K

w0 = square root of (270 m/s) squared + 1.006 J/g K (831.94 - 328.07 K) = 507.25 m/s

Additional notes include "adiabat + reversibel = isentrop" and "m1 = m = k = 1.4".
