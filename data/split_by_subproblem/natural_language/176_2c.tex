The following calculations are written:

T5 = 431,9 K
p5 = 0,1 bar
w5 = 220 meters cubed

Ideal trop 5-6: n = k = 1,4

T6/T5 = (p6/p5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n

T6 = T5 (p0/p5) raised to the power of 0,4 divided by 1,4

T6 = 431,9 K (0,194 bar / 0,1 bar) raised to the power of 0,4 divided by 1,4

T6 = 328,075 K

Additional calculations and equations:

o = m times (h5 minus h6) plus w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2 plus q minus w times n

h6 minus h5 = w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2

cp times (T0 minus T5) = w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2

w0 = 507,24 meters cubed

With cp = 1,006 kJ/kgK

T6 = 328,075 K

T5 = 431,9 K

w = 220 meters cubed

m dot j times delta ex j out equals m dot j times (h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0)) plus (w6 squared minus w0 squared) divided by 2 equals m dot j times cp0 times (T6 minus T0) minus T0 times (cp0 times (ln (T6 divided by T0))) plus (w6 squared minus w0 squared) divided by 2 equals m dot j times (1000 g divided by kg times (32 x 0.75 minus 2.43) times 1.5) minus 2.43 times 1.5 times (2000 g divided by kg times (50.7 divided by 2) squared minus (200 divided by 2) squared) equals m dot j times (120.73 times w0 divided by kg) implies delta ex j out equals 120.73 times w0 divided by kg.
