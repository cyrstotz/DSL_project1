Diagram 1:
A graph with the y-axis labeled p (mbar) and the x-axis labeled T (degrees Celsius). The graph includes lines labeled Eis, Wasser, and Dampf. The graph shows a curve starting from the point labeled Tripel and moving upwards towards Dampf. The pressure values indicated are 0.1, 1, and 10 mbar.

Diagram 2:
A graph with the y-axis labeled p (mbar) and the x-axis labeled T (degrees Celsius). The graph includes lines labeled Fl√ºssig, Tripel, and Isotherm. The pressure values indicated are 5 and 1 mbar. The graph shows a curve labeled Wasser Dampf starting from 0 degrees Celsius and moving upwards. Points labeled 1, 2, and 3 are marked along the curve.
