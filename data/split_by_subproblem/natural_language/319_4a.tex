Two graphs are drawn. The first graph shows a downward sloping line labeled 'p' and an upward sloping line labeled 'Tink'. The second graph shows a more complex plot with several lines and points labeled with various states: 'fest', 'fl√ºssig', 'gas', and annotations such as 'pin da p', 'geht hoch runter', 'wie in (*1) gezeigt', 'sauer', 'amber'. The axes are labeled 'Tink'.
