A graph is shown with a curve labeled from points 0 to 6. The x-axis is labeled as 's' in brackets with units '[kJ/kg K]'. There are three curves labeled as p0, p1, and p2. Points are marked on the graph as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

e sub x, str, zero equals minus open bracket c sub p times open parenthesis t zero minus t zero of s zero close parenthesis plus u c close bracket

equals minus 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram kelvin times open parenthesis 243.15 kelvin close parenthesis minus 243.15 kilojoules per kilogram times zero plus one half times open parenthesis 200 meters per second close parenthesis squared

e sub x, str, zero equals minus 19.755 kilojoules per kilogram

e sub x, str, zero minus e sub x, str, zero equals 85 kilojoules per kilogram

delta e sub x, str equals 85 kilojoules per kilogram
