W zero equals five point ten kilograms per second, T zero equals three hundred forty Kelvin.

Exergy balance around turbine, stationary, measurement: everything in brackets.

Delta Exergy stream equals negative bracket h zero minus h six minus T zero bracket s zero minus s six plus other exergy bracket zero. Other exergy equals w zero squared minus w six squared divided by two.

h zero minus h six equals Cp bracket T zero minus T six bracket equals negative ninety-seven point four three one kilojoules per kilogram.

s zero minus s six equals Cp ln bracket T zero divided by T six bracket equals negative zero point five three seven two seven kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

w zero squared minus w six squared divided by two equals negative one thousand zero fifty kilojoules per kilogram.

Delta Exergy stream equals negative two hundred seven point eight five kilojoules per kilogram.

Delta Exergy stream equals negative one hundred fifteen point seven four seven kilojoules per kilogram.
