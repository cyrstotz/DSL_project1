P3 equals P0 plus mg over A plus mEw times g over A equals one point four zero one times ten to the power of five pascal plus thirty-two point eight one over zero point zero zero seven eight five plus zero point four one times three point eight one over zero point zero zero seven eight five equals one thousand four hundred one point one four seven pascal equals seven point four zero seven bar.

A equals pi times r squared equals pi times zero point zero five meters squared equals zero point zero zero seven eight five meters squared.

mg times pV equals mRT. m equals p3 times V3 over RT. R equals eight point three one four over fifty times ten to the power of three equals one hundred sixty-six point two eight. m equals one point four zero one times ten to the power of five pascal times three point one four times ten to the power of negative three meters cubed over one hundred sixty-six point two eight minus seven hundred seventy-three point seven five k equals zero point zero zero three four two kilograms equals three point four two euros.
