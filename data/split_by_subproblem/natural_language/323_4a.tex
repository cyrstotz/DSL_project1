A graph is drawn with a vertical axis labeled 'p' and a horizontal axis labeled 'T'. The graph shows a cycle with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. There are lines connecting these points, with arrows indicating the direction of the cycle. The line from point 1 to point 2 is labeled 'Isotherm', from point 2 to point 3 is labeled 'Isentrop', from point 3 to point 4 is labeled 'Isochor', and from point 4 to point 1 is labeled 'Isobar'. At the bottom of the graph, there is a label 'ND'.
