Delta Q equals mg times Cp times delta T.

Delta Q equals 3.6 times omega squared times 0.8 times (T2 minus T1).

Equals 3.6 times omega squared times 0.8 times (0.003 degrees Celsius minus 500 degrees Celsius).

Equals negative 1.4393 joules.

Cp equals R divided by M plus Cv equals 8.314 kilograms divided by 50 kilograms divided by mole divided by Kelvin plus 0.033.

Cp equals 0.933 approximately equals 0.8 kilojoules divided by kilograms.
