Drawing of a diagram with arrows labeled as 'p1', 'p2', 'p3', 'p4', 'p5', 'p6', 'p7', 'p8', and 'p9'.

P0 plus Pmu plus PEW equals PJ.  
PEW equals m divided by A equals 0.1 divided by 0.006 equals 16.7 kilograms per square meter.  
A equals 0.05 sine 4 pi equals 0.0049 square meters.  
Pmu equals 32.9 divided by 0.008 equals 39.97 kilopascals.  
PJ equals 39.97 plus 100 plus 0.0127 equals 139.98 kilopascals equals P11 equals 1.39 bar.  
P0 equals 100 kilopascals.  

pV equals mRT implies m equals pV divided by RT equals 139.98 times 0.00634 times 50 divided by 8314 times 773.15 equals 0.1034 kilograms.  
Equals 3.42 grams equals mg.
