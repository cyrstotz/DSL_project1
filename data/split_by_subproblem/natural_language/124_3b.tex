Since x is greater than 0, in the equilibrium state not all the ice is melted, so the ice-water mixture is at equilibrium temperature equals 0 degrees Celsius. The break is in this case independent of the gas, rather it depends only on the mass of the water/ice, the weight, and the external pressure, which is constant without mass exchange.
