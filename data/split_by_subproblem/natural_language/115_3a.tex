P equation equals 7589.54 Pascal times 2.4 seconds

Delta U equation equals absolute value of U2 minus U1

Delta U equals C times delta T

U2 equals delta U divided by m plus U1

Delta U equals 7500 Joules

U equation table 1: U equation plus 0.6 times U equation minus U equation equals crossed out expression minus 0.05 plus 0.6 times negative 0.05 plus 33.458 equals negative 200.0568 squared minus U1

U2 equals 7500 divided by 6.714 plus negative 200.0568 times h divided by 9 equals negative 3000.852 squared divided by 14

x2 equals U2 minus U2 equation divided by U equation minus U equation
