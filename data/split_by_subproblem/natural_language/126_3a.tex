p sub s,1

Force equilibrium at the membrane: 
F sub g, F sub W, F sub p

p sub s,1

A equals (d divided by 2) squared times pi equals (0.04 meters divided by 2) squared times pi equals 0.7859 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters

p sub s,1 times A equals m sub e times g plus c times m sub e times g plus 10 to the power of 5 pascals times A

rho sub e equals 41.0 kilograms per cubic meter

m sub e equals rho sub e times V sub e equals 41.0 times 205.3 times 10 to the power of negative 3 divided by 0.166 times 10 to the power of negative 3 equals 0.1 kilograms

R sub e equals R divided by M equals 8.314 divided by 50 equals 0.166 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin
