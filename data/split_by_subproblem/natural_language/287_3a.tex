Area equals zero point zero five meters squared pi. 

Pressure subscript one equals thirty-two times nine point eight one plus zero point one times nine point eight one plus ten point five times zero point zero five pi plus thirty-two pi times zero point zero five pi divided by zero point zero five pi. 

Greater than or equal to one point four bar.

Mass subscript two equals pressure subscript two times volume subscript one divided by R times temperature. 

R equals R divided by molar mass equals eight point three one four joules divided by fifty meter squared kilogram. 

Mass subscript three equals fourteen point one five times three point one six times ten to the power of negative three divided by eighty-three divided by fifty divided by seventy-seven point one five equals zero point zero zero three nine kilograms equals three point nine grams.
