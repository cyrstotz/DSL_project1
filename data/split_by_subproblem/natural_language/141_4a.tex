A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes a curve labeled 'isotherpe' and a line labeled 'isentrope'. A point labeled '3' is marked on the curve, and another point labeled '2' is marked on the line. The pressure at these points is indicated as '8 bar'.
