An equation is written: 
Delta e underscore x st equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0) plus delta ke. 
Equals cp times (T6 minus T0) minus T0 times (cp times ln (T6 divided by T0)) minus R times ln (p6 divided by p0) plus delta ke. 
A calculation is shown: 
Equals 1.006 times (340 minus 243.75) minus 243.75 times (7.006 times ln (340 divided by 243.75)) plus 100.50 divided by 1000. 
Equals 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. 
Equals 125.47 kilojoules per kilogram. 
Another equation is present: 
delta ke equals w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2. 
Equals 570 minus 200 divided by 2. 
Equals 1100.50 Newton.
