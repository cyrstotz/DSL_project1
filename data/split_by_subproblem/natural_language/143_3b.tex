P sub g2 is approximately equal to P sub g1 equals 1.4 bar, as the same pressure from the atmosphere and weight still acts. Reibungsfrei, reibungsfrei und adiabatic, reversibel, ns k. k equals R plus C sub V over C sub V equals approximately 1.263. Poly tropic, T-verhalten. T sub g2 equals T sub g1 times (P sub 2 over P sub 1) to the power of k minus 1 over k equals 773.75 Kelvin.
