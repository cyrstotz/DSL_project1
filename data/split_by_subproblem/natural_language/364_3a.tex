A sub l equals pi times (d divided by 2) squared equals pi times (0.05 meters) squared equals 0.0078 square meters.

p equals F divided by A, therefore F equals pA.

p equals m divided by V, kg divided by m cubed.

F sub G equals F sub o plus F sub k plus F sub E.

p sub G1,1 equals p amb plus A sub l times m sub E times g plus m sub E times g.

p sub G1,1 equals p amb plus m sub E divided by A sub l times g plus 32 kg times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 0.0078 square meters equals 0.1 times 9.81 divided by 0.0078.

p sub G1,1 equals 1.3886 bar equals 1.4 bar.

pV equals mRT implies M sub g equals p sub G1,1 times V1 divided by R sub g times T1 equals p sub G1,1 times V1 divided by R divided by m times T1.

3 mol divided by kg times 1 mol divided by 3 g mol.

M sub g equals 3.42 g.
