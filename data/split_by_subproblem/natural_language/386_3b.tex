T g two equals T e w one equals 0 degrees Celsius

Because the ice does not melt completely, the temperature of the e w remains constant, and because the e w and gas are in equilibrium, they have the same temperature.

p g two equals p g one equals 1.1 bar, because the external load on the membrane does not change (same mass and same water pressure), the gas pressure remains constant.
