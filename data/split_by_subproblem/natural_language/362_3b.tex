Because x equals zero and T remains in the whole container, T one two must equal zero degrees Celsius at constant 1.1 bar.

In the two-phase region is p equals constant equals 1.1 bar, the temperature goes to zero degrees Celsius according to the table.

The pressure also remains constant, because p atm and m two equals constant.

Task 1  
m_water equals 0.1 kg.  
x_ice equals m_ice divided by m_water equals 0.6.  
T equals 0 degrees Celsius.  
Energy balance for ice water with Q_w equals 1082.14 J equals 7200 J.  
Delta U equals Q_w.  
W equals zero, because EP equals zero.  
U_1 equals x times (U_f(0 degrees Celsius) plus x times (U_g minus U_f)) times J times m_water.  
Equals 20 J.  
U_2 minus Q_w plus U_1 equals minus 18.35 kJ.  
x equals U_2 minus U_f divided by U_g minus U_f.  
U_1 equals 0.1 kg times (-333.458 plus x times (-0.1045 plus 333.458)) equals -13.3 kJ.  
U_2 equals U_1 plus Q_w equals -12.25 kJ.
