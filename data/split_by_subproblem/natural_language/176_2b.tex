A graph is drawn with axes labeled T [K] vertically and S [J/kgK] horizontally. The graph begins at point O, moves to point 2 with a label 'isotrope', then to point 3 labeled 'adiabate', then to point 4, and finally to point 5 labeled 'minima isotrope' and point 6 labeled 'Po/Ps'. The graph includes labels such as 'isotrope' and 'isobare', and the line from O to 2 is labeled 'Training'. The point O is labeled 243,47K.
