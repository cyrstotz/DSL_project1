P zero comma one m g

P zero comma one equals P zero plus F newton divided by A plus F newton A divided by A equals P zero plus (32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared plus 0.1 kilograms times 5.61 meters per second squared divided by Pi times (d divided by 2) squared)

P gas equals 11,000 square root of V gas divided by A equals 1.4 bar

PV equals mRT implies m gas equals P gas times V gas divided by R times T gas equals 1.4 bar times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 divided by 8.31 joules per mole kelvin times 773.15 kelvin

m gas equals 0.00342 kilograms equals 3.42 grams
