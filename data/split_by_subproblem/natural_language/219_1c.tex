Second law of thermodynamics, reactor:
Zero equals mass flow rate times (entropy out minus entropy in) plus heat transfer rate divided by temperature average equals heat transfer rate divided by temperature reactor plus entropy generation rate.

Second law illustrated.

Zero equals mass flow rate times (crossed out).
