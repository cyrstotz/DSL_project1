m g, p g squared

Kräfte ggü p squared D squared divided by four pi equals g (m ew plus m c) plus p amb D squared divided by four pi

p squared equals four divided by D squared pi g (m ew plus m c) plus p amb

equals four divided by (0.14 m squared) pi 9.81 m per second squared (0.12 kg plus 32 kg) plus 10 squared Pa

equals 1.40 bar

m g R T 2 equals p g 2 V g 2

m g equals p g 2 V g 2 divided by R T 2 equals 1.40 times 10 to the power of 5 Pa times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 2 m squared divided by 166.28 kg per m cubed times 273.15 K equals approximately 3.4 times 10 squared J divided by kg K

R equals R divided by m g equals 8.314 J divided by mol K divided by 50.10 squared kg divided by mol equals 166.28 J divided by kg K
