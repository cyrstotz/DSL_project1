Since the mass above the membrane remains constant, the pressure below must also remain constant, therefore p zero one equals p zero two equals one point four zero one bar.

First law of thermodynamics for the cylinder:
Delta E equals Q minus W equals Delta U.

Integral of W E Z equals p zero one times integral of d V equals p zero one times V two minus V zero equals U one minus U two equals C v times T one minus T two.
