The energy balance equation is set up as follows:

dE/dt = Σ mi (hi + ke + pe)i - Σ Qj - Σ Wn

There are notes indicating "da adiabatic" and "eine Schaufelstufe verrichtet keine Arbeit."

The equation for temperature ratio is given as:

T6/T5 = (pc/ps)^(n-1/n) => T6 = (pc/ps)^(n-1/n) * Ts = 0.7586 * 431.9K => T6 = 328.07K

The equation for energy is:

O = m dot gs [hs - hc + ws squared/2 - wc squared/2] - O

where hs = hc

hs - hc = cp (T5 - T6) * 1.006 kJ/kg K (431.9K - 328.07K) = 104.44825 kJ/kg

The velocity equation is:

wc squared/2 = hs - hc + ws squared/2

wc squared = 2 (hs - hc + ws squared/2)

wc = sqrt[2 (hs - hc + ws squared/2)] = sqrt[2 (104.448 + 4.498)] = 220.47 m/s
