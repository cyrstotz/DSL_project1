i zero five equals two hundred twenty joules.  
p five equals zero point five six five.  
T s equals forty-three point five K.  

Previous result conclusion:  
T G divided by T S equals (p six divided by p five) raised to the power of k minus one divided by k.  
T G equals three hundred twenty-eight point zero seven five K.  

Energy balance conclusion:  
d E divided by d t equals negative m times (h two minus h a plus w two squared minus w a squared divided by two) plus q squared plus w.  
m dot times W t equals one half v dot p plus delta a c u plus delta q squared.

b) Ice would be at 0°C because x equals less than 1 is

No heat exchange so T s2 equals 0°C because

otherwise a disturbance would occur.

The pressure p2 equals p1 equals 9.5 bar
