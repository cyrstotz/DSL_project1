Energy balance:
u equals m dot (h e minus h a minus w e squared divided by 2 minus w a squared divided by 2 plus g (z e minus z a)) plus Q minus V divided by t
Q, because volume change is not considered

q13 equals Q13 divided by m dot k

qB minus m dot k equals Q13 equals qB

m dot m divided by m dot k equals 5.293 minus 5.293 divided by 7 minus m dot k equals (5.293 divided by 7) times m dot k

T naught: p v equals R T implies p over R equals constant equals T over v

T naught equals T 5, as adiabatic process

T 4 over v 1 equals T 6 over v 6
