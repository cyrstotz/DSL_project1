System gas:
T gas 1 equals 500 degrees Celsius equals 773.15 Kelvin
p gas 1 equals 3.94 bar equals 3.94 times 10 to the power of 5 pascal
M equals 50 kilograms
C v equals 0.633 times R
Note: consider the gas perfect, it is isochoric, therefore
p gas 1 times V gas equals m times R times T gas 1

System ice-water mixture:
m ice equals 0.4 kilograms implies m ice equals m total
T ice 1 equals 0 degrees Celsius equals T equilibrium
x ice 1 equals 0.6 implies x ice equilibrium equals ?

Through the ice-water mixture:
p equilibrium 1 equals p atmosphere plus m gas times g divided by A equals 9.39 bar
implies p gas 1 equals p equilibrium 1 equals 9.39 bar
implies m gas times g equals p equilibrium 1 times V gas 1 minus m divided by R squared times T gas 1 equals 3.42 grams
