Energy balance around the nozzle:
0 = m dot times (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2)

h5 minus h6 (crossed out content)

w6 equals the square root of 2 times (h5 minus h6) plus w5 squared equals the square root of 2 times 104.5 times (431.9 divided by 0.5) plus (220 squared) equals 220.97 meters per second (crossed out content) equals 220.86 meters per second.
