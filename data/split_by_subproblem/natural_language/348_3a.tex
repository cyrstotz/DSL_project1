In equilibrium â†’ u-profile

Cross-sectional area = pi times r squared = seven point eight five times ten to the power of minus three cubic meters

Cylinder: r equals d divided by two

p equals F divided by A

p_s1 equals p_0 plus m dot g divided by A plus m_e dot w_s divided by A equals one point four bar

Perfect gas!

p times V equals m times R times T

m_s equals p_s1 times V_s1 divided by R times T equals three point four two nine

R equals R divided by M equals one six zero two eight joules per kilogram Kelvin 

five hundred fifty kilograms per cubic meter equals fifty times ten to the power of minus three kilograms per cubic meter
