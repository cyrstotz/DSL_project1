Diagram 1: 
- Graph with axes labeled T and S. 
- A curve with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 
- Annotations: 
  - 0: T equals 30 degrees, p0 equals 0.995 bar.
  - 0 to 1: p0 to p1.
  - 1 to 2: isentropic, p1 to p2.
  - 2 to 3: isobaric, T increases, p2 equals p3.
  - 3 to 4: isentropic, p4 increases.
  - 4 to 5: isobaric, p4 equals p5.
  - 5 to 6: isentropic, p6 equals p6.

Diagram 2:
