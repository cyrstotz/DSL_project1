Temperature average equals integral from entropy out to entropy in of temperature differential divided by entropy out minus entropy in equals heat transfer rate reversible divided by entropy out minus entropy in equals specific heat capacity times (temperature average out minus temperature average in) divided by specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of (temperature average out divided by temperature average in).

Equals two hundred thirty-three point one two Kelvin.
