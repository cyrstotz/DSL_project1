The page contains a graph with axes labeled as T (temperature) and s (entropy). The graph consists of a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, P1, P0, and P2. The curve starts at P0, goes through points 1, 2, 3, 4, and ends at P2. The temperatures T0 and T6 are noted as T0 equals 253.15 Kelvin and T6 equals 328.07 Kelvin.
