Variables and equations are presented:
- "W6, T6"
- "Ts = 431.3 K"
- "ps = 0.5 bar"
- "ws = 720 m/s"
- "pc = po = 0.151 bar"

An equation for isentropic processes is given:
- "isentrope Schubdüse: n = 3x = cp / cv"

Another equation:
- "T6 / Ts = (pc / ps) (x - 1 / 3x) => T6 = Ts (po / ps) (x - 1 / 3x) = 431.3 K (0.151 bar / 0.5 bar) ^ (0.9 / 1.4) ≈ 328.07 K"

An energy balance equation:
- "ΔE = 0 = dU + dH + dKE = q"

Further equations and calculations:
- "=> q = dKE => q = -dke"
- "dU = cv (T6 - Ts) = cp / cv (T6 - Ts)"
- "dke = 74.60 s = -dke"
- "=> ws = 10.4.45 ω^2 / 2"
- "=> ω = 5 ω^2 / 2"
- "dke = 74.60 s = -dke"

Another equation:
- "Δw = √2 74.60 s = 12.715 m/s"

Final calculation:
- "w6 = ws + ω = 332.2 15 m/s"
