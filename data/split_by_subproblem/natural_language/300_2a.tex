A graph is drawn with a vertical axis labeled T [K] and a horizontal axis labeled S [kJ/kg K]. The graph depicts a cycle with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The sections between points 2 and 3, and 4 and 5, are labeled as 'isobar'.

Zustand 0:
T0 equals negative 300 degrees Celsius.

Zustand 1:
adiabat
S1 is greater than S0, T1 is greater than T0.

Zustand 2:
adiabat, reversible
S2 equals S1, T2 is greater than T1.

Zustand 3:
isobar
T3 is greater than T2, S3 is much greater than S2.

Zustand 4:
T4 is less than T3, S4 is greater than S3, irreversible.

Zustand 5:
S5 is less than S4, T5 is not equal to T4.

Zustand 6:
S6 equals S5, T6 is less than T5.
