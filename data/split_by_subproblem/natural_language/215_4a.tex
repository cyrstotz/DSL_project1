A graph is drawn with axes labeled P and T. The graph shows a curve dividing the area into two regions labeled 'flüssig' and 'gasförmig'. There are two lines marked (i) and (ii). The line labeled (i) starts at the 'flüssig' region and moves vertically upwards, while the line labeled (ii) starts horizontally from the 'flüssig' region moving towards the 'gasförmig' region. The graph includes labels 'fest', 'smbar', and 'trick', and points T1 and T2 are marked on the horizontal axis.
