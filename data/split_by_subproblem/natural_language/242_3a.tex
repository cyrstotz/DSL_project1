PV equals mRT

P2 is greater than or equal to RT

R equals 854 joules per mole Kelvin divided by 30 kilograms per mole equals 166.28 joules per kilogram Kelvin

Lambda equals pi times (D divided by 2) squared equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters

Drall? Drall E2 is:

P equals mi divided by g times 6p divided by P equals

P equals mi divided by g plus p0 equals 1437.16,580 bar equals 1.44 bar

Drall gas:

[mi divided by g] P equals

Pg equals P plus mi divided by g equals 1.44 bar minus Pg1

=> m:

PV equals mRT

m equals PV divided by RT equals P1 V1 divided by R T1 equals 3.517 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms equals mg
