P_kr = F_kr / A  
A = (0.21 m / 2) squared times pi = 7.85 times 10 to the power of -3 m squared  
F_kr = 32 kg times 9.81 m/s squared  
P_kr = 0.4 bar  

P_tot = 1 bar + 0.4 bar = 1.4 bar = P_0,1  

m_B,1 = P_0,1 times V_1 / R times T_1 = 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 Pa times 3.14 times 10 to the power of -3 m cubed / 0.16629 kg m squared / s squared K times 773.15 K = 3.41 g  

R = 8.314 J / mol K / 50 kg / kmol > 0.16629 kg m squared / s squared K
