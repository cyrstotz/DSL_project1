A graph is drawn with several labeled points, connected by lines. The labels include numbers and letters:
- Point labeled as '0' at the bottom left.
- Point labeled as '1' above point '0'.
- Point labeled as '2' to the left of point '1'.
- Point labeled as '3' above point '2' with an arrow pointing to 'P2'.
- Point labeled as '4' to the right of point '3' with an arrow pointing to 'P5'.
- Point labeled as '5' below point '4'.
- Point labeled as '6' below point '5' with an arrow pointing to 'P0'.
The graph has the label 'isobare' written in blue above the line connecting points '2' and '3'. On the horizontal axis, there is an arrow pointing right labeled 'S' with '[h3 hq k]' written below it.
