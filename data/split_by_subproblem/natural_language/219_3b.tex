TEW2 equals TS2  

Equals zero degrees Celsius  

V3 plus over VS1 minus over MG equals one point two three six two cubic meters per kilogram  

p32 equals pS1  

Equals one point zero four zero one bar  

This applies because thermodynamic equilibrium exists  

Since the weight force and external pressure do not change
