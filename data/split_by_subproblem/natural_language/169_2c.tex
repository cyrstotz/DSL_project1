Q equals m dot divided by 2 (h6 minus h0) plus (w2 squared minus w0 squared) divided by 2.
Arrow: (w2 squared minus w0 squared) divided by 2 equals h0 minus h6.
Arrow: w6 equals the square root of 2 times (h0 minus h6) plus w2 squared.
h0 minus h6 equals the integral from T6 to T0 of cp dT equals cp (T0 minus T6) equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (30 plus 273.15) K.
Equals 293.91 K approximately equals crossed-out text minus 50.76 kilojoules per kilogram.
Arrow: w6 equals crossed-out text equals the square root of 2 times (minus 50.76) plus 200 squared equals 200.25 meters per second.
T6 equals T5 times (p6 divided by p5) to the power of (k minus 1) divided by k.
Equals 431.9 K divided by 0.191 divided by 0.5 to the power of 1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4.
Equals 293.91 K.
Absolute value of p6 equals p0.
