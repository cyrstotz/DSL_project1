c p equals R plus c v equals 799.28 joules per kilogram Kelvin

c p m g T g1 plus 0.6 times m E W

c p over c v equals n equals 1.26

The pressure remains constant from 1 to 2. p g12 equals 1.4 bar

The temperature T g12 of the gas will be just above 0 degrees Celsius, as further ice is present, and the E W has a temperature of approximately 0 degrees Celsius.
