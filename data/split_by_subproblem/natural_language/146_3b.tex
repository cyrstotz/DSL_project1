X greater than 0

T zero comma one squared question mark, T gas question mark

Delta E gas equals Delta E EW implies Delta E gas minus Delta E EW equals 0

Delta E gas minus Delta U equals m gas times c V times (T two minus T one)

Delta E EW equals Delta U equals m EW times (T two minus T one) m EW times (u two minus u one)
