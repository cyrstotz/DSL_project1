Energy at the power plant

a) T

A graph is drawn with axes labeled, showing a curve with points marked. The labels include:
- Isentropic
- Isobaric
- Isothermal
- T greater than T a
- S f greater than S i

0 to 1 is isentropic, T i
1 to 2 is isentropic, T i
2 to 3 is isobaric, T i
3 to 4 is irreversible turbine
4 to 5 is isobaric
5 to 6 is isothermal

5 [1/kg]

Sorry, German salad in my head, I mean isentropic.

b) To determine T c:
Air equals ideal gas
P c times V c equals R times T c

R air equals 8.314 divided by M air equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole Kelvin divided by 28.97 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms per mole equals 287 joules per kilogram Kelvin

5 to 6 is isentropic
S f equals S i

T 5 equals 80
P equals 0.5 times 10 to the power of 5 pascal, plus 31.9 Kelvin equals Table A-22
