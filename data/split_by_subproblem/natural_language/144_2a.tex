A graph is drawn with axes labeled T in brackets K and S in brackets kJ divided by kg. The graph consists of a curve with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There are dashed lines connecting points 2 and 3, and 5 and 6, with a label of 0.5 bar next to the dashed line from 2 to 3. The label P2 equals P3 is written above the dashed line connecting 2 and 3.
