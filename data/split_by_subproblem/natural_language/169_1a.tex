a) Energy balance stationary:  
Zero equals dot m inlet times h inlet minus h outlet plus Q dot outlet  
implies Q dot outlet equals dot m times h outlet minus h inlet  
equals dot m times (h outlet minus h inlet)  
Zero, since isobaric  

h outlet minus h inlet equals integral from T1 to T2 of c if dT plus v if times (p2 minus p1)

b) T average equals integral from s a to s e of T ds divided by s a minus s e  
equals 288.15 plus 298.15 Kelvin divided by 2  
approximately equals 293.15 Kelvin  

c) Entropy balance stationary:  
Zero equals dot m times (s e minus s a) plus Q dot outlet divided by T average plus S dot generation  
S dot generation equals dot m times (s a minus s e) minus Q dot outlet divided by T average plus Q dot R divided by T outlet  

s a minus s e equals integral from T1 to T2 of c times 1 over T dT equals c times ln (T2 over T1)  
equals c times ln (298.15 over 288.15)
