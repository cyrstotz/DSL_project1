A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 's' with units 'kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin' and the y-axis labeled as 'T'. The graph includes the following points labeled numerically: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. There are two processes labeled on the graph: 'isobar' and 'isentrop'. The graph includes arrows indicating the direction of the processes. There is a zigzag line between points 1 and 2, and a curved line between points 5 and 6.
