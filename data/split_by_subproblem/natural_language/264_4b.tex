The following calculations and notes are present:

- Question: ṁ_R134a?
- Notation: 1HS
- Equation: O = ṁ[h_2 - h_3] + Q̇ - Ẇ_u
- Further expression: Ẇ_u / (h_2 - h_3) = ṁ_R134a
- Arrow pointing to the equation: Ẇ_u = 28W
- Temperature information: T_i = -10°C = 263.15K
- h_3 = h_f = 264.15 kJ/kg (noted as 'Tabelle A-11')
- Note: 'wir wissen s_2 = s_3'
- Additional expression: Ẇ_u = C_p(T_2 - T_3)
- Temperature: T_3 = 31.33°C
- T_2 = (left blank for further calculation)
