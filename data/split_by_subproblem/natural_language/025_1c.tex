Speed regulation of a turbine class

O equals m dot times h5 plus w6 squared divided by two minus w6 squared divided by two

T5 equals 458.75

T6 equals?

T6 equals TS equals TS times P6 divided by P5 to the power of k minus one divided by k equals 328.04 Kelvin

h5 minus h6 equals cp times T5 minus T6 equals 104.4533 kilojoules per kilogram

h6 equals h5 minus 104.4533 kilojoules per kilogram

m dot equals 104.4533 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 1.2 plus 104.4533 times 10 to the power of 3 divided by 0.8 times 10 to the power of 3 times 2 times 60 divided by 1

equals 0.8 times w6 squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2 divided by 32

equals 0.8 times w6 squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2 divided by 32 equals 502.253 meters squared
