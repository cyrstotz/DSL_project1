T two, T six?
T two over T one equals P two over P one to the power of n minus n over n minus one equals V one over V two to the power of n minus one.
P e over P s to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 equals omega s over omega e to the power of 0.9.
Zero point one nine bar over zero point five bar equals two hundred twenty meters per second over omega e to the power of 0.7.
Therefore, omega e equals four hundred thirty-seven point four seven meters per second.

T e equals T s times P e over P s to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 equals four hundred thirty-one point four five Kelvin.
Zero point one nine over zero point five to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 equals three hundred twenty-six point zero seven five Kelvin.

n equals one point four.
