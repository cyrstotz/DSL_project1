T mean equals integral from s one to s two of T ds divided by s two minus s one.

s two prime minus s e equals integral from T one to T two of c p of T dT equals c p at T mean times ln of T two over T one.

T ds equals 0.41 minus V times dp equals 0, as pressure is constant.

Integral of T ds equals 0.41 equals c p times e to the power of zero times dT times V times p divided by c p equals c p times (T two minus T one).

T mean equals 288.15 minus 238.15 divided by ln of T two over T one equals 238.15 divided by ln of 238.15 divided by 288.15 equals 293.12 Kelvin.
