m times k divided by A times s plus m times e divided by A times s squared plus p sub zero equals p sub s1.  
A equals pi times D squared divided by four.  
p sub s equals p sub zero plus three divided by A times m times k times m times e divided by s equals 760 d.  
p sub s1 equals 1.401 bar.  
m sub s equals rho times V divided by R times T equals p sub s1 divided by R times T times V sub s1 times m sub s equals 1.401 bar times 3.14 times 10 cubed divided by 9.81 times g divided by m times V divided by 50 divided by 101 times 3 divided by pi.  
m sub s equals 3.42 g.
