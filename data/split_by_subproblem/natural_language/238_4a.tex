A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the y-axis labeled as 'P [Pa]'. There is a curve labeled 'Nassdampfgebiet' which intersects with two diagonal lines.

The page contains two graphs related to thermodynamics.

The first graph is labeled with "a)" and has axes labeled as follows: the vertical axis is labeled "P [Pa]" and the horizontal axis is labeled "T [K]". The graph shows two intersecting lines. One line is labeled "Tripel" with a point marked as "2" on the curve.

The second graph has the vertical axis labeled "P [Pa]" and the horizontal axis labeled "T [K]". It features a closed loop with points marked as "1", "2", "3", and "4". The path from point "4" to "1" is labeled "isobar", and the path from "1" to "2" is labeled "isochor". The loop appears to represent a thermodynamic cycle.
