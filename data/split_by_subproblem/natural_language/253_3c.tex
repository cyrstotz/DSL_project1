First law of thermodynamics for a closed system  
Delta U one two equals Q one two minus W one two  
m two C v (T two g minus T one g) equals Q one two minus W one two  

W one two equals integral from one to two of p dV  
equals R (T two g minus T one g)  
equals negative 83.14 kJ  

Therefore, Q one two equals m two C v (T two g minus T one g) minus 83.14 kJ  
equals negative 82 kJ
