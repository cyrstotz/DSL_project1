The text indicates "st. for mit massenstrom" and an equation is written as follows: 
O equals m underscore ges times (h5 minus h4) plus (w5 squared minus w4 squared divided by 2) plus Q dot minus W dot e. 
There is a note mentioning 1st sum Bk. 
Another equation is written: 
O equals m underscore k times (h2 minus h3) plus Q dot minus W dot O. 
O equals m underscore k times (cp times (T2 minus T3)) plus Q dot divided by m dot k. 
O equals m underscore ges times (cp times (T1 minus T6)) plus (w2 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2). 
There is a note indicating m underscore ges equals m underscore k plus m underscore m. 
Additional equations and notes are present: 
pV equals mRT. 
S equals z equals S1. 
T2 divided by T1 equals (p2 divided by p1) to the power of k minus 1 divided by k. 
P2 equals P3. 
T6 divided by T1 equals pV divided by RT. 
k equals cp divided by cv. 
cv equals cp divided by k. 
R equals cp minus cv. 
Equals cp minus cp divided by k. 
Equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin divided by 1.4. 
Equals 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
