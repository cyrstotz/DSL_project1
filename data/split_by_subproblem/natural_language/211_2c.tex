The equation is crossed out: Delta e ex, skr equals Delta e ex, skr.

Delta e ex, skr equals h 6 minus h 0 minus T 0 (s 6 minus s 0) plus p 0 (V 6 minus V 0).

equals c p (T 6 minus T 0) minus T 0 (c p ln (T 6 divided by T 0)) plus p 0 (V 6 minus V 0).

V 6 equals R T 0 divided by p 0 equals R divided by M p 0.

R equals 340 K divided by 28.97 g divided by mol equals 0.314 10 to the power of 3 Pa equals 5.109 times 10 to the power of 3 m cubed divided by kg.

V 0 equals R divided by M T 0 divided by p 0 equals 28.97 g divided by mol times 0.314 10 to the power of 3 Pa equals 5.109 times 10 to the power of 3 m cubed divided by kg.

Delta e ex, skr equals 1.006 kJ divided by kg equals (340.0 minus 273.15) K minus 273.15 K times (1.006 kJ divided by kg times K ln (340 K divided by 273.15 K) plus 0.314 times 10 to the power of 3 Pa (V 6 minus V 0)).
