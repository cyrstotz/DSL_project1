The page contains two diagrams labeled "Aufgabe 2". 

The first diagram is a graph with the title "T (°C)" at the top. It includes several labeled points and curves. The points are labeled "Brennkammer", "Turbine", "Schubdüse = SL", and "0,197 bar". Lines connect these points in a triangular fashion. There are annotations like "Hochdruckverdichter", "verdichter", "kompression", "vorkverdichter", "isentrop", "verdichter 2", and "Brennkammer Turbine". The x-axis is labeled "S (kJ/kgK)". The y-axis is labeled "T (°C)".

The second diagram is another graph with similar labels. It includes points labeled "Brennkammer", "Turbine", "Mischkammer", "Schubdüse", "verdichter", "vorkverdichter", and "vorverdichter". The points are numbered from 0 to 6 and connected in a polygonal shape. There are annotations such as "isobare", "adiabat", and "kompression". The x-axis is labeled "S (kJ/kgK)" and the y-axis is labeled "T (°C)".
