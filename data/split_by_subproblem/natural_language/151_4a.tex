A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'p' and the x-axis labeled as 'T' in degrees Celsius. The y-axis has values marked as 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01, and the x-axis has values marked from -50 to 10 in increments of 10. The graph depicts a curve labeled 'isotherm' with regions labeled 'fl√ºssig' and 'gas'. Several points are marked on the graph: '1', '2', '3', 'GK', and 'ist'. Lines are drawn between these points, labeled as 'isobar' and 'isotherm'. The region between points '1' and '2' is shaded.
