P sub g1 equals question mark squared
n sub g1 equals question mark squared
P sub g1 equals P sub 0 plus n total g divided by m times A
A equals pi times j sub 1 equals D divided by 2 times j sub 1 equals 0.00785398 meters squared
n total equals n sub k plus n sub e equals 32.71 grams
P sub g1 equals 1.40094 bar
n sub g equals P times V divided by R times T
R equals B divided by M equals 166.28 grams per mole
n sub g equals 3.422 grams
