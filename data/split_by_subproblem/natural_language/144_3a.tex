A equals (d divided by 2) squared times pi equals 0.00785 meters squared.  
PK equals m times g divided by A equals 39990 Pascal equals 33.35 kilopascal.  
PEW approximately equals 6.108 kilopascal from Table A-6.  
PG plus PEW equals PK plus Pamb.  
Therefore, PG equals PK plus Pamb minus PEW equals 1.394 bar.
