The temperature would continue to fall while the pressure remains constant. Therefore, it would enter the wet steam region.

m with a dot over it equals m dot 134a.

Temperature in the evaporator: T_i = G_k

Titus Diagram = -10째C, T_f = -18째C

From x_2 = n, one finds the entropy and enthalpy from Table A-10.

s_g (-18째C) = 0.5298 kilojoules per kilogram kelvin

h_g (-18째C) = 237.74 kilojoules per kilogram kelvin

Since the compressor is adiabatically reversible, it follows that

s_2 = s_3
