x ice, 2 in state 2

For this, we need the formula

U minus U solid divided by U liquid minus U solid equals x ice, 2

Our U equals U divided by mass flow equals Q divided by mass flow

equals 1082 minus 1.08 multiplied by 20060777 divided by 0.1 kilogram

equals 10.82 kilojoule per kilogram

Since we are not completely liquid, we take the temperature of 0 degrees Celsius from the table

U solid equals minus 333.458 kilojoule per kilogram, U liquid equals minus 0.645 kilojoule per kilogram

Insert

Parenthesis 10.82 minus minus 333.458 end parenthesis kilojoule per kilogram divided by parenthesis minus 0.645 kilojoule per kilogram minus minus 333.458 kilojoule per kilogram end parenthesis equals 1.032

Therefore, x ice, 2 equals 1.032
