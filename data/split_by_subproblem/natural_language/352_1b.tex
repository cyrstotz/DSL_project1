T equals q rev over s two minus s one equals h two minus h one over s two minus s one equals T two minus T one over ln of T two over T one equals two hundred thirty-eight point one five minus two hundred eighty-six point one five over ln of two hundred fifty-eight point one six over two hundred ninety-three point one six equals two hundred ninety-three point one Kelvin.

delta S equals S two minus S four equals m two S two minus m four S four  

S two equals S f (30 degrees Celsius, table A-7) equals 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram kelvin  

S f (100 degrees Celsius) plus x times (S g (100 degrees Celsius) minus S f (100 degrees Celsius)) approximately 1.339 kilojoules per kilogram kelvin  

delta S equals (5355 plus 109) times 0.9549 minus 5355 times 1.339  

approximately 2095 kilojoules per kilogram
