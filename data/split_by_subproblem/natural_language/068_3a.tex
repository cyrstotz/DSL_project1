FDD:

p1 = pAtmos + pK + pEW = pAtmos + g1 (mK + mEW) divided by (pi times D squared)

[Diagram of a cylinder labeled with FAtmos, PK, EW, FPK, g1, FAtmos, FEW]

pK = mK times g1 divided by (pi times D squared divided by 4) and pEW = mEW times g1 divided by (pi times D squared divided by 4)

=> p1 = 20 to the power of 5 N divided by m squared + 9.82 times (1.32 + 0.2) kg times g1 divided by (pi times 0.1 m squared) = 1,401.28 N divided by m squared > 3401 bar

o.g. Ideal gas state equation:

pG1,2 times vG1,2 = Rg times Tg1,2 => vG1,2 = Rg times Tg1,2 divided by pG1,2 from the piston model

=> mG = vG1,2 times pG1,2 divided by Rg times 1 divided by Tg1,2 = vG1,2 times pG1,2 times Rg divided by R minus Tg1,2 = 3.14 times 10 to the power of -3 m cubed times 1.5 times 10 to the power of 5 N divided by m squared divided by 8.314 J divided by mol times K times (500 + 273.15) K

=> mG = 3.664 g
