A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled as T in brackets K and the horizontal axis labeled as S in brackets kg over kg times K. The graph consists of a curve that starts at point two, rises to point three, falls to point four, and rises again to point five, ending at point six. The curve is marked as 'isobar' going through point three and 'isobar' again near point five.
