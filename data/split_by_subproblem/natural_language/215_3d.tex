Exergibil: calculate with 100 kilojoules per kilogram further for Delta exstr

exel equals minus Delta exstr plus (1 minus T0 divided by T) times Q dot

T0 equals 243.15 Kelvin  
T equals 1289 Kelvin

Attention it is only transferred to the heat Q dot

exel equals minus Delta exstr plus (1 minus T0 divided by T) times Q dot divided by 1 plus 5.293

exel equals 54.073

EK equals Qzu over WK from energy balance around refrigeration cycle:

28 watts 

Qzu equals m dot (h2 minus h1)
