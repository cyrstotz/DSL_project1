A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as T and the x-axis labeled as S with units in brackets as [u over kg u]. The graph shows a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The line connecting points 2 and 3 is labeled 'Isobare 2, 3' and the line connecting points 4 and 5 is labeled 'Isobare 4, 5'. The lines connecting points 1, 2, 5, and 4 are labeled 's = const'.
