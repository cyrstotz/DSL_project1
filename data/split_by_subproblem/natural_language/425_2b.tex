Energy balance at the nozzle:
Ws equals two hundred twenty meters squared per second squared.
Ps equals zero point five bar.
Ts equals four hundred thirty-one point three Kelvin.
ms equals m dot compressor.
Po equals zero point one nine bar.
Tc equals To equals negative thirty degrees Celsius equals two hundred ninety-three point one five Kelvin.

Q dot equals m dot times the quantity hs minus h1 plus the quantity ws squared minus w1 squared divided by two minus Wt,s1.

V5 equals RTs divided by Ps5.

wt,s6 equals the integral from vdp plus ske equals negative RTs times the natural logarithm of the quantity P6 divided by Ps5 plus the quantity w6 squared minus w5 squared divided by two.

Q dot equals hs minus h6 plus ws squared.
