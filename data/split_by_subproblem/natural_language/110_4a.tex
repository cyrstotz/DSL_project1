The page contains a graph with pressure (p) on the y-axis labeled in bar and temperature (T) on the x-axis labeled in degrees Celsius. The graph has three regions labeled "fl√ºssig" (liquid), "fest" (solid), and "gas" (gas). There is a line labeled "Tripel" (triple) point. The graph also has a line labeled "p2 = 8 bar".

Below the graph, the following text is written:
T_i = solid to liquid
x = 0 liquid = vapor
x = 1 p <= solid?
