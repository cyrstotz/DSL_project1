Q̇_out = ?

0 = ṁ[h_e - h_c] + Σ Q̇_i

ln[h_a - h_e] - Q̇_R = Q̇_out = 0.3 log[h_2 - h_n] - 100 kW

h_avg^A-2 = 2626.8 kJ/kg, h_2g^A-2 = 2676.4 kJ/kg, h_f,t = 252.9 kJ/kg, h_2g = 419.04 kJ/kg

h_n = 304.65 kJ/kg, h_2 = 436.33 kJ/kg

Q̇_out = -62.3 kW

u) i)

a) Diagram with labeled axes: 
- The vertical axis is labeled 'p [bar]'.
- The horizontal axis is labeled 'T [k]'.
The diagram includes a curve with the following labels at different points:
- 'Triple point'
- 'Flüssig'
- 'Verdamp'
- 'Dampf'

b) W dot K equals twenty-eight W

Two isentropic three

Zero equals m dot [h e minus h three] minus W dot K, leads to W dot K equals m dot [h two minus h three]

Leads to m dot equals W dot K divided by [h one minus h three]

h two equals

p three equals p bar, h two, A x x O

S two equals S three leads to S three equals

c) x A equals question mark

x A equals h n minus h n f divided by h n g minus h n f
