T0 equals 263.15 K  
P0 equals 0.197 bar  
ṁ min equals 5.293 ṁ k  
Cp equals 1.006 J per kg K  
k equals 1.4

a)  
Graph with T in K on the y-axis and s in J per kg K on the x-axis. Points labeled 1 through 6 with arrows indicating direction. The line labeled P0.

Graph with T in K on the y-axis and s in J per kg K on the x-axis. Points labeled 2 through 6 with arrows indicating direction. The line labeled 0.5 bar.

b)  
Equation: dE/dt equals ṁ gas (h5 minus h6) plus (w5 squared over 2 minus xe squared over 2)

TB equals T0 times (P0 over P5) to the power of (k minus 1) over k equals 328.07 K

Equation: dE/dt equals ṁ gas (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared over 2 minus w6 squared over 2) plus xe squared over 2 minus xe squared over 2

Equation: square root of (w5 squared over 2 minus (h6 minus h5)) equals w6 equals 507.25 m per s

hB minus h5 equals Cp delta T
