P one one, m two, m two is equal to V over R T, R equals R bar equals 166.3.  
P one one equals F G over A plus P zero equals 140094 pascals times 1.42 meters.  
F G equals (m K plus m E N) times g.  
A equals (0.05 meters squared) pi equals 10.00785 meters squared.  
m two equals 140094 pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 meters cubed over 83.14 joules per mole times (293.25 plus 500) Kelvin equals 3.422 grams.
