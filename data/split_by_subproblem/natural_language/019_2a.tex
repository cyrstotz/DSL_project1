b) 

Searched: ws, T6

Given: ws, T5, P5, P6

From the task description:

Nozzle is reversible → S nozzle equals zero

Nozzle is adiabatic → Q dot equals zero

→ Isentropic

Entropy relation with K:

T6 over T5 equals (P6 over P5) to the power of 0.4

→ T6 equals T5 times (P6 over P5) to the power of 0.4 over 1.4

equals 328.1 K

ws squared equals h5 minus h6 plus ws squared minus w6 squared over 2 plus B dot over m dot

equals h5 minus h6 plus ws squared over 2 minus w6 squared over 2

ws squared equals square root of 2 times (h5 minus h6) plus ws squared over m

equals square root of 2 times cp times (T5 minus T6) plus ws squared

equals 507.2 m over s

kJ over kg equals K plus m squared over 2

kW over m equals kJ over kg plus m squared over 2

(kJ over kg) equals log m squared plus m over kg
