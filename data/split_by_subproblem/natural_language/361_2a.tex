A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the y-axis and entropy (s) on the x-axis. The graph includes a cycle labeled with points 1, 2, 3, and 6. There is a line labeled "isobare" connecting points 3 and 6. The graph includes lines indicating processes between these points, with arrows showing direction. 

Below the graph:
- T0 equals negative 38 degrees Celsius.
- rho equals 0.191.
- P1 is greater than P0.
- P equals 7 P0.

Q equals m times (u2 minus u1)

u2 equals Q divided by m plus u1 equals 7.5 divided by 0.1 equals minus 133.41 equals minus 75.91 kilojoules per kilogram

u1 equals u test plus x times (u2 minus u test) equals minus 133.91 kilojoules per kilogram

u2 equals u test plus x times (u2 minus u test) therefore x equals u2 minus u test divided by u2 minus u test equals minus 178.44 plus 335.442 divided by minus 9.083 plus 335.442 equals 0.645

0.003 degrees Celsius
