The formula O equals m dot R-134a times (h2 minus h1) plus Q dot minus W dot is written. 

m dot R-134a equals negative W dot divided by h2 minus h3.

h2 is found using a table, A-10 LERP with y2 minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1 times (x minus x1) plus y1. Specific values are given: (-8, 242.54) and (-1, 249.50).

h2 equals 243.72 L/s.

An equation for x is shown: x equals h2 minus hf divided by hg minus hf, leading to x equals LERP hfg 42.445, hfg. An arrow points to the next page with the note "n√§chste Seite" (next page).
