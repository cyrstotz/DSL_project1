a) Stationary without losses

Zero equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy in minus enthalpy out) plus heat transfer rate plus heat loss rate

Heat loss rate equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy out minus enthalpy in) minus heat transfer rate

Heat loss rate equals two point sixty-two kilowatts minus one hundred twenty-three point zero four kilowatts

Enthalpy in h_fs (70 degrees) equals two thousand three hundred thirty-three point eight kilojoules per kilogram

Enthalpy out h_fs (1000 degrees) equals two thousand five hundred seventy-six point one kilojoules per kilogram

Enthalpy out equals two hundred fifty-seven point zero

b) S_erz plus mass flow rate (s_e minus s_a) plus sum of heat transfer rate divided by temperature equals zero

S_erz equals zero

Heat loss rate divided by heat loss rate equals one divided by temperature

T bar equals c (T_2 minus T_1) equals (heat loss rate) divided by ln(T_2 divided by T_1) equals approximately three point twelve Kelvin

c) S_erz equals mass flow rate (enthalpy out minus enthalpy in) divided by temperature plus heat transfer rate divided by temperature

S_a equals (seven point three zero five minus one point three zero six) kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times two hundred twenty-five point zero plus one point three zero six kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin equals seven point three five four seven kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin

S_a equals zero point zero five c times (seven point seven five five minus zero point eight five zero) kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin divided by (twenty-six point two six eight minus two hundred fifty-two point three eight) kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times two thousand three hundred thirty-three point eight plus zero point five two five equals seven point seven five six two kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin

Equals zero point two zero two six eight

Twenty-six point six kilojoules per kilogram

Delta U equals Q in plus 5 m12 U

m12 equals Q in over U12 times m dot times U2 minus U1 over U12

U1 equals Uf minus omega times (Ug minus Uf) 100 degrees equals 40.15 kilojoules per kilogram

U12 equals Uf plus x times (Ug minus Uf) equals 2333.33 kilojoules per kilogram

x12 equals omega times hf minus hf plus hg equals 0.03

Delta S12 equals m dot times (
