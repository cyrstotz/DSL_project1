A diagram is drawn with axes labeled 'T/K' for the vertical axis and 's' for the horizontal axis. Various points labeled '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6' are marked, with lines connecting them. A curve labeled 'p zero' is shown, along with another curve labeled 'p two, three' and 'p four, five'.

O equals negative delta e sub x, str plus open parenthesis one minus T sub o over T close parenthesis times q dot minus w sub c minus e sub x, vel
