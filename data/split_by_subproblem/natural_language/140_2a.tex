A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled 'T [K]' and the horizontal axis labeled 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]'. The graph depicts a cycle with points labeled O, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Lines connect these points, forming a closed loop. The line between points 1 and 2 is labeled 'P1 = P5', the line between points 2 and 3 is labeled 'P2 = P3', and the line between points 0 and 6 is labeled 'P0 = P6'. There is a dashed line labeled 'PA' connecting points 1 and 4.
