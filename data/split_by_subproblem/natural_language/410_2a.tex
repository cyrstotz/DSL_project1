A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled T [K] and the horizontal axis labeled S [kJ]. The graph shows a curve with five points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The path from point 1 to point 3 is labeled isentrop. The path from point 4 to point 5 is labeled isentrop. Point 4 is annotated with 'konstant p2, p4'.
