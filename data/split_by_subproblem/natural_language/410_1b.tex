Average temperature equals integral from entropy in to entropy out of temperature differential entropy.

Ideal fluid state: Entropy in minus entropy out equals integral from temperature in to temperature out of specific heat capacity differential temperature.

PKF, actual equals PKF, theoretical implies isothermal plus adiabatic equals reversible isentropic.

Average temperature equals temperature in plus temperature out divided by two equals 293.15 Kelvin.
