w sub c and T sub c:
T sub c equals (P sub 2 divided by P sub A) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n times T sub s equals 328.075 Kelvin

u sub c equals the square root of v sub 6 divided by v sub 5 equals 437.427 meters per second

v sub s equals R times T sub 5 divided by P sub 5 equals 0.00248

R equals C sub p minus C sub v equals 0.2874

k equals C sub p divided by C sub v equals C sub p divided by k equals 0.749

V sub G equals R times T sub c divided by P sub 6 equals 0.0049 kilograms per cubic meter
