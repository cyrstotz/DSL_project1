Internal energy of the gas:

Delta U equals m times u two minus m times u one  
equals m times u two minus u one  
equals m times c sub u times (T two minus T one)  
equals 0.002993 kilograms times 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram times Kelvin times (0.002933 times 273.15 minus (500 plus 273.15 Kelvin))  
equals minus 0.927 joules

W sub u one two equals m times integral from one to two of p times du  
n equals c sub p divided by c sub u equals R plus c sub u divided by c sub u  
equals 1.263

W sub u one two equals m times integral from one to two of R times (T two minus T one) divided by 1 minus n  
equals 0.926 joules

m dot times (h two minus h one) equals zero  
implies h two equals h one  
implies h two equals h one from table A dash 11  
T two equals T one
