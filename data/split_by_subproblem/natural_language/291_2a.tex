Isobare Einheiten p6 = p0

A graph is depicted with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 's [k/kgK]'. The graph shows a series of points and lines marked with various annotations:
- Point 1 is marked as 'nus<1'.
- Point 2 is labeled 'P2=P3 adiabatic rev isentrop'.
- Point 3 is labeled 'isobar'.
- Point 4 is labeled 'adiabatic rev isentrop'.
- Point 5 is labeled 'P5=Pk=p1 isobar'.
- Point 6 is labeled 'adiabatic rev isentrop'.
- A curve is labeled 'Mischkammer isobar'.
- The line between points 5 and 6 is labeled 'P6=p0'.
