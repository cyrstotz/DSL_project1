Given: T gas equals 500 degrees Celsius, V gas equals 3.94 times 10 to the power of minus 3 cubic meters.

P gas equals m times R times T divided by V.

R equals R sub M divided by M equals 8.314 times 0.16628 kilograms divided by kilogram mole equals 0.16628 kilograms divided by kilogram mole.

F equals F divided by A equals 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared plus 0.11 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 25 times pi times (0.05) squared plus 0.6 bar plus 40 pascal.

P equals 8.00999 bar equals 1000994.9006 pascal.

m equals PV divided by RT equals 5.273 kilograms (probably not).

m equals 1000994.9 pascal times 3.94 times 10 to the power of minus 3 cubic meters divided by 0.16628 kilogram mole times (500 Kelvin plus 273.15 Kelvin) equals 3.927 kilograms.
