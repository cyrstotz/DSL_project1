There are two graphs drawn on the page.

The first graph has:
- The vertical axis labeled as T in brackets with units of L in brackets.
- The horizontal axis labeled as s with units of square brackets over u.
- A curve starting from the origin labeled as point 0, moving upwards to point 1, then vertically to point 2.
- A horizontal dotted line extending from point 0.
- A note indicating "p0 = 0.1 bar" near the curve.

The second graph has:
- The vertical axis labeled as T in brackets with units of k in brackets.
- The horizontal axis labeled as s with units of square brackets over Z.
- A curve starting from the origin labeled as point 0, moving upwards to point 2, then vertically to point 3.
- A horizontal line connecting point 2 and point 4.
- Another line from point 4 down to point 6.
- A note indicating "0.5 bar" near the top right of the graph.
- An arrow pointing upwards labeled "clear" and "actual gas process."
- An arrow pointing downwards labeled "p."
