T subscript G equals T subscript S times (P subscript C divided by P subscript S) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4 equals 328.05 K.

v subscript c equals R times T subscript c divided by P subscript c equals 4.36 cubic meters per kilogram.

c subscript p subscript x subscript l subscript u subscript f subscript t divided by K equals 0.9 times 1.15 in brackets kg per K.

R equals c subscript p subscript x subscript l subscript u subscript f subscript t minus c subscript v subscript x subscript l subscript u subscript f subscript t equals 0.257 in brackets kg per K.

w subscript G

w subscript v subscript c equals minus 1.9 times (p subscript v subscript c minus p subscript v subscript 0) equals integral from p subscript v subscript 2 to p subscript v subscript 0 of w subscript c squared divided by 2 plus w subscript v subscript c squared divided by 2.

v subscript 2 equals R times T subscript 0 divided by p subscript 0 equals 3.66 cubic meters per kilogram.

Minus 1.1 times 1.15 times ln p subscript v subscript c times (9.9 times cubic meters per kilogram) minus 3.66 times w subscript v subscript c squared divided by w subscript c squared equals minus 1.5 times ln p subscript v subscript c times (4.36 cubic meters per kilogram, 3.66 cubic meters per kilogram) times w subscript c squared divided by w subscript 2000 squared equals (2000 cubic meters squared divided by 2000 cubic meters squared).

w subscript c squared divided by 2000 equals 54.7829.

w subscript c equals 321.8 meters per second.
