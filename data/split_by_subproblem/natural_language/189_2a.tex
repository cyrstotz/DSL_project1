Entropy balance on reaction mixture

b) Delta S12 equals Delta m12 times S12 plus Q R,12 minus Q out,12 plus S gen

A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as S (kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin) and the y-axis labeled as T (Kelvin). The graph shows a series of points and lines labeled with numbers 0 through 6. The points are connected by lines labeled as 'isobar' and 'isotrop'. The points are labeled with pressures p0 equals p6, p1, p2 equals p3, p4, and p5. There are annotations in red indicating 'isobar' and 'isotrop' along specific lines.

Eta s equals q dot out divided by q dot out minus q dot in equals w dot k plus q dot k divided by q dot ab.
