delta S one Q equals delta m twelve s ein plus Q j over T plus delta S one two

- T0 divided by T5 equals (P0 divided by P5) to the power of (k minus 1) over k.
- Substituting values: (0.194 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 0.1 over 1.4.
- T0 equals T5 times (0.194 divided by 0.5) to the power of 0.1 over 1.4 equals 328.07 K.

Equations:
- dE over dt equals m dot times (u5 minus uc plus (w5 squared minus uc squared) over 2).
- w0 squared equals 2 times (u5 minus u0) plus u5 squared.
