A graph is drawn with an x-axis labeled 'S' and a y-axis labeled 'T(K)'. The graph shows a curve starting from point 1, going up to point 2, then descending to point 3, and continuing to point 4. The segment from point 2 to point 3 is labeled 'Isotherm', and the segment from point 3 to point 4 is labeled 'Isochore'. There is a shaded area between the curve and the y-axis, marked between points 1 and 2. An additional segment from point 5 to point 6 is drawn, and the point 6 is labeled. There is a label 'W' near the x-axis.
