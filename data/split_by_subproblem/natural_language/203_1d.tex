First law on EW container

Delta U equals Q minus W equals c two minus c one

U two equals Q divided by m two EW plus u one implies u two equals c s plus x two times c liquid minus c s equals minus three hundred thirty-three point four five eight kilojoules per kilogram plus zero point six times open parenthesis minus zero point zero four plus two times minus three hundred thirty-three point four five eight close parenthesis kilojoules per kilogram equals minus one hundred thirty-three point four one kilojoules per kilogram (Table seven at zero degrees Celsius)

U two equals seventy-five thousand divided by zero point one seven EW plus open parenthesis minus three hundred thirty-three point four two kilojoules per kilogram close parenthesis equals seven hundred forty-eight point four one minus one hundred seventy-eight point four one kilojoules per kilogram

U two equals u s plus x two times open parenthesis u f minus u s close parenthesis implies x two equals U two minus u s divided by u f minus u s, T g two equals zero point zero zero three degrees Celsius

x two equals minus one hundred seventy-eight point four seven kilojoules per kilogram minus open parenthesis minus three hundred thirty-three point four two close parenthesis kilojoules per kilogram divided by minus zero point zero three three kilojoules per kilogram minus open parenthesis minus three hundred thirty-three point four two close parenthesis kilojoules per kilogram equals zero point six four four nine (Table seven at zero point zero zero three degrees Celsius)

Should be higher than condition seven?!
