A graph is drawn with axes labeled. The x-axis is labeled 'T in °C' and the y-axis is labeled 'Pressure in bar'. The graph shows three phases: 'Fest' (solid), 'Flüssig' (liquid), and 'Gasförmig' (gaseous). There is a line labeled 'Tripelpunkt' (triple point) and a line labeled 'Isolans (French) Wassert' (possibly 'Isotherm Water').
