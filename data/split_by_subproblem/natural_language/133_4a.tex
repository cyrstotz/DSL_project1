A table with four rows and four columns is drawn. The columns are labeled with the following headings: (U), p (bar), and x. The rows contain:

Row 1: 
- 2 u T_i 
- p: C
- x: 
- Arrow pointing to: - C_k zu T_i, Q_k

Row 2:
- p: 1
- Arrow pointing to: 1, isentrop s = const

Row 3:
- p: 8
- x: 8
- Arrow pointing to: u_k = 2 u_k, isobar

Row 4:
- p: 8
- x: 0
- Arrow pointing to: Q_A

Below the table, two diagrams are drawn:

First diagram:
- Axis labeled with T and p
- Points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4
- Lines connecting points with arrows

Second diagram:
- Axis labeled with P and T
- Points labeled 1, 2, 3
- Lines connecting points with arrows
- Label "Dampfstr√∂mig" near point 2
