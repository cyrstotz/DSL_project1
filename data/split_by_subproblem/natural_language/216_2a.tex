A graph is drawn with an upward arrow labeled 'T in °K'. The x-axis is labeled 's'. The graph contains multiple overlapping curves. Below the graph, '75 in 17 k.kg' is written.

0-1: Vorverdichter, irreversible  
p1K1 p2  
t2t3: Verdichter, reversible  
1-2: Isobar, Brennkammer  
2-3: Turbine, irreversible  
3-4: Mischkammer 0,5 bar  
4-5: Schubdüse von 0,5 bar auf 0,1 bar  

Below this list, another graph is drawn with an upward arrow labeled 'T' and a rightward arrow labeled 's'. The graph contains curves labeled with numbers 1 through 6, and lines labeled p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5. The word 'Isobaren' is written next to the graph. On the right side, the following is written:

p0 = p6  
p1  
p2 = p3  
p4 = p5
