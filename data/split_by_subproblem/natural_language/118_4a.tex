A table is presented with columns labeled T, p (bar), V, U, and S. The rows are labeled z1, z2, z3, and z4. The values are as follows:
- z1: T = 6°C, p (bar) = 1
- z2: T = -6°C, U = 243.72, S = 0.9226
- z3: p (bar) = 8
- z4: p (bar) = 8, S = 0.9226

Ti equals 0°C leading to T(z2) equals -6°C.

A graph is drawn with T (K) on the y-axis and S (L/s kg K) on the x-axis. The graph shows a curve labeled "Fest" on the left, "dampf" and "gasförmig" on the right, and "nass dampf gebiet" in the middle. Points z1, z2, z3, and z4 are marked on the graph.
