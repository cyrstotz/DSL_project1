A equals pi times (D divided by 2) squared equals pi times (0.1 meters divided by 2) squared equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.

F sub G mk equals 3.8 kilograms times 32 meters per second squared equals 3.13 newtons.

F sub G ew equals 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared equals 0.981 newtons.

P equals P ambient plus F sub G k divided by A plus F sub G ew divided by A equals 1.401 bar.

mg: rho V equals m dot RT implies m sub g equals rho V divided by RT equals M sub g times rho sub g times V sub 1 divided by D times T sub g equals 50 kilograms per mole times 1.401 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals divided by 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 divided by R times 773.15 kelvin equals 3.42 kilograms.
