a)  
Graph with labeled points and lines:  
- Vertical axis labeled with temperature in degrees Celsius.  
- Horizontal axis labeled with entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
- Points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  
- Curved lines labeled "isotherm" and "isobar p5 = 0.5 bar".  

b)  
Substance: Air, reversible  
p5 = 0.5 bar  
T5 = 431.3 Kelvin  

p6 = 0.151 bar  

T6 = 328.07 Kelvin (crossed out)  

Equation for T6:  
T6 = T1 times (p6 divided by p5) to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k)  

Energy balance for a flow process, adiabatic, PE equals 0:  

Wt = mass flow rate times (he minus ha plus (wc squared minus wd squared divided by 2))  

Wt = integral from 5 to 6 of v dp = integral from 5 to 6 of R times T divided by P dp  

Notes on the side:  
dP = RT  
v = RT divided by P
