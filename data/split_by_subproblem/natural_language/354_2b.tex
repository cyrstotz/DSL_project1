Ws equals negative 220 meters per second

p5 equals 6.5 bar

Equations and annotations are written, including:

p0 equals p6

m dot equals v dot

U0 equals U6

m dot equals p0 v0 over R T0 equals p0 over R T

The nozzle is adiabatic reversible.

It holds: T2 equals T0 times (p02 over p0) to the power of n minus 1 over n equals 328.07 Kelvin

Since the nozzle is adiabatic, it holds Q equals 0

An equation is written as:

0 equals m dot (h e minus h a) plus m dot (w2 squared minus w1 squared over 2)

w5 squared over 2 equals Cp (T5 minus T6) plus Ws squared over 2

We equals square root of 2 Cp (T5 minus T6) plus u5 squared equals 506.02 meters per second
