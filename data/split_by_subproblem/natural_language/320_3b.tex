The pressure is the same as in state 1, as the forces acting on the piston have not changed. p subscript g equals p subscript 3 equals 1.4 bar. The temperature has changed, as energy is absorbed by the heating element for heating.

Equation: C subscript v equals 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram kelvin.

Equation: C subscript p equals R plus C subscript v equals 166.25 joules per kilogram kelvin plus 633 joules per kilogram kelvin equals 799.28 joules per kilogram kelvin.
