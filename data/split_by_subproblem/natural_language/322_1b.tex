Exergy calculation:  
e exergy equals T zero times s zero divided by m zero, where T zero equals T zero.  
Entropy generation:  
Entropy balance in the entire turbine:  
dS dt equals zero equals sum of n i s i plus S zero equals m zero times S zero minus S e plus S zero.  
S zero equals S of P zero, T zero.  
S e equals S of P zero, T e.  
S e minus S a equals integral from t zero to t of c p i times T dt divided by T equals integral from t zero to t of c p i times ln of T zero divided by T equals 1.00 c p i times ln of T zero divided by T zero equals 34.0 c p i k divided by 240.5 W equals 0.3733 kJ divided by kg K.  
S zero minus S e equals q zero divided by T zero.  
S zero minus S e equals S zero minus S a minus 0.3733 kJ divided by kg K.  
e exergy equals T zero times s zero divided by m zero equals 82.01 kJ divided by kg.
