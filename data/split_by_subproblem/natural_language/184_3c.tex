Zuerst die Q sub ab berechnen vom Gas:

delta E equals m (u sub two minus u sub one) equals integral Q

u sub two minus u sub one equals C sub v p sub G (T sub two minus T sub one) equals zero point six three three times ten to the power of negative three (five hundred) equals three hundred sixteen point five kilojoules per kilogram

three point four two times ten to the power of negative three times three hundred sixteen point five equals one point zero eight three kilojoules
