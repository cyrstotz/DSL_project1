p V equals m R T  
(m empty plus m full equals 0.16 kilograms)  
Sum of forces equals zero  
p subscript s, 1 times A minus 0.1 times g minus 32 times g minus p ambient times A equals zero  
p subscript s, 1 equals (0.1 plus 32) times g divided by A plus p ambient  
A equals (pi divided by 2) squared times x equals (10 times 10 to the power of negative 3 squared) divided by 2 times x equals 0.007 equals 0.0098 cubic meters  
equals (0.1 plus 32) times g times 0.1 divided by 0.0098 plus 4 times 10 to the power of 5 equals 1.4 bar  
R equals R divided by M equals 8314 divided by 50 equals 166.28  
m subscript g, 1 equals p subscript s, 1 times V subscript g, 1 divided by R times T subscript s, 1  
equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 divided by 166.28 times 773 equals 0.0034 kilograms equals 3.4 grams

Energy balance

Q minus W equals delta U plus delta KE plus delta PE

Q12 equals W12 plus delta U12

Delta U12 equals U2 minus U1 equals m multiplied by (u2 minus u1) equals m multiplied by (cV multiplied by (Tg,2 minus Tg,1))

equals 3.6 times 10 to the power of minus 3 multiplied by 0.633 multiplied by (0.003 minus 500)

equals minus 1.14 kJ
