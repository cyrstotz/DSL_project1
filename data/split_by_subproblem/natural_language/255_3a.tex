p equals F divided by A

p one equals p Ambient plus m k times one divided by pi times (D divided by two) squared times g plus m EW times one divided by pi times (D divided by two) squared times g

equals p Ambient plus m k times g divided by pi times (D divided by two) squared plus m EW times g divided by pi times (D divided by two) squared equals 71.900 bar
