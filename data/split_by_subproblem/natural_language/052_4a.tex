A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p" and the x-axis labeled as "T [K]". The graph is divided into two parts:

1. The first part (I) is a closed quadrilateral with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The shape is a rectangle with arrows indicating a clockwise direction.
2. The second part (II) is a graph labeled "p [bar]" on the y-axis and "T [Â°C]" on the x-axis. It shows a curve with points o1 and o2 marked along with arrows indicating a direction.
