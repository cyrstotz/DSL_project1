A graph is depicted with an x-axis labeled "S in kJ/kgÂ·K" and a y-axis labeled "T in K". The graph shows a curve with several points marked along it. The points are labeled as follows: point 1, point 2, point 3, point 4, point 5, and point 6. The points P3 and P5 are highlighted, and the point P0 is marked at the start of the curve. There are arrows indicating transitions between these points.
