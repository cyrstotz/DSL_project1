Find ws and T6.

ws equals 220 meters per second, p5 equals 0.5 bar, T5 equals 431.9 Kelvin.

S5 equals S6 since it is isentropic.

Air as an ideal gas.

Cp equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

Since adiabatic:

T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of n minus 1 over n, which implies T6 equals 431.9 Kelvin times (0.191 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of 1.4 minus 1 over 1.4, which equals 328.075 Kelvin.

u6 minus u5 equals Cv times delta T.

Cv equals Cp minus R.
