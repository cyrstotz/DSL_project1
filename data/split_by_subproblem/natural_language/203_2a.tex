A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as T [K] and the x-axis labeled as S [kJ/kg K]. The graph shows a curve with points labeled 1 through 6. The sections between the points are labeled as follows: between 1 and 2 isobar, between 2 and 3 isentrop, between 3 and 4 isobar, between 4 and 5 isochor, between 5 and 6 isentrop.
