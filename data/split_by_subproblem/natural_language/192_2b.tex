pT equals 0.5 bar  
TS equals 473.8 K  
wS equals 7200 meters per second  

T6 with polytropic ratio: n equals kappa equals 1.4  

p6 equals pT times the fraction of pT over p6 to the power of n minus 1 over n  

p6 equals 0.181 bar  

T6 equals 328.1 K  

Arrow pointing to 1. HS stationary  
0 equals m dot times (hE minus hA plus one half times (wE squared minus wA squared)) plus q dot crossed out minus w dot crossed out  

stationary and v equals constant  

2 times (h6 minus h5) equals wS squared minus w6 squared  

2 times (h6 minus h5) minus wS squared equals negative w6 squared  

Square root of wS squared plus 2 times (h5 minus h6) equals w6  

h5 minus h6 equals Cp times (TS minus T6)  

Cp equals 1.006  

w6 equals 507.2 meters per second
