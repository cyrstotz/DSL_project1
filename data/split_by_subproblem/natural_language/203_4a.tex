A graph is shown with pressure (p) in bar on the y-axis and temperature (T) in degrees Celsius on the x-axis. The graph has three distinct regions labeled as 'Fest', 'Fl√ºssig', and 'Gas', indicating solid, liquid, and gas phases, respectively. The graph includes a line that separates these regions and is marked with points labeled 'X', '1', '2', and 'Tripel'.
