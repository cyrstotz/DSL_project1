A diagram is shown with a graph on a grid. The y-axis is labeled as 'rho' and the x-axis as 'T'. Various points and lines are marked on the graph: 
- A point labeled '1' is at the start of a line.
- A point labeled '2' is at the end of a vertical line labeled 'v'.
- A point labeled '3' is at the end of a horizontal line labeled 'Tripel'.
- The graph includes regions labeled 'Flüssig', 'Gas', and 'Flüssig-Gas'.
- Arrows and labels indicate directions and processes, such as 'F_en' and 'T_krg'.

Below the diagram, there are descriptions for the numbered points:
1. Zustand zu Beginn
2. Zustand nach (ii), also nach isothermen Kühlen
3. Zustand nach (iii), also nach isothermen Druckabbau
