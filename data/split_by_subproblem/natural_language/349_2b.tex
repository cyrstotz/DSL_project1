Energy balance (stationary flow process)

Zero equals m dot times (h zero minus h six plus v inlet squared minus v six squared over two) plus q B times m K

m K equals eight thousand two hundred eighty divided by five thousand two hundred ninety-three times m M

h zero equals h of T zero equals h of two hundred forty-three point one five K

equals h of two hundred forty plus (h of two hundred fifty minus h of two hundred forty over two hundred fifty minus two hundred forty) times (two hundred forty-three point one five minus two hundred forty)

equals two hundred forty-three point one eight h sub g over h sub g

h J equals h of four hundred thirty plus (h of four hundred forty minus h of four hundred thirty over four hundred forty minus four hundred thirty) times (four hundred seventy-one point nine minus four hundred thirty)

equals four hundred thirty-three point three seven h sub g over h sub g

v six equals h zero

therefore zero equals m dot times (v inlet squared minus v six squared over two) plus q B times m K

v six equals square root of (two times seven eight times m dot over m dot) plus v inlet squared
