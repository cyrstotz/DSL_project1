A graph is drawn with a vertical axis labeled with various symbols and a horizontal axis labeled 's' with units in brackets '[ t / kg t ]'. On the vertical axis, there are several labels: 'T2', 'T1', 'p3 equals pm', 'p2', 'p4', 'p4A', 'p3A', 'p0 equals 0'. The graph contains three curves labeled '1', '2', and '3', with points marked '0', '6', and '4'. The notation 'η less than 1' and 'ε equals 5' are written near the curves. A dashed line is drawn across the graph.
