Zero equals mass flow rate in times enthalpy in minus mass flow rate aus times enthalpy aus plus heat transfer rate minus work rate equals zero plus heat transfer rate.  
Enthalpy in equals enthalpy from table A-2 at seventy degrees Celsius equals two hundred eighty-two point thirty-eight kilojoules per kilogram.  
Enthalpy aus equals enthalpy from table A-2 at one hundred degrees Celsius equals four hundred fifteen point zero four kilojoules per kilogram.  
Heat transfer rate aus equals mass flow rate aus times enthalpy aus minus enthalpy in equals heat transfer rate equals mass flow rate in times enthalpy aus minus enthalpy in minus heat transfer rate.  
Heat transfer rate aus equals negative sixty-two point eighteen kilowatts.

A diagram labeled "a)" shows a graph with axes labeled "p" (R) and "T" (K). The graph depicts a curve with a region marked as "unterkühlte Flüssigkeit" (subcooled liquid) and another region labeled "übersättigter Dampf" (superheated vapor). The central region is marked as "Nassdampf" (wet steam).

Another diagram labeled "b)" has axes labeled "p" (R) and "T" (K). The graph shows a curve with regions labeled "flüssig" (liquid) and "gasförmig" (gaseous). There is a point marked "Schritt ii" (step ii) with a star symbol, and a line labeled "fest" (solid) extending from point 1.

A third diagram labeled "P" (2) has axes labeled "T" (K). The graph shows a curve with points marked 1, 2, 3, and a region labeled "Schritt i" (step i).
