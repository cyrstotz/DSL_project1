The page includes a graph labeled with 'T' on the vertical axis and 'S' on the horizontal axis, with units '[E]' and '[t/kg]' respectively. The graph has points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, showing a path with arrows indicating direction. The graph features annotations such as 'isentrope' near point 1, 'isobare' near point 3, and 'isobare p zero equals p four' near point 5. There is a smaller diagram labeled 'Spitze' next to the main graph, with points labeled 0 and 1.

Below the graph is a table labeled 'Zustandstabelle' with columns for Zustand, p [bar], T [K], m [kg/s], s, h, and w [m/s]. The rows are labeled 1 to 6 and 0. In the table:
- Zustand 1 has no specific values.
- Zustand 2 has 'p two equals p three'.
- Zustand 3 has 'p three equals p two'.
- Zustand 4 has no specific values.
- Zustand 5 has '0.5' under p [bar], '431.9' under T [K], and '220' under w [m/s].
- Zustand 6 has no specific values.
- Zustand 0 has '0.101' under p [bar], '2435' under T [K], '200' under w [m/s], and annotations 's zero equals s one' under s.
