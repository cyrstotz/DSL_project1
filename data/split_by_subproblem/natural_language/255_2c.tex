Delta ex sub six to five equals h sub six minus h sub zero minus T sub zero times s sub six minus s sub zero plus w sub six squared minus w sub zero squared over two.  
h sub zero minus h sub zero equals c sub p times T sub zero minus T sub zero equals crossed out ninety-five point four three four kJ over kg.  
s sub six minus s sub zero equals c sub p times ln T sub six over T sub zero minus R times ln P sub six over P sub zero equals zero point three zero seven six kJ over kg.  

c sub v equals c sub p over n equals seven point four five two kJ.  
R equals c sub p minus c sub v equals two hundred eighty-seven point four two five (two).  

Therefore, Delta ex sub six to five equals minus one point four zero eight times ten to the power of five J over kg equals one hundred forty point eight kJ over kg.
