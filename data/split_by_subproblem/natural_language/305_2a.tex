Two diagrams are drawn on the page. 

The first diagram is a T-s (Temperature-Entropy) graph with lines labeled "isocline" and "0.13 bar". The graph shows a process path with points labeled O, 1, and 2.

The second diagram is another T-s graph with lines labeled "isocline" and "0.019 bar". The graph shows a process path with points labeled O, 1, 2k, 3k, 4k, and 5, with additional labels "isocline" and "isochore".
