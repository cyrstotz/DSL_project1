T EW, x2 equals T y32 equals circle C, circle P.

Delta E EW, x2 equals Delta U x2 equals Q x2.

m EW (u x2 minus u) equals m EW (crossed out) equals Q x2.

Q x2 equals m EW (u fast (1.400 kJ) times X x2, E x3 plus (1 minus X x2, E x3) u flowing (1.400 kJ) minus u fast (1.400 kJ) times X x2, E x3 times (1 minus X) u flowing).

Q x2 divided by m EW equals (X x2, E x3 (u fast minus u flowing) plus u fast, y3) minus (u flowing, y3 plus X x2, E x3 (u fast minus u flowing)).

X x2, E x3 equals 1 divided by (u fast minus u flowing) divided by (Q x2 divided by m EW) plus X x2, E x3.

u fast equals minus 333.458 kJ divided by kg.

u flowing equals minus 0.048 kJ divided by kg.

Equals 1 divided by (minus 1366.5 divided by 0.1 kg) times 0.6.

X y3, E x3 equals 0.559.

X x2, E x3 equals 0.559.
