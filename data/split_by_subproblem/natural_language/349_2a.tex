The page contains two diagrams.

1. The first diagram is a graph with axes labeled T in brackets K and S in brackets kg dot K. The graph has a series of intersecting lines forming a complex shape. Points are labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, with arrows indicating a path through these points.

2. The second diagram is another graph with axes labeled T in brackets K and S in brackets kg dot K. It shows a closed loop shape with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, with arrows indicating a path. The words "isobar" are written twice inside the shape, suggesting that the process described is isobaric.
