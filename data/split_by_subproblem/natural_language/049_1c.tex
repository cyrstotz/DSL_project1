With entropy balance, we have:

Sum of Q dot i plus S gen equals sum of S out minus sum of S in.

Q equals m times S out minus S in plus S gen implies S gen equals Q dot in divided by T minus m times (S out minus S in).

Where S in and S out are interpolated from Table A-2:

S in equals x b times S f (T equals 70) plus (1 minus x b) times S g (T equals 70) equals 0.9889.

S out equals x b times S f (T equals 100) plus (1 minus x b) times S g (T equals 100) equals 1.33719.

S gen equals minus 62.299 divided by 298 plus 0.3 times 0.9889 approximately equals 211.18 kilograms per kilogram.
