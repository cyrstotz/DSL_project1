x_eis tends to zero

Pressure must remain constant. Therefore, new equilibrium

p_0 equals m dot w_s times w_s

Pressure p_s2 equals p_s1 equals one point two five bar

Thermal equilibrium in state two!

Temperatures are equal â†’ T_2 equals zero degrees Celsius, as in the saturated state at boiling point

T_s2 equals T_2 equals zero degrees Celsius
