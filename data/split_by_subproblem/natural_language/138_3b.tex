The gas absorbs Q from a part of the ice, so that T gas 2 equals T gas 1 and p gas 2 is less than p equilibrium A, as volume and mass of the gas remain constant. In equilibrium, the energies of the systems are:

E with a dot above equals d divided by dt of PEF plus d divided by dt of KE plus d divided by dt of HE equals Q with a dot above minus W with a dot above implies delta u equals Q

Perfect gas/ideal gas implies internal energy depends only on temperature implies change in temperature of the gas is equal to the system absorbed heat. Energetics of the ice-water system:

E with a dot above equals d divided by dt of PEF plus d divided by dt of KE plus d divided by dt of HE equals Q with a dot above minus W with a dot above implies delta u equals Q minus W

The change in internal energy of the system ice-water is equal to the heat plus the system performed work.

Delta u equals Q system equilibrium 1 plus V equilibrium 1 minus V equilibrium A

Note:
V equilibrium 2 equals V equilibrium A and the water ice remains incompressible, therefore V equilibrium 2 equals V equilibrium A

Therefore, the heat quantity from the gas to the ice-water is

Note:
System ice-water:
C ice equilibrium 1 times x ice 1 plus m ice times x ice equilibrium 1 times m ice equals 200.09 kilojoules per kilogram

System gas:
Delta u gas equals m gas times C v times delta T equals m gas times C v times T equilibrium 2 equals T gas 1
