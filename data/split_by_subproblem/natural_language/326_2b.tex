S sub e z equals m dot times bracket s a minus s one bracket plus Q dot sub e v a p divided by T sub k f.  
Equals m dot.

A graph is depicted with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph shows several lines labeled as follows:
- A line labeled isobar
- A line labeled isochor
- A line labeled adiabatic, irreversible
- A line labeled isoscar

There are points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on the graph.
