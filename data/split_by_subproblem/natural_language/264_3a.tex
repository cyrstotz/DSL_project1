pV equals m times R divided by M times T. R equals R divided by M equals 8.314 kilojoules divided by kilogram Kelvin divided by 50 kilograms divided by kilomole equals 0.16628 kilojoules divided by kilogram Kelvin. R equals 0.1663 kilojoules divided by kilogram Kelvin. F divided by A plus P ambient. A equals pi times r squared equals pi times (5 times 10 to the power of minus 2 meters) squared equals 7.853981 times 10 to the power of minus 3 meters squared. p s1 equals 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by (7.853981634 times 10 to the power of minus 3 meters squared) plus 100,000 newtons per meter squared equals 139,969.538 newtons per meter squared equals 1.3967 bar. pV divided by RT equals m g equals (134,969 pascals times (3.14 times 10 to the power of 3) cubic meters) divided by (0.16628 kilojoules divided by kilogram Kelvin times (500 plus 273.15) Kelvin) equals 3.418687423 Newton meters divided by Newton meters divided by kilogram. M g equals 3.41879.
