A graph is drawn with a vertical axis labeled 'T in K' and a horizontal axis labeled 's in kJ per kg K'. 

There are three curves plotted on the graph, labeled with numbers '1', '2', and '3'. 

The curve labeled '1' is marked with '0.16', the curve labeled '2' is marked with '0.5 bar', and the curve labeled '3' is marked with '0.191 bar'.

A graph is drawn with labeled points and lines. The x-axis is labeled as 'S [kJ/kg*K]'. The y-axis is labeled as 'p'. The graph includes the following points and lines:
- Points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- A line connects points 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Another line connects points 0 and 4.
- A line connects points 1 and 5.
- A line connects points 2 and 6.
- A curved line is shown passing through points 1 and 4.
- The label '0.191 bar' is written near the top of the graph.

Below the graph, the following text is written:
- "Man befindet sich am linken Teil in der Graphen."
- "steigen auf andere Seite."
