Pg,1 equals Pomb plus PEW plus PMK

PEW equals MEW divided by pi times (D divided by 2) squared, PMK equals MKG divided by pi times (D divided by 2) squared

Pg,1 equals 1 bar plus 127.91 Pa plus 39969.3 Pa

Pg,1 equals 1.9 bar

Mg: Pg,n Vg,n equals mg R Tg,n, R equals R bar divided by M, R bar equals 8.314 N m divided by kg mol, 80 kg divided by kmol

Mg: Pg,n Vg,n divided by R Tg,n equals 0.00592 kg, R equals 166.28 N divided by kg

Mg equals 3.92 g
