Energy in the flow process

a) T-s

A graph is depicted with the vertical axis labeled T in brackets K and the horizontal axis labeled S in brackets kJ per kg. The graph includes points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with lines connecting these points. The lines are labeled with processes such as isobar and isotherm. There are notes indicating P2 equals P3 and Po in brackets p2. The graph includes arrows and lines showing the direction between points.

Beside the graph, the following values are noted:
cp equals 1.006
Î¼ equals 1.9

Below the graph, a table is present with columns labeled T in brackets K and P in brackets bar. The table includes:
1 isentrop
1 isentrop
2 isobar
3 200

5 931.9 0.5
6 314.48 0.191
