Given values: p sub s, w sub c, and T sub 6.

p sub s equals 9.5 bar.
w sub s equals 220 divided by 5.

T sub 6 divided by T sub 5 equals p sub 6 divided by p sub 5 to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4.

T sub 6 equals T sub 5 times (p sub 6 divided by p sub 5) to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4.

T sub 6 equals 328.07 Kelvin (circled).

Cycle 5 to cycle 6 is isentropic.

Equals 1 divided by 6 equals 431.5 Kelvin times (15.1 kPa divided by 50 kPa) to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4.

Mass flow rate times (h sub 5 minus h sub 6) plus v sub 6 squared minus w sub c squared divided by 2 equals 0.

w sub 3 equals v sub 6.

w sub c equals v sub c.
