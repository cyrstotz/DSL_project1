Graphs are drawn on a grid with labeled axes.

First graph:
- The vertical axis is labeled T and the horizontal axis is labeled s with units in square brackets.
- Points on the graph are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.
- Lines connecting these points are labeled with terms such as 'isobar', 'isotherm', 'adiabat', 'isentrop'.
- Relationships are indicated such as p2 equals p3, p5, and p0 equals p6.

Second graph:
- Similarly, the vertical axis is labeled T and the horizontal axis is labeled s with units in square brackets.
- Points on the graph are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.5, and 6.
- Lines connecting these points are labeled with terms such as 'isobar', 'isotherm', 'adiabat', 'isentrop', and 'Hauptstrom'.
- Relationships are indicated such as p2 equals p3, p4 equals p5, and p0 equals p6.

Small graph:
- Points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.5, and 6 are connected with lines.
- The label 'Hauptstrom' is near the line connecting points 2 and 3.
