T naught equals minus 30 degrees Celsius equals 243.15 K.

Equation: P naught V naught equals R T naught implies V naught equals R T naught divided by P naught.

Equation: R c equals C p to the power of 1.9 minus C v to the power of 1.7 equals C p to the power of 1.9 minus C p divided by k equals 0.287429 kJ divided by kg, K.

Equation: V naught equals 3.65908 cubic meters divided by kg.

Equation: T c divided by T naught to the power of k minus 1 implies T c equals T naught to the power of 2.9 divided by 1.4.

Equation: T c divided by T naught equals V c divided by V naught.

Equation: T c divided by T naught equals R T c divided by F c times V naught.

Equation: C j equals R T c implies V naught equals R T c divided by F c.

Equation: T c equals R divided by F c times V naught to the power of k minus 1.

Equation: T c equals R divided by F c times V naught to the power of k minus 1 implies T c equals R divided by F c times V naught to the power of k.

T subscript 6 over T subscript 5 equals P subscript 6 over P subscript 5 to the power of k minus one over k implies T subscript 6 equals T subscript 5 times open parenthesis P subscript 6 over P subscript 5 close parenthesis to the power of k minus one over k equals 328.0747 K
