5 to 6 isentropic implies T6 over T5 equals (P6 over P5) raised to the power of k minus 1 over k, leading to T6 equals T5 times (P6 over P5) raised to the power of k minus 1 over k. 

T6 equals 431.8 Kelvin times (0.1 bar over 0.5 bar) raised to the power of 0.4 over 1.4, which equals 328.07 Kelvin.

Energy balance: 0 equals m dot times (hS minus hG minus T0 times (sS minus sG) plus Î”ke) plus the sum over j of 1 minus T0 over Tj times Qj dot minus Wj dot minus Exerj dot.
