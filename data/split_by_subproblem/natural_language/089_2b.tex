[Diagram depicting a graph with labeled axes: vertical axis labeled i [kJ/kg], horizontal axis labeled s [kJ/kgK]. Points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 connected by curves and arrows. Curves labeled as isobare and isentrope.]

b) 

Energy balance is isentropic because reversible Î”Q = 0  
T0 = Ts (P0/Ps)^(n-1)/n  
n = k = Cp/Cv = 1.4  
= 328.07 K

Where: Energy balance around control volume, stationary, one mass flow:  
pe = 0  
0 = mges(h5 - h6) + (w5^2 - w6^2)/2 + Qdot s - Wdot t, re

Note: Wdot t, re = mges
