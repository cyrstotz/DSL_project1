System (open, steady-state) stationary:

Ew dot equals dE/dt equals d/dt of (PE) equals d/dt of (U + mgh + mc^2) equals m dot (h2 - h1) plus Q dot minus W dot

=> implies that Q dot plus W dot equals zero
Mass flow rates in and out must be equal

Qk is heat of ideal displacement from R134a
=> Qk divided by m dot k equals ufg times (Tn - Ts) divided by (Tc) equals 245.94 kilojoules per kilogram times negative 24 divided by 24.17 kilojoules per kilogram equals approximately 419.67
Table A-10 for Tn equals negative 20 degrees Celsius

Qk is heat of ideal condensation from R134a for Tn equals negative 26 degrees Celsius

=> Qab divided by m dot k equals ufg times (Tn - Ts) divided by (Tc) equals 16.25 minus 242.43 equals approximately 435.68

=> m dot k times (h2 - h1) plus Q dot k equals m dot k times (h2 - h1) plus Q dot ab equals m dot k times (h2 - h1) plus Q dot ab

=> m dot k equals m dot n plus m dot k times (h2 - h1) plus Q dot ab

and h2, h1 from the table
h2 equals hg of (Tn) equals 233.34 kilojoules per kilogram
h1 equals hg of (Ts) equals 196.92 kilojoules per kilogram

=> m dot n divided by m dot k equals 0.13 divided by 5 approximately equals 4.69 kilojoules per kilogram
