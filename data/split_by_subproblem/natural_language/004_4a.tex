A graph is depicted with the vertical axis labeled as 'p (bar)' and the horizontal axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The graph shows a curve labeled 'Isotherme'. There are two points marked on the curve: point 1 and point 2. The curve is divided into two segments, labeled 'i' and 'ii'. 

Below the graph, the following notes are written:
i is sharp, delta T is less than 0
ii is isotherm
