The header "TASK 2c" is followed by the equation "Delta e exter equals Basis minus Cost 1." The following equations are "e exter 6 equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 (s6 minus s0) plus ke6," "e exter 1 equals h1 minus h0 minus T0 (s1 minus s0) plus ke7," and "e exter equals h6 minus h1 minus T0 (s6 minus s1) plus ke6 minus ke7." The next equation is "equals cP h dot (T6 minus T7) minus T0 (cP h dot ln (Tc over T0)) plus w2 squared over 2 minus w1 squared over 2." The final calculation shows "equals 171.92 67 over kg plus 11900 over 3 over 5 equals 125.47 67 over kg," with the final result underlined.
