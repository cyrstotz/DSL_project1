Equilibrium

P g1 = P0 + m e v over A g + m a over A g

sigma = 0.05 meters

A = g pi = 0.05 meters times pi

A = 0.00785 square meters

P g1 = 10 to the power of 5 pascals plus 0.14 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared times 1 over A plus 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared times 1 over A

= 140144.78 pascals

(Calculate with other units, always check the task)

Mg: p V = m R T

R = R over m = 8.314 times 10 to the power of -3 cubic meters times pascals over mole kelvin

P g1 V g1 over R T g1 = m g

R = 166.28

1.40144.78 pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of -3 cubic meters

over 166.28 times 3 over kilogram kelvin times (273.15 plus 500) kelvin

= 3.4229
