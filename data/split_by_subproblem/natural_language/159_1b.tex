TASK 1c  
Zero equals S dot entropy plus Q out over T BF minus Q out over T reactor.  
S dot entropy equals Q out times (one over T reactor minus one over T BF) equals negative forty-six point nine four six three kilojoules per Kelvin.  
Q out equals sixty-five kilowatts.  
T BF equals two hundred ninety-five Kelvin.  
T reactor equals three hundred seventy-three point one five Kelvin.
