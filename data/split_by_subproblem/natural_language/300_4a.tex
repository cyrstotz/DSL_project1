A graph is drawn with axes labeled T (Kelvin) and P (bar). The graph shows three regions labeled 'Gas', 'Flüssig', and 'Fest'. Point 1 is marked in the 'Flüssig' region, and points 2 and 3 are marked in the 'Fest' region. There are arrows indicating transitions: 'isobar' leading to 'erst gefrieren', and then 'dann sublimiert', with 'isobar' and 'isotherm' written below these transitions.
