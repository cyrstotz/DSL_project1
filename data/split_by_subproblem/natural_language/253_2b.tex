First law of thermodynamics for the overall system:
O equals m dot times (h0 plus omega squared luft divided by 2) minus h6 minus omega squared 6 divided by 2.

Therefore, 2 times (h0 minus h6 plus omega squared luft divided by 2) equals W6.

h0 minus h6 equals Cp luft times (T0 minus T6).

First law of thermodynamics for the subsystem:
T5 equals T6.
