Note: Energy balance on system 6, which is stationary:

min (u2 squared divided by 2 plus h0) minus mout (u2 squared divided by 2 plus h02) equals 0

Retime table is Ts equals 493.34 as table A-22 and line u equals ps equals 0.5 bar.

h2 at 39.9 kilojoules per kilogram equals hfg (449.04) minus hfg (430.4) divided by 404 minus 1.934 times 4 (430.4) equals 133.36

ha (0.5 bar) equals hfg 0.5472 minus hfg 0.4690 divided by 0.5472 minus 0.4690 times (0.5 minus 0.4690) plus h0 0.4690 equals
