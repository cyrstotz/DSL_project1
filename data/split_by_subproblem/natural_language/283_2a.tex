Two graphs are drawn on the page.

The first graph:
- Labeled on the y-axis as T in brackets K.
- Labeled on the x-axis as S in brackets kJ per kgK.
- The graph starts with a point labeled 0, with a curve moving upwards and to the right, reaching a point labeled 1. 
- A second curve starts from this point 1, moving upwards and then sharply downwards, reaching a point labeled 2.
- The word "isobar" is written near the curve between points 1 and 2.
- The curve continues from point 2 in a zigzag manner upwards and to the right.

The second graph:
- Labeled on the y-axis as T in brackets K.
- Labeled on the x-axis as S in brackets kJ per kgK.
- The graph starts with a point labeled 0, with a curve moving upwards and to the right, reaching a point labeled 1. 
- A second curve from point 1 moves upwards to a point labeled 2, and then further upwards to a peak labeled 3.
- The word "isochor" is written near the curve between points 2 and 3.
- The curve descends from point 3 to a point labeled 4, continues to a point labeled 5, and then to a point labeled 6.
- Near point 5, it is written T subscript 5 equals 931.0 K.
