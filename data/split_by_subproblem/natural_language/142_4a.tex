A graph is drawn on a grid. The vertical axis is labeled with 'p' and has values marked at 0.7, 1, and 10. The horizontal axis is labeled 'T [°C]' with a value marked at 0. The graph shows a curve starting from the point marked '0.7' on the vertical axis and curves upward towards the right. The curve passes through a region labeled 'flüssig' and continues upwards, reaching points labeled 'X1' and 'X2'. Above the curve, there are markings labeled 'p = 3' and 'p = 0.8'. The point 'X2' is further labeled with 'p = 9 bar'.
