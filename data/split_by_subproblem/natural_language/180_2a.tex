A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled T (k) and the x-axis labeled S. The graph contains a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The curve starts at point 1, goes through point 2, reaches point 3, moves to point 4, and ends at point 5. There are lines connecting these points, with a line labeled P intersecting the curve between points 4 and 5.
