The equation m dot times h two minus h three equals m dot times h two minus h three plus Q dot two three adiabatic minus W dot k.  
W dot k divided by h two minus h three equals m dot.  
s two equals s three and p three equals p four.  
h two equals h f plus x two times h g minus h f.  
h two equals h f and one minus x equals one.  
h three equals h of eight bar.
