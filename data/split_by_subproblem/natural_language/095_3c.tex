Given: S dot erz

STFP: Zero equals m times (s c minus s a) plus Q dot divided by T plus S dot erz

S dot erz equals m times (s a minus s e) minus Q dot divided by T

m dot equals zero point three kilograms per second

Q dot ab equals sixty-five kilowatts

T equals one hundred degrees Celsius

s c equals s a t plus x times (s a j minus s a f) at one hundred degrees Celsius

Tab AZ1 equals one point three zero six nine plus zero point zero zero five times (seven point three five four three minus one point three zero six nine) kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin equals one point three three seven four kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin

s e equals s e j plus x times (s e g minus s e f) at seventy degrees Celsius

Tab AZ1 equals zero point nine five eight nine plus zero point zero zero five times (seven point seven five five three minus zero point nine five eight nine) kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin equals zero point nine five eight nine kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin

S dot erz equals zero point three kilograms per second times (one point three three seven four minus zero point nine five eight nine) minus sixty-five kilowatts divided by three hundred seventy-three point one five Kelvin

S dot erz equals zero point two seven nine kilowatts per Kelvin

General system on cold.

Delta U equals Q one two minus W one two.

m dot times (u two minus u one) equals Q one two minus integral from one to two of p dV.
