7. H.S. behavior:

0 = mass times (h sub s minus h sub 6 plus (w sub s squared minus w sub 6 squared) over 2)

0 = h sub s minus h sub 8 plus (w sub s squared over 2 minus w sub 2 squared over 2)

w sub s squared equals 2 times (h sub s minus 2 times h sub 6 plus w sub s squared)

w sub s equals the square root of 2 times c sub p times (T sub s minus T sub 6) plus w sub s squared

T sub s equals T sub s over (P sub s over P sub c) to the power of k minus 1 over k equals 437.9 Kelvin over (0.56 bar over 0.791 bar) to the power of 0.2 over 1.2 equals approximately 328 Kelvin

w sub 6 equals the square root of 2 times 7.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (437.9 Kelvin minus 328 Kelvin) plus 220 squared meters per second

equals 220.9 meters per second
