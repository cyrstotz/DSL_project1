A graph is drawn with pressure [P] in bar on the y-axis and temperature [T] in Kelvin on the x-axis. The graph shows a curve starting from point 1, rising to point 3, and then descending. Point 2 is marked on the curve with an arrow pointing horizontally to the right. The curve is labeled with 'sol.' near the start, 'flu.' near point 2, and 'gas' near the peak at point 3.
