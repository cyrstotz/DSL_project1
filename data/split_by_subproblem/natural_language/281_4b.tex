Energy balance equation is written as: m dot R134a times (h2 minus h1) plus Q dot K equals 0. 
A derived equation is shown: m dot R134a equals negative Q dot K divided by (h2 minus h1).
Another energy balance equation: m dot R134a times (h3 minus h2) plus W dot K equals 0.
Another derived equation: m dot R134a equals negative W dot K divided by (h2 minus h3).

Q dot K: h2 (8 bar, x equals 1) equals 255.05 kJ/kg.
(TAB A8) T equals 15.45 degrees Celsius.
Delta T from 2 to 1 equals 6 degrees Celsius implies T1 equals 9.45 degrees Celsius.
