A diagram is drawn with axes labeled T and S, with the units [u/g]. The diagram includes several lines and points labeled as follows: 
- Point 1 is connected to Point 2 with the label "reversible."
- Point 2 is connected to Point 3, labeled as "P2."
- Point 3 is connected to Point 4.
- Point 4 is connected to Point 5 with a label "P2."
- Point 5 is connected to Point 6 with a label "reversible."
- The line from Point 1 to Point 6 is labeled "0.191 bar."
- The line from Point 4 to Point 5 is labeled "0.8 bar."

Below the diagram, there is a table with columns labeled Z, D, and T:
- Row 1: Z = 1, D = 0.191 bar, T = -30Â°C
- Row 2: Z = 2, D = P2
- Row 3: Z = 3, D = P2
- Row 4: Z = 4
- Row 5: Z = 5, D = 0.8 bar, T = 481.8 K
- Row 6: Z = 6, D = 0.191 bar

Another diagram is drawn with axes labeled T and S, with the units [u/g]. The diagram includes several lines and points labeled as follows:
- Point 2 is connected to Point 3 with a label "isobar."
- Point 3 is connected to Point 4.
- Point 5 is connected to Point 6 with a label "reversible."
- The line from Point 1 to Point 6 is labeled "0.191 bar."
- The line from Point 4 to Point 5 is labeled "0.8 bar."
