A graph with axes labeled p and T is shown. The graph contains:
- A curve labeled "Flüssig" and "Fest"
- Points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4
- Arrow labeled "i)" near point 1
- Arrow labeled "ii)" near point 3

Below the graph, the following text is written:
- 1) v_12, v_14
- 2 to 3: isentrop, s = const
- 2: gastförmig, nichtmittelndampf
- 4 to 1: isotherm, isobar

Equation:
- 1. HS vier: 2 to 3: 0 = ṁ (h_2 - h_3) - Ẇ_K
