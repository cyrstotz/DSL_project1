Energy balance:

Zero equals m dot times [h in minus h out] plus Q dot R minus Q dot aus

Q dot aus equals m dot times [h in minus h out] plus Q dot R

h in equals h f (70 degrees Celsius) equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram (Table A-2)

h out equals h f (200 degrees Celsius) equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram (Table A-2)

Q dot aus equals 0.3 kilograms per second times (292.98 kilojoules per kilogram minus 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram) plus 1000 kilowatts

equals 62.182 kilowatts

A graph is drawn with an upward sloping curve. The vertical axis is labeled as P and the horizontal axis as T. The curve is marked with "fuel" and "T_critical". Above the curve, the words "open" and "gaseous" are written. Below the curve, the word "gas" is visible.
