The equation is written: 
"0 = m-dot [he - ha + (we squared - wa squared) over 2 + g(ze - za)] + Q-dot = sum of W-dot"

For the section marked '5-6, isentropic':
"0 = m-dot [hs - h6 + (ws squared - w6 squared) over 2] + 0 - 0"

The equation is expanded:
"= m-ges [hr - h6 + 220 squared - w6 squared over 2]"

The search for hs - h6 is described:
": air is ZG with Cp is 1.006 kJ per kg K, 5-6 isentropic, n = k = 1.4,"

The enthalpy difference is calculated:
"h(T5) - h(T6) = Cp ig (T5 - T6)"
"= 1.006 kJ per kg K (431.9 K - T6)."

The search for ws, w6 is described:
"For entire system 0-6,"
"0 = m-dot [he - ha + we squared - wa squared over 2 + g(ze - za)] + Q-dot - sum of W-dot"

The equation is rewritten:
"0 = h-dot (5-30 degrees C) - h6(T6) = Cp ig (T0 - T6)"
"= 1.006 kJ per kg K (4 x 243.15 - T6)."

Finally, the equation is simplified:
"0 = 1.006 x (243.15 - T6) + 220 squared - w6 squared over 2"
"0 = h 1.006 (431.9 K - T6) + 220 squared - w6 squared over 2"
