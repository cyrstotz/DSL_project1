a) System is stationary.

Mass flow rate equals mass flow rate of water equals 0.1 kilograms per second.

Temperature 1 equals 70 degrees Celsius, Temperature 2 equals 70 degrees Celsius. Both are saturated liquid state of pure water.

From Table A-1: enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius equals 293.88 kilojoules per kilogram, enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.

Energy balance:
0 equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy in minus enthalpy out) plus heat transfer rate.
equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy in minus enthalpy out) plus heat transfer rate in minus heat transfer rate out.

Heat transfer rate out equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy in minus enthalpy out) plus heat transfer rate out.

equals (0.1 kilograms per second) times (293.88 kilojoules per kilogram minus 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram) plus 100 kilowatts.

equals minus 62.192 kilowatts.

b) Cooling capacity as ideal refrigerant on constant c times T1 equals c times T.

Integral from s1 to s2 of (T2 divided by c times T1) dt equals T bar equals integral from s1 to s2 of T times ds divided by s2 minus s1.

Integral from s1 to s2 of T equals integral from T1 to T2 of (1 divided by T) dt.

equals integral from T1 to T2 of (1 divided by T) dt.

equals c times integral from T1 to T2 of (1 divided by T) dt.

equals c times integral from T1 to T2 of (1 divided by T) dt.

equals T plus T times (linear).

equals T plus T times (linear).

equals 293.15 kilojoules.
