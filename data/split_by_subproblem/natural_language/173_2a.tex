A graph is drawn with axes labeled T and S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph shows several points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, connected by lines. There are annotations indicating "isobare" and "isobare p4 equals p5" and "isobare p0 equals p6" and "isobare p2 equals p3". Below the graph, a table is drawn with columns labeled T and P, and rows numbered from 0 to 6. The entries are as follows:
- Row 0: -30 degrees Celsius, 0.191 bar
- Row 5: 158.75, 0.5
- Row 6: 0.191
