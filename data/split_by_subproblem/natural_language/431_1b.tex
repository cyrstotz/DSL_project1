Average temperature equals integral from state a to state b of temperature times differential entropy over entropy at state a minus entropy at state e.  
Differential enthalpy equals temperature times differential entropy plus volume times differential pressure equals zero because isochoric.  
Average temperature equals enthalpy at state two minus enthalpy at state one over entropy at state two minus entropy at state one minus area times temperature two minus temperature one plus volume times pressure two minus pressure one over natural log of temperature two over temperature one.  
Average temperature equals temperature two minus temperature one over natural log of temperature two over temperature one equals two hundred eighty-three point twelve Kelvin.

The equation is given as:
0 equals m-dot (h2 minus h3) plus Q-dot minus W-dot.

Below this, calculations are shown:
h2 equals hfg (x2) plus hf, which equals hg (27.15 K) equals 2.95.55 kJ/kg.

s2 equals s3 equals sg (x2) plus sc equals 0.9163 kJ/kg.K.

Ti equals 10 degrees Celsius equals 283.15 K.

P1 equals 1 mbar equals P2.

T2 equals 283.15 K minus 6 K equals 277.15 K.
