An equation is written as follows: 

dE/dt = -Σṁi(hi + ve^2/2 + pe/ρe) + Q̇ - Ẇ

Q = ṁ(he - ha) + Q̇

ṁi = Ẇ - Q̇ / (he - ha)

A table is drawn with columns labeled ρ, T, and x, and rows numbered 1 to 4 with values: 
1: 0, 
2: 1, 
3: 8 bar, 
4: 8 bar.

There is a note "Wärmeübertrager" indicating a heat exchanger.

An equation is written: 

1 ≠ 2 ṁ(he - ha) + Q̇ = 0 → Q̇ = ṁ(ha - he)

There are annotations and calculations involving values Ẇk = 28 W, Q̇i = ?, and Q̇ab = ?.
