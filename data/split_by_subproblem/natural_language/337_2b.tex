The text poses two questions: 'w6 = ?', 'T6 = ?'. 

There is a diagram with points '5' and '6', labeled 'adiabat'. 

An equation is given: 
'dE/dt = mges (h5 - h6 + w5 squared over 2 - w6 squared over 2)' with additional terms 'plus Q minus psi c'. 
An equality is stated: 'i.g. cp (T5 - Tc)'.

Another equation is given: 
'(sc = s6) T6 = T5 (p6/p5) to the power of n minus 1 over n equals 328.075 K'. 
The value 'n = 1.4' is noted.

An expression is provided: 
'cp (T5 - T6) plus w6 squared over 2 equals w6 squared over 2 equals 12864.7.95'. 

A final result is given: 
'w6 equals 507.29 meters per second'.
