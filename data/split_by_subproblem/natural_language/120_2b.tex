Equation: 
0 equals m dot times (h e minus h q plus (w e squared minus w q squared) divided by 2) plus Q dot minus W dot.

Simplified equations:
0 equals h e minus h q plus (w e squared minus w q squared) divided by 2.
0 equals h 0 minus h 6 plus (w 0 squared divided by 2) minus (w 6 squared divided by 2).

Equation for w e squared:
w e squared equals 2 times (h 0 minus h 6) plus w 0 squared.

Equation for w c squared:
w c squared equals 2 times c p times (T 1 minus T G) plus w 0 squared.

Condition:
State 5 6 equals isentrop.
p 5 equals 0.13 bar, p 6 equals 0.15 bar, T 5 equals 431.5 K.

Equation for T G over T 5:
T G over T 5 equals (p c over p 5) to the power of (n minus 1) over n, where n equals 1.14.

Equation for T C:
T C equals T 5 times (p c over p 5) to the power of 0.14 over 1.14, which equals 431.9 K times (0.15 bar over 0.13 bar) to the power of 0.14 over 1.14, which equals 328.07 K.

Equation for w G:
w G equals square root of 2 times 1.006 times ((-36 times 273.15) times K minus 328.07 K) plus 200 meters per second.

Final result:
w c equals 195.5 plus meters per second squared.
