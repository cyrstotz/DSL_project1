A diagram is drawn with a horizontal line and an arrow pointing upwards labeled with a dot above a letter.

Zero equals mass flow rate sub w times enthalpy sub one minus enthalpy sub two plus heat transfer rate minus work transfer rate.

Work transfer rate equals R times temperature sub two minus temperature sub one plus volume sub zero times velocity sub two minus velocity sub one.

A notation indicating the equation is equal to R times temperature sub two minus temperature sub one divided by tau minus nu equals.

Pressure remains constant, mu equals zero.

Mass flow rate sub g times enthalpy sub one minus enthalpy sub two minus heat transfer rate.

Heat transfer rate equals mass flow rate sub g times heat capacity sub n times temperature sub one minus temperature sub two equals seven point zero eight three kilojoules.

n times V equals m times R times T.

Zero point seven kilograms plus thirty-two kilograms.
