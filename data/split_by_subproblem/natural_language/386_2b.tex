Energy balance around the entire turbine:
O equals m times (h e minus h a minus w out minus w b)

Energy balance around the disk:
O equals m times (h s minus h 6 plus w 2 squared minus w squared divided by 2) plus q, where q is adiabatic reversible.

O equals m times (s s minus s 6) plus q divided by T.

s s minus s 6 equals c p times ln (T s divided by T 6) minus R times ln (p s divided by p 6) equals 0.

T 6 equals 328.675 K.

ln (T s divided by T 6) equals w 2 squared minus w 6 squared divided by 2.

h s minus h 2 equals c p times (T s minus T 2) equals 109.998 times T s divided by T s k equals w 2 squared minus w 6 squared divided by 2.

w 6 squared equals 2 times (h s minus h 2) plus w 5 squared equals 507.29 meters per second.

c v equals c p divided by k equals 0.7155 k divided by k.

R equals c p minus c v equals 0.2889 k divided by k.
