m with dot in equals zero point three kilograms per second, T with line in equals seventy degrees, T with line aus equals one hundred degrees, X zero equals zero point zero zero zero eight. Q with line R equals one hundred kilowatts.

HS without shell

O with line equals m with dot in (h with line aus minus h with line in) plus Q with line aus plus Q with line R

Q with line aus equals zero point three (h with line aus minus h with line in) minus Q with line R

h with line in equals two hundred ninety-two point three eight @ TAB plus two @ seventy degrees Celsius
h with line aus equals four hundred thirteen point zero four @ TAB plus two @ one hundred degrees Celsius

Q with line aus equals zero point three (h with line aus minus h with line in) minus Q with line R
equals zero point three (four hundred thirteen point zero four minus two hundred ninety-two point three eight) minus one hundred kilowatts
equals minus sixty-two point one eight two kilowatts ((from tank provided))
from mantle out plus sixty-two point seven two kilowatts

Zero equals delta e x s t r plus e x q minus W e x t i n minus e x v e l

e x q equals one minus T zero over T times Z equals one minus two hundred forty-three point seventy-five over two hundred eighty-three equals zero point one three nine five equals thirty-six point nine five eight kJ per kg

e x v e l equals T zero times s zero two minus s zero two

s zero two equals s zero two minus s zero one equals Q over T

equals s zero two minus R times ln p zero over p zero equals p c equals p zero

equals ln three hundred over T zero minus R times ln p zero over p zero equals minus one point two eight nine kJ per kg

equals one point two six two kJ per kg

e x v e l equals two hundred forty-three point fifteen plus one point two six two equals three hundred six point eight five five kJ per kg
