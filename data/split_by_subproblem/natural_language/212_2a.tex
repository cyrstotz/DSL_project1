A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as T in Kelvin and the x-axis labeled as s in kilojoules per kilogram-Kelvin. The graph consists of several points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There is a curve connecting these points. The labels "drive line" and "isochor" are written near the curve. The points 0 to 3 are connected by a curve labeled "isochor," and points 4 to 5 are connected by a line labeled "isochor."
