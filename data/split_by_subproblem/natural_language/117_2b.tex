W6 squared, P6 equals P0

Energy balance from 5 to 6: stationary FP.

0 equals m dot times (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2) plus g times (z5 minus z6) plus phi minus delta phi T

0 equals m dot times (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2)

Therefore, w6 squared equals h6 minus h5 equals w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2

Therefore, w6 squared equals 2 times (h5 minus h6) plus w5 squared

5 to 6: isentropic, n equals 1.4:

T6 divided by T5 equals (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n

Therefore, T6 equals T5 times (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n

Equals 437.9 Kelvin times (0.791 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 7.4

Equals 328.0797 Kelvin

Therefore, w6 squared equals 2 times (h5 minus h6) plus w5 squared equals 2 times Cp times (T5 minus T6) plus w5 squared

w6 equals square root of 2 times 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (431.9 Kelvin minus 328.0797 Kelvin) plus 220 meters per second squared

w6 equals 234.453 meters per second
