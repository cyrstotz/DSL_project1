A table is presented with columns labeled Tg (degrees Celsius), Vg (cubic meters), and TEW. The rows are labeled Z1 and Z2. The values for Z1 are 500 for Tg, 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 for Vg, and 0 for TEW. The row for Z2 is left empty.

mEW equals 0.1 kilograms, i times Eis,1 equals mEIS over mEW equals 0.6.

D equals 10 centimeters, g equals 9.81 meters per second squared.

pGas equals pAmb plus pEisben.

pGas,n equals 1 bar plus g3Z over pi times (D over 2) squared kilograms per meter squared. This leads to 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared over pi times (0.05) squared equals 39.63 times 10 to the power of 3 newtons per meter squared equals 396.63 newtons per meter squared. Therefore, pGas,n equals 1 plus 0.4 bar equals 1.4 bar.

mGas equals pV over RT. R equals R over mg times 10 to the power of 3.

1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 multiplied by 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 over R over mg times 10 to the power of 3 times 7.3.15 equals 3.42 grams.
