The page contains two diagrams. The first diagram is labeled with points and annotations: 

- Points are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Annotations include "isentrop" next to a curve connecting points 1 and 2, and "isentrop" again between points 5 and 6.
- The x-axis is labeled with "s" and the y-axis with "T".
- Another annotation reads "Isentro" near points 1 and 2.

The second diagram is labeled with points and annotations:

- Points are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Annotations include "Isobar" next to a line connecting points 3 and 4, and "adiabat" near point 4.
- The x-axis is labeled with "s" and the y-axis with "T".
- Annotations "Isentrop" near point 1 and "Isobar" near point 2.

Delta U dot G equals minus eighty-five point four three five cubic meters per second times zero point two plus two hundred cubic meters per second equals crossed out content.

Equals minus one hundred thirty thousand eight hundred seventy-one cubic meters per second must but plus be in the same direction as U dot E.

Delta U dot E equals one hundred thirty thousand eight hundred seventy-one cubic meters per second.
