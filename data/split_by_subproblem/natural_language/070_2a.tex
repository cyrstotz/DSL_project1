Two diagrams are drawn on the page, each with axes labeled T and S (with S in brackets as [kJ/kgK]). 

Diagram 1:
- The diagram features curves labeled with numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Arrows indicate directions along the curves.
- Lines are labeled with processes such as "adiabat," "isobar," and "isentrop."
- Specific points are marked with labels: P1, P2, P0 = 0.751 bar, P0 = 0.354 bar.

Diagram 2:
- Similar structure with curves labeled with numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Arrows show directions along the curves.
- Lines are labeled with processes: "adiabat," "isobar," "adiabat," "isentrop."
- Specific points are labeled: P1, P2, P5 = 0.54 bar, P0 = 0.751 bar.
- Additional annotations: F5 = 437.9 kJ and a note of 293.75.

Each diagram is structured with curves and annotations indicating thermodynamic processes and specific pressure values at various points.
