A diagram is drawn with labeled points 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6 along a curve, which appears to be a graph. The horizontal axis is labeled S with units in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. There are dashed lines indicating transitions between points labeled p2, p1, and p0.

P zero equals m times g divided by A equals R times T g,2 divided by V.

Since the pressure from outside remains the same (delta m equals zero), P g,2 equals P g,1 equals 1.1 bar.
