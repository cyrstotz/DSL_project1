A graph is drawn with a labeled vertical axis marked 'T' and a horizontal axis marked 's'. The graph has six points labeled from 1 to 6 connected by a line. The line starts at point 1, moves up to point 2, then slightly down to point 3, sharply up to point 4, slightly down to point 5, and sharply down to point 6. The area between points 2 and 3 is shaded with diagonal lines. Next to the horizontal axis, there is a boxed label 'kJ/kg*K'.
