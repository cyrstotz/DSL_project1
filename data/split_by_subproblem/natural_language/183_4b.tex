Energy balance of the condenser:
Zero equals mass flow rate times (h two minus h three) minus work rate.

(With high s two equals s three, one high at the outlet h one equals h four (eight bar))

h four (Phan) equals h p equals ninety-three point four two kilojoules per kilogram.

Superheated is p one, Phan equals p two equals zero point zero zero five bar.

s two (one bar) equals s g (one bar) equals zero point nine three nine five kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

h two (one bar) equals h g (one bar) equals two hundred thirty-one point three five kilojoules per kilogram.

h three (s two) equals two hundred sixty-seven point eight nine plus (crossed out) two hundred seventy-eight point zero nine minus two hundred sixty-seven point eight nine divided by zero point nine seven seven nine minus zero point nine three eight eight (zero point nine three three five minus zero point nine three eight eight).

Equals two hundred sixty-eight point one one kilojoules per kilogram.
