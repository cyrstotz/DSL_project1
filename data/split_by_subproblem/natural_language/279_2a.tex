A diagram is drawn with axes labeled T (temperature) on the vertical and s (specific entropy) on the horizontal. The units for s are kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kg K). The diagram shows a cycle with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Lines are drawn connecting these points, forming a closed loop. The line connecting points 2 and 3 is labeled 'isochore', as is the line connecting points 4 and 5. The line connecting points 0 and 6 is labeled 'isobare'.
