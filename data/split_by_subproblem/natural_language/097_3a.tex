Given: P sub s1

V sub g equals 3.14 L equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters

T sub g equals 300 degrees Celsius equals 573.15 Kelvin

V sub g divided by V sub s equals m

P times V equals m times R times T

P sub s1 equals F sub Kolben divided by A plus P sub amb not equal to m sub ew times g times A equals P sub g

A equals Pi times r squared equals Pi times open parenthesis d divided by 2 close parenthesis squared equals Pi times open parenthesis 10 times 10 to the power of negative 2 divided by 2 close parenthesis squared square meters equals Pi times 1 divided by 400 square meters

m sub k plus m sub ew times g times A plus P sub amb equals P sub s1

equals 32.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per square second divided by Pi divided by 400 square meters plus 1 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascal equals 100002.47 Pascal

m equals P times V divided by R times T

R equals R divided by M equals 50 kilograms per kilomole divided by 100.28

m sub ew equals 0.11 kilograms

D equals 10 centimeters equals 10 times 10 to the power of negative 2 meters

P sub amb equals 1 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascal

m sub L equals 32 kilograms
