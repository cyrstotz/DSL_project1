p_2 = p_1 (no pressure change because the pressure depends on the weight and volume)  

Interpolation of the temperature of water:  
T (1 atm) = T (1 atm) - 9.8 - 6.1 Kelvin / T (2 bar) - T (1 atm) / 2 - 1 bar  

= -0.012 degrees Celsius (temperature must be due to the OHS because the ice is melted = set)
