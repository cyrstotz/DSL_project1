e dot ex st v zero equals (h zero minus h zero T (s zero minus s zero)) plus w zero squared divided by two equals w zero squared divided by two equals twenty kilojoules per kilogram

e dot ex st v equals h zero minus h zero minus T zero (s zero minus s zero) plus w zero squared divided by two equals cp (T zero minus T zero) minus T zero (cp ln (T zero divided by T zero) minus R ln (p zero divided by p zero)) plus w zero squared divided by two

equals one point zero zero kilojoules per kilogram (three hundred forty kelvin minus two hundred forty-three point fifteen kelvin minus two hundred forty-three point fifteen kelvin ln (three hundred forty kelvin divided by two hundred forty-three point fifteen kelvin)) plus (five hundred forty meters per second) squared divided by two

equals one thousand four hundred fifty point forty-seven kilojoules per kilogram

Delta l ex st v equals one hundred twenty-five point forty-seven kilojoules per kilogram
