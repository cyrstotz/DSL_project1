Interpolation formula:
y equals y subscript 2 minus y subscript 1 over x subscript 2 minus x subscript 1 times (x minus x subscript 1) plus y subscript 1.

The page contains two graphs:

1. The first graph is a pressure (p) versus temperature (T) diagram. It is a closed loop with four points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. The loop starts at point 1, moves to point 2, then to point 3, and finally back to point 4. There is a horizontal line labeled '8 bar' at the top of the loop between points 3 and 4.

2. The second graph is a pressure (p) versus temperature (T) diagram with pressure measured in 'bar'. The curve forms a loop with four points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. The loop starts at point 1, rises to point 4, then descends to point 3, and finally moves horizontally to point 2. The x-axis is labeled as T in Kelvin (K).
