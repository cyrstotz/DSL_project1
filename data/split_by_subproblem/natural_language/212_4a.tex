A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'p [P2]' and the x-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The graph is a closed loop with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.

d) epsilon sub c equals Q dot sub 2u divided by Q dot sub ab minus Q dot sub 2u equals Q dot sub k divided by Q dot sub ab minus Q dot sub k equals 0.02

Q dot sub k minus Q dot sub ab plus W dot sub k equals 0 implies Q dot sub k equals Q dot sub ab minus W dot sub k equals 0.652 kilowatts

0 equals m dot times h sub 3 minus h sub 4 minus Q dot sub ab implies Q dot sub k ab equals 28.652 kilowatts

h sub 4 equals h at x sub 4 equals 0, p sub 4 equals 8 bar equals 264.15
