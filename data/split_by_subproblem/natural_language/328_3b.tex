P remains the same: implies same conditions as state 1

m g over A plus ...

We see the volume is smaller: from the gas law follows that T2 is therefore smaller

T2 over T1 equals (P2 over P1) to the power of (n minus 1 over n)

n equals c p over c v equals (c p over c v) plus c v over c v

1.2627

T2 equals T1 times (P2 over P1)

T g2 equals 273.15312
