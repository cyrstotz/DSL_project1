Delta E equals Delta m one two times (u two minus u one) equals zero.

Delta E equals Delta m one two times (h two minus h one) minus Q aus one two plus Q R one two.

Equals m two u two minus m one u one equals (m one plus Delta m one two) u two minus (m one) u one.

h two equals h f (twenty degrees Celsius) equals eighty-seven point ninety-six kilojoules per kilogram.

h two equals h f (seventy degrees Celsius) equals four hundred nineteen point zero four kilojoules per kilogram.

u one equals u f (twenty degrees Celsius) equals eighty-three point ninety-five kilojoules per kilogram.

u two equals u f (seventy degrees Celsius) equals two hundred ninety-two point ninety-five kilojoules per kilogram.

m one equals five thousand seven hundred fifty-five kilograms.

Delta m one two times (h two minus h one) equals m one u two plus Delta m one two u two minus m one u one.

Delta m one two equals (m one u two minus m one u one) divided by (h two minus h one minus u two).

Equals two thousand eight hundred fifty-four kilograms.
