A graph is drawn with axes labeled as T in brackets K on the vertical axis and s in brackets kJ per kg K on the horizontal axis. The graph shows several lines labeled as 'isotherm' and 'isentrope' with lines numbered 1 to 6. Points are marked from 1 to 6 with arrows indicating direction. Annotations include "isotherm (ideales Gas)" and "isentrope (mass < 1)". Further notes mention "adiabatic reversible", "adiabatic irreversible", and "irreversible".
