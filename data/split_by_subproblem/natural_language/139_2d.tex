Isothermal system:
Delta E equals Sigma B m (h i plus w e squared divided by 2) plus Q B equals 0, because equal columns at start and end

0 equals m dot (h e minus h a minus w e squared divided by 2 minus w a squared divided by 2 plus g (z e minus z a)) minus Q13 minus V divided by t equals 0, because mass at start and end equal

0 equals m dot (h e minus h a minus w squared divided by 200 minus w a squared divided by 2) plus Q13

Square root of (Q13 divided by m dot minus the h a squared minus 200 squared) equals w a

Exchange from T6

Sum of x t, mol over n gas minus x t, mol equals T naught times S over n gas
