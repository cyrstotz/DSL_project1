A graph with axes labeled T (K) and s (kJ/kgK) is depicted. The graph contains curves and points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Annotations near the points include:
- p2 equals p3
- s3 equals s2
- p4 equals p5 equals 0.5 bar
- p1 equals 0.5 bar
- s5 equals s6

A second graph is shown with axes labeled T (K) and s (kJ/kgK). Points are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. An annotation below the graph mentions "nicht nullpunkt" and "ig-Gesetz."
