x two, ice equals the absolute value of U two minus U test divided by U ice minus U test, with T two equals zero point zero zero three degrees Celsius.

U two equals C v times (T two minus T one) plus U one.

Equals zero point six three three times (two hundred seventy-three point one five three minus seven hundred seventy-three point one five) plus (negative one hundred thirty-three point four zero).

Equals negative four hundred forty-nine point nine one kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, x two, ice equals one minus four hundred forty-nine point nine one minus negative six hundred thirty-three point four two divided by negative zero point zero seven three minus negative eight hundred thirty-three point four two equals zero point three nine four three approximately equals three hundred forty-nine point nine kilograms.
