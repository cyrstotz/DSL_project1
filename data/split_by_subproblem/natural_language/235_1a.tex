a) Energy balance cooling jacket:

dE/dt = sum over i of m_i times (h_i + ke_i + pe_i) plus sum over j of Q_j dot minus sum over n of W_n dot

= m dot (h_in minus h_aus) plus Q_aus

Energy balance compressor:

dE/dt equals the sum of m dot i times (h i plus kinetic energy plus potential energy) plus the sum of Q j dot equals the sum of n dot W n.

Zero equals m dot times (h two minus h three) minus W dot two three.

W dot two three equals minus W dot K.

m dot equals negative W K divided by (h two minus h three) equals two point eight kilograms per hour.
