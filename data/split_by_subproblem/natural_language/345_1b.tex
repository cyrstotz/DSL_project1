b) T divided by S equals T divided by S equals delta H divided by delta T divided by delta S.  
p constant.  
T divided by S equals c_p times ln(T divided by T_e).

Ẇk = ṁk (h2 - h3)
p1 = 1 bar, T1 = 100°C
s2 = s3

T2 = -22°C
h2 = 234.08 kJ
s2 = 0.9367
T3 = 267.95 kJ (273.15)
= 27.95 kg
s3 = 0.9366
TAB A-2
0.9367 = 0.9366
