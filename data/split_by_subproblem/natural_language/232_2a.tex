A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as T in brackets and the x-axis labeled as S in brackets with units kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin. The graph shows several curves and points labeled from 1 to 6. The curve between points 1 and 2 is labeled as adiabatic and isentropic. The curve between points 2 and 3 is labeled as isobar. There are notes indicating P2 equals P3, P4 equals P5, and P0 equals P6. The graph also has a note indicating a process from O1 to 1 bar equals P0 equals P6.
