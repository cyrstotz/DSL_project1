A diagram shows two forces, pew times A and mew times g, acting on a rectangular object. Another diagram shows forces mi times g and p0 times A acting on a similar object.

The equation pg,1 equals pew plus mew times g divided by A is written, resulting in 1.4 bar.

The equation mgas equals pg,1 times Vg,1 divided by R divided by M times Tg,1 equals 3.4224 g.

The equation pew equals p0 plus mi times g divided by A is shown, with an annotation that equals 1.4 bar.
