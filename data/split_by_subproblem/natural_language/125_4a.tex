Q equals m dot (he minus ha) plus Qk

Q equals m dot (he minus ha) ht minus Wk

m dot equals Wk divided by (he minus ha) equals twenty-eight Watts divided by (he minus ha)

d)

Ek equals absolute value of Qk divided by absolute value of Wk equals absolute value of Qk divided by absolute value of Wk equals
