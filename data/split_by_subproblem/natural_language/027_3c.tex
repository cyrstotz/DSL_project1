Transferred heat quantity:

Energy balance: Closed system: Delta E equals Q one two minus W rev one two

W rev one two equals the integral from V one to V two of p ausen dV equals p ausen times (crossed out text) equals p g one

equals negative two hundred twenty-three point four one joules

Delta E equals m times (u two minus u one) equals m times (C v times (T two minus T one))

equals zero point zero zero two six nine times (six point eight three three times (two hundred seventy-three point one five minus seven hundred seventy-three point one five))

equals negative eight hundred fifty-one point three eight joules

Q one two equals negative one thousand seventy-four point seven nine joules
