First, calculate. 

A equals m divided by rho. 

m equals 5.5 times 10 to the power of 3 kilograms. 

rho equals 766.28 times 1 divided by cubic meters. 

Fläche A equals pi times D squared divided by 4 equals 0.636 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters. 

Fläche equals pi times D squared divided by 4 equals G times C times F equals 5.5 square meters. 

Rho equals m divided by A minus m times m divided by m plus m equals 0. 

T1 equals m times n times v divided by A. 

equals 32.8 times 10 to the power of 6 times g divided by 860 times 10 to the power of 3 cubic meters plus 10 to the power of 6 Pa. 

equals 196.5 times 6.98 times Pa equals 7.8697 bar.
