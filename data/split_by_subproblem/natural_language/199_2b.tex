T bar equals integral from s sub one to s sub two of T d s equals d Q over T equals integral from s sub one to s sub two of d Q over T equals delta Q over ln of T sub two over T sub one equals T sub two minus T sub one over ln of T sub two over T sub one equals two hundred ninety-eight point seven five Kelvin minus two hundred eighty-eight point seven five Kelvin over ln of two hundred ninety-eight point seven five Kelvin over two hundred eighty-eight point seven five Kelvin equals two hundred ninety-three point one two Kelvin.

T6 equals T5 times the fraction of 106 over p5 to the power of n minus 1 over n equals 439.9 Kelvin. The fraction of 0.101 times 10 to the power of 5 Newton per meter squared over 0.5 times 10 to the power of 5 Newton per meter squared to the power of 1.4 minus 1 over 1.4 equals 328.07 Kelvin.

0 equals m times (h2 minus h1) minus w2 squared minus w1 squared over wc plus wm squared minus l2 over wm squared. The equation is rearranged as m times (h2 minus h1) equals c sub p times (T6 minus T5) minus 2 times w0 squared minus w6 squared over 2.

The square root of 2 times c sub p times (T6 minus T5) plus ws squared equals w6.

w0 equals the square root of negative 2 times 1.006 kJ/kgK times (328.07 Kelvin minus 439.9 Kelvin) plus (220 squared meters per second) equals 507.25 meters per second.
