A graph is drawn with a y-axis labeled 'P [bar]' and an x-axis labeled 'T [K]'. The graph shows a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. There is an arrow pointing from point 2 to point 3 labeled 'x3'. Another arrow points from point 1 to point 4 labeled 'x4'. The curve appears to represent a thermodynamic cycle.
