P total equals P ambient plus P kinetic plus P EW

P ambient equals one bar

P kinetic equals M K times g equals thirty-two kilograms times nine point eight one meters per second squared equals thirty-five thousand nine hundred sixty-nine pascals equals zero point four hundred bar

P EW equals M EW times g equals one hundred twenty-four point nine pascals equals one point two five times ten to the power of negative three bar

P total equals one point four zero one bar

M G equals P total times V one divided by R times T one equals three point four two times ten to the power of negative three kilograms equals three point four two grams

R equals R times joules per mole divided by fifty kilograms per kilomole equals one hundred sixty-six point two eight joules per kilogram
