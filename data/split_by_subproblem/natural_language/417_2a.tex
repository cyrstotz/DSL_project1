A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled T and the horizontal axis labeled s. There is a line drawn from a point on the horizontal axis upwards, slightly curving to the right.

h two equals h three hundred twenty-eight point zero seven five kilojoules per kilogram

equals h three hundred twenty kilojoules plus eight point zero seven five minus h three hundred fifty kilojoules minus h three hundred twenty kilojoules divided by ten

equals three hundred twenty point two five kilojoules per kilogram plus eight point zero seven five minus three hundred twenty point three six kilojoules per kilogram divided by ten minus three hundred twenty point two five kilojoules per kilogram divided by ten

equals three hundred twenty-eight point four zero five kilojoules per kilogram

omega a equals omega b equals two hundred twenty meters per second

omega two equals square root of two times h a minus h two plus omega a squared

equals two hundred twenty point four seven meters per second
