The equation T subscript 6 over T subscript 5 equals the pressure subscript 8 over pressure subscript 5 raised to the power of n minus 1 over n. Calculations are shown: T subscript 6 equals approximately 43.19 times (0.154 over 0.5) raised to the power of 0.9 over 1.4, resulting in 328.07 Kelvin.

The equation omega equals A times v, leading to v subscript 5 over v subscript 6 equals omega subscript 5 over omega subscript 6. The equation T subscript 6 over T subscript 5 equals omega subscript 5 over omega subscript 6, raised to the power of n minus 1. 

Omega subscript 6 equals omega subscript 5 times (T subscript 5 over T subscript 6) raised to the power of 1 over n minus 1, resulting in 437.486 meters per second.
