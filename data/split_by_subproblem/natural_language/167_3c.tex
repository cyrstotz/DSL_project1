Q equals r

S sub er,2 equals m dot times (S sub 2 minus S sub 2e) minus Q sub j divided by T sub j

Equals

S sub 2 minus S sub 2e equals 7.33 7179 equals 7.71 7179 minus 6.384 kg times kg

Q sub j equals 384.9 divided by 9.1 kg divided by s times 37.7027 kW

T sub j equals 1000 l

Implies minus 2.016291 S sub er,2

m dot sub rel equals

S sub er,2 equals m sub rel times T sub e divided by T times i divided by T minus (minus 37.7027 kW) divided by T

Delta U equals Q minus W

equals m times c times [T two minus T one] equals 70833

V two equals m times R times T divided by P equals 0.00711 meters cubed

Q equals 70833 plus 1.40 bar times (3.14 minus 1.11) meters cubed times 10^5

equals 73672 Joules equals Q
