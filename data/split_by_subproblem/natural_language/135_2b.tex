Schub d√ºse equals isentrop

T6 divided by Ts equals open bracket P6 divided by Ps close bracket to the power of n minus 1 over n. Therefore, T6 equals Ts open bracket P6 divided by Ps close bracket to the power of n minus 1 over n. 

T6 equals 431.9 Kelvin open bracket 0.79 bar divided by 0.5 bar close bracket to the power of 0.4 over 1.4 equals 328.05 Kelvin.

Stat FP:

0 equals m dot open bracket h5 minus h6 close bracket plus ws squared minus w6 squared plus Q dot minus W dot.

Therefore, w0 equals square root of 2 open bracket h5 minus h6 close bracket plus ws squared.

w0 equals square root of 2 times Cp open bracket Ts minus T6 close bracket plus 70 plus open bracket 220 meters per second close bracket squared.

w0 equals 507.24 meters per second.
