There are three graphs labeled with 'T' and 's'. 

The first graph has an upward curve followed by a downward curve. The axes are labeled 'T' on the vertical axis and 's' on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis has an additional label 'in l' and the horizontal axis has 's in kJ/kg'.

The second graph is a stepped line with four distinct points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The axes are labeled 'T' on the vertical axis and 's' on the horizontal axis.

The third graph is a curve with six points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The vertical axis is labeled 'T' and has an additional label 'in l'. The horizontal axis is labeled 's' with an additional label 'kJ/kg'. There is a notation 'T3 = 431.94' next to the vertical axis. The curve includes a segment labeled 'isobar'.
