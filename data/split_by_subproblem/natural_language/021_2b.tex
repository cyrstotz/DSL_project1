Isentropic process: n equals k equals 1.4

T6 equals T5 times the quantity (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.

T6 equals 431.9 Kelvin times the quantity (0.194 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1) divided by 1.4.

T6 equals 328.075 Kelvin.

T6 equals 328.075 Kelvin (boxed).
