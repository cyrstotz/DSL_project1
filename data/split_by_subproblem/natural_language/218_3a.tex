Fn equals mk times g plus mew times g plus po.  
- 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared plus 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared equals 314.80 kilograms meter per second squared plus 1 times 10 to the power of 5 pascal.  
pg times A equals Fn.  
A equals r squared times pi equals 0.05 meters squared times pi equals 0.00785 square meters.  
pg equals 314.80 plus 1 times 10 to the power of 5 pascal divided by A equals 1.4 bar.  

mg equals p times V divided by R times T.  
pg equals 1.5 bar.  
T equals 773 Kelvin.  
V equals B equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.  
R equals 8.314 meter squared kilogram per second squared Kelvin mole divided by 50 kilograms per mole equals 166.28 gram per mole.
