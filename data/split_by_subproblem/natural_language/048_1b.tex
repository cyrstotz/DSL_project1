T bar KF equals the integral from s zero to s e of T d s over s e minus s zero, ideal fluid cycle, equals T KF out plus T KF in over 2, equals 298.75 Kelvin plus 288.15 Kelvin over 2, equals 293.15 Kelvin.

x sub n equals h sub n minus h sub f divided by h sub g minus h sub f equals h sub f minus h sub f at pressure one divided by h sub g at pressure one minus h sub f at pressure one.
