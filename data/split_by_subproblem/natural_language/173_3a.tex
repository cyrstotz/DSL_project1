Pressure Pg,1 and mass of gas mg

[Diagram of a piston with arrows labeled "EV Kolben" and "Atmos" pointing downwards, and "Pg,1" pointing upwards]

Pg,1 times Azy1 equals me times g plus mi times g minus Patmos times Azy1

Azy1 equals pi times r squared equals pi times (0.06 meters) squared equals 7.853982 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters

Pg,1 equals me times g divided by Azy1 plus mi times g divided by Azy1 plus Patmos

Pg,1 equals 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 7.853982 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters plus 32 times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 7.853982 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters plus 10 to the power of 5 pascals

Pg,1 equals 140094.4137 pascals

pV equals mRT

T1 equals 500 degrees Celsius equals 773.15 Kelvin

p1 equals 140000 pascals

V1 equals 3.141 equals 0.003141 cubic meters

mg equals RT1 divided by p1V1

R equals R divided by M equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole per Kelvin divided by 56 kilograms per kilomole equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin

mg equals 0.16628 times 773.15 divided by 0.003141 times 140000 equals 0.2922 kilograms
