T in brackets KJ

A graph is drawn with an upward-pointing arrow on the y-axis and a rightward-pointing arrow on the x-axis. The graph has a curve that starts from the left, rises to a peak, and then falls sharply. The curve is labeled with numbers 2, 4, 5, and 6 at different points. There is a horizontal line connecting points 2 and 4, and a vertical line from point 2 to the x-axis. The x-axis is labeled S in brackets with a fraction inside the brackets, which is log base 2.
