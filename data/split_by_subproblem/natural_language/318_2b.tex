Calculate W six and T six. 

s five equals s six

p six equals zero point one nine one bar

T six over T five equals p six over p five to the power of n minus one over n implies T six equals p six over p five to the power of zero point four over one point four times T five equals three hundred twenty point zero seven K

V five equals two hundred twenty meters cubed per second times s A
