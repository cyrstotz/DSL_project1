O equals E sub x sub m plus sum of E sub r sub z minus sum of (w sub p times delta u sub t divided by delta t) minus E sub x sub z

R index r index z index r equals e sub u index r equals (one minus T sub o divided by T sub j) times Q minus [sum of w sub i index n minus p sub o times ln(z sub t sub l minus one)]
