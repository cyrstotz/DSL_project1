p gas equals p gz and p gz equals p gz equals p zero plus mass zero times g minus mass zero times g equals p gz. p gz equals 1.1 bar, since the mass of the iron remains the same after the density change (density constant, incompressible) remains the same. v gz equals v gz divided by density constant, incompressible. t gz equals zero degrees Celsius equals 273.15 Kelvin, since it is still in water. The water does not heat up further because it is not compressible.
