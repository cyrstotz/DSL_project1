a) Q dot out with energy balance around fluid with (stationary)  
O = sum m dot (h i + v i squared over two + g z i) = sum Q dot j - sum W dot i  
→ O = m dot (h in - h out) - Q dot out + Q dot in  
→ Q dot out = m dot (h in - h out) + Q dot in  
h in = 90 degrees Celsius entering fluid  
h out = 100 degrees Celsius exiting fluid  

b) T u F = integral from S in to S out of T dS  

c) Entropy production in system  
Entropy balance at wall between fluid and heat transfer  
→ O = Q dot out over T out - Q dot in over T u F  
→ S dot production = Q dot out over T u F - Q dot in over T reactor 1  
→ S dot production = Q dot out (1 over T u F - 1 over T reactor 1)  
= 65 kilowatts (1 over 295 Kelvin - 1 over 373.15 Kelvin)  
= 0.0461 kilowatts  

d) Energy balance 1 to 2  
dE over dt = sum m dot (h i + v i squared over two + g z i) + sum Q dot j - sum W dot i  
→ delta U over dt = m dot 1 h 1 - m dot 2 h 2 + Q dot in  
→ m dot max (u 1 - u 2) = m dot 1 h 1 - m dot 2 h 2 + Q dot in  
→ m dot max = (m dot 1 h 1 - m dot 2 h 2 + Q dot in) over (u 1 - u 2)  
= (m dot 1 h 1 - m dot 2 h 2) + Q dot in over (u 1 - u 2)

a) TLK graph with a curve labeled from 1 to 2, and then to 3. The graph is marked with lines labeled 'isobar' and 'isotherm'. Below the graph, there are explanations regarding processes: 'verlassen sind adiab reversibel', 'wenn nicht reeds all dann handelt es sich um eine isotrope diffusion oder Verdichtung'.
