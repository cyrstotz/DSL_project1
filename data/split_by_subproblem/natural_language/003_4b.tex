The equation is written as follows: 

dE/dt equals the sum over i of m sub i of t times h sub i of t plus k sub i of t squared plus pe sub i of t plus the sum over j of q sub j of t minus the sum over n of w dot sub n of t.

H dot u equals m dot times (h2 minus h3).

T2 equals T1 minus CU.

Additional notes include:

p1 equals p2
p3 equals p4 equals delta p dot.
