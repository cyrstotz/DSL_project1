Two graphs are drawn. The first graph on the left is labeled with axes p (pressure) and T (temperature). It shows a shaded area with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 'Tripel'. There is a line connecting these points and a region marked between them. The point p2 is indicated on the graph. Below the graph, it is written: 

Ti equals 5 degrees Celsius.

Below that, a list is present:
1. r2 equals p1
2. p2 equals p1
3. 8 bar
4. 6 bar

x2 equals 1
x equals 0
w equals 28 omega

The second graph on the right is also labeled with axes p and T. It shows a square with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 'Tripel'.
