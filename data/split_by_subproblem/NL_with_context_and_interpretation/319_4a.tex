Two diagrams are drawn:  
- The first diagram is labeled with "p" on the y-axis and "Tink" on the x-axis. It shows intersecting curves, with one labeled "p_har" and another labeled "p_ind". The text "geht nach unten wie in (* eingef√§rbt)" is written near the curves.  
- The second diagram is labeled with "p" on the y-axis and "Tink" on the x-axis. It includes phase regions labeled "solid," "liquid," and "gas." The regions are marked with colored lines and points. The text "fast sauber - amber - gas" is written near the diagram.
