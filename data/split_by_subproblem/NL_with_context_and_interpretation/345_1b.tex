T mean equals integral of T divided by S equals delta H divided by delta S.  
S equals S2 minus S1.  
S2 equals 0.9590 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (from Table A-2).  
S1 equals 1.3000 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (from Table A-2).  
T mean equals integral of c_p multiplied by T divided by c_p multiplied by ln(T2 divided by T1).  
T mean equals 203.72 Kelvin.
