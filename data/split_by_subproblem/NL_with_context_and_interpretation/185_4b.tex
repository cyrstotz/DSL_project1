The energy balance for the entire system is described:  
\[
\dot{W}_k / \dot{m} = w_k + kev
\]  
\[
w_k = \int v dp
\]  
\[
\dot{m} = \dot{W}_k / w_k
\]  
Temperature interpolation is mentioned, but the text is partially crossed out.  
The equation \(\Delta U = q - W\) is written.

The heading reads: "m_R mit Energiebilanz um".  

A table is drawn with columns labeled \( + \, ic \) and \( p \).  
1. Row 1: "NO reg sat".  
2. Row 2: "vap sat" and "Aus Tab A10 bei sat". \( p_2 = p_1 \).  
3. Row 3: "VSuphen." and "TAB MS bei 8bar". Value: \( 8 \).  
4. Row 4: "liq sat". Value: \( 31.33 \).
