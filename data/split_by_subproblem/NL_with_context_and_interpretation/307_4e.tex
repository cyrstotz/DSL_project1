The temperature inside the freeze dryer will decrease further but at an increasingly slower rate. It cannot decrease indefinitely to absolute zero.  

A graph is drawn showing a curve labeled "T" versus "t" (time), with the temperature dropping steeply at first and then leveling off over time. The graph is labeled "so ein Verlauf" (such a progression).
