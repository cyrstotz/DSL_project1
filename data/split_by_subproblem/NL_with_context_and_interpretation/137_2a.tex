A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kg·K]'. The graph shows three isobars labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_1 \). The process paths are labeled as follows:  
- '2 Verdichtung' (compression)  
- 'B'  
- 'C'  
- '0'  
The text next to the graph states:  
"Air, ideal gas → no condensation.  
Isentropic process.  
Work is generated."
