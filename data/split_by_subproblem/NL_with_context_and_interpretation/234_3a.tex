A diagram is shown with arrows indicating forces acting on a rectangular object. The forces are labeled as follows:  
- \( p_{\text{ew}} \cdot A \) and \( m_{\text{ew}} \cdot g \) acting downward.  
- \( p_{g,1} \cdot A \) acting upward.  

The equation for \( p_{g,1} \) is written as:  
\( p_{g,1} = p_{\text{ew}} + \frac{m_{\text{ew}} \cdot g}{A} \)  
\( = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \)  

The mass of the gas \( m_{\text{gas}} \) is calculated as:  
\( m_{\text{gas}} = \frac{p_{g,1} \cdot V_{g,1}}{R / M \cdot T_{g,1}} \)  
\( = 3.4224 \, \text{g} \)  

Another diagram is shown with similar forces labeled, and the equation for \( p_{\text{ew}} \) is written as:  
\( p_{\text{ew}} = p_0 + \frac{m_{\text{ew}} \cdot g}{A} = \text{also } 1.4 \, \text{bar} \)
