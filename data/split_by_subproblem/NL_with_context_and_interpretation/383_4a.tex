A table is presented with the following columns:  
- Zustand (State): 1, 2, 3, 4  
- T [K]: The temperature for state 2 is crossed out.  
- p [bar]:  
  - p1 = p2  
  - p2 = p1  
  - 8  
  - p4 = p3  
- x []:  
  - 1 for state 2  
  - 0 for state 4  

Below the table, a p-T diagram is drawn. The diagram shows a curve with labeled points:  
- State 1 at the bottom left  
- State 2 moving horizontally to the right  
- State 3 at the peak of the curve  
- State 4 descending horizontally to the right
