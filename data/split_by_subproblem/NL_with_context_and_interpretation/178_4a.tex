A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T in Kelvin) on the x-axis. The graph shows a typical refrigeration cycle with four labeled points:  
- Point 1 is at the lower right.  
- Point 2 is at the lower left.  
- Point 3 is at the upper left.  
- Point 4 is at the upper right.  
Arrows indicate the direction of the cycle, moving from 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1.
