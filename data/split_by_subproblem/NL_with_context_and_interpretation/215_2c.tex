Delta exergy of the stream equals exergy of the stream at state 6 minus exergy of the stream at state 0.  
Delta exergy equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (S6 minus S0) plus Delta ke.  

cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0).  
cp multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p6 divided by p0).  

Values:  
85.43 kilojoules per kilogram for part c.  
73.28 kilojoules per kilogram for part b.  
217.297 kilojoules per kilogram for Delta ke.  

Final result:  
Delta exergy equals 229.455 kilojoules per kilogram.
