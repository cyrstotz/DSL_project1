a) \( Q_{aus} \)  

Two diagrams are drawn:  
- The first diagram shows a rectangular box labeled "KF1" and "KF2" on the left and right sides, respectively, with arrows pointing inward. An arrow labeled "1, w" enters the top of the box, and an arrow labeled "2, w" exits the bottom.  
- The second diagram shows a similar rectangular box with arrows labeled \( h_{aw} \) entering from the left and \( h_{zw} \) exiting to the right. An arrow labeled \( \dot{Q}_{aus} \) points outward from the top of the box.  

Equation:  
\( \frac{dE}{dt} = 0 = \dot{m}(h_{zw} - h_{aw}) + \dot{Q}_{aus} \)  

\( h_{aw}(70^\circ C, x = 1) \)  
\( h_{zw}(100^\circ C, x = 1) \)  

\( Q_{aus} = \dot{m}(h_{zw} - h_{aw}) \)
