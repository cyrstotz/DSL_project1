A table is provided with columns labeled as P, V, h, x, and S. The rows contain the following values:  
1: P = -, V = -, h = -, x = 0.92, S = -  
2: P = -, V = -, h = -, x = 0.92, S = -  
3: P = 8, V = -, h = -, x = 1, S = -  
4: P = 8, V = -, h = -, x = 0, S = -  

Additional notes:  
- Ti = -70°C, T2 = -76°C  
- h2 = 237.74  
- S2 = 0.9295  

Equations and calculations:  
m times delta h equals W dot 23.  
m equals W divided by h3 minus h2.  
m dot equals W divided by h3 minus h2 equals 28 W divided by (827.91 minus 237.74) equals 0.008634 kilograms per second.  
m dot times 3600 equals 3.0 kilograms per hour.
