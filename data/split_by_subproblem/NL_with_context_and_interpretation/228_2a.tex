A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]'. The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Between points 1 and 2, the process is shown as an isentropic line.  
- Between points 2 and 3, the process is labeled as 'isobaric'.  
- Between points 3 and 4, the process is labeled as 'isobaric'.  
- Between points 5 and 6, the process is labeled as 'isoentropic'.
