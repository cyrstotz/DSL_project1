A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 'S (kJ/kgÂ·K)' and the y-axis labeled as 'T (K)'. The graph shows several curves labeled with pressure values: \( p_0 = p_8 \), \( p_4 = p_5 \), and \( p_2 = p_3 \). Points are marked on the curves corresponding to states 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with arrows indicating transitions between these states.
