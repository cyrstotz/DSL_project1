A diagram is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled points and lines:  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 via an isobaric line.  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 via a diagonal line labeled "3'".  
- Point 3 is connected back to point 1, forming a cycle.  
- The label "(1)" appears near the diagram.
