A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]". The graph represents a T-s diagram with six numbered points (1 to 6) connected by curves. The following processes are labeled:  
- Between points 1 and 2: "isentrop"  
- Between points 2 and 3: "indoor"  
- Between points 3 and 4: "indoor"  
- Between points 4 and 5: "indoor"  
- Between points 5 and 6: "isentrop"  
- Between points 6 and 1: "isentrop"  

Additionally, the pressure at point 6 is noted as "p6 = p0 → isobar".
