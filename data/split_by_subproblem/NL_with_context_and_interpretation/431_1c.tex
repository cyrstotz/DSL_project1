Zero equals heat flow out divided by mean temperature minus heat flow out divided by temperature plus entropy production.  

Entropy production (\( \dot{S}_{erz} \)) equals heat flow out divided by temperature minus heat flow out divided by mean temperature.  
\( \dot{S}_{erz} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{out}}{T} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{out}}{\bar{T}} \)  

\( \dot{S}_{erz} = 0.045 \, \text{kW/K} \)
