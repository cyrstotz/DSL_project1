A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 'P (bar)' and the y-axis labeled as 'T (K)'. The graph includes three regions: 'Gas', 'Flüssig' (Liquid), and 'Fest' (Solid). A curve separates the regions, with points labeled '1', '2', and '3'. Below the graph, the following text is written:  
- "isobar → erst gefrieren → dann sublimiert" (isobar → first freeze → then sublimate)  
- "isotherm"
