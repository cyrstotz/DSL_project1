Delta U equals Q from state 1 to state 2 minus W from state 1 to state 2.  

U2 minus U1 equals Q from state 1 to state 2 minus W from state 1 to state 2.  

q2 minus u2 equals q from state 1 to state 2 minus w from state 1 to state 2.  

Q from state 1 to state 2 equals U2 minus U1 plus W from state 1 to state 2.  

This is only from the gas (volume work).  

Equals mEW times (u2EW minus u1EW) plus mg times (u2g minus u1g) plus integral from state 1 to state 2 of p dV.  

p integral from state 1 to state 2 of dV equals (V2 minus V1).  

p equals 9.4 bar.  

Isentropic relation:  

T2 divided by T1 equals (V1 divided by V2) raised to the power of n minus 1.  

n equals k equals R divided by Cv plus Cv divided by Cv equals 1.2627.  

V1 divided by V2 equals (T2 divided by T1) raised to the power of 1 divided by n minus 1.  

V2 equals V1 times (T2 divided by T1) raised to the power of 1 divided by n minus 1.  

Equals V1 divided by mg times 1 divided by (273.15 divided by 500 plus 273.15) raised to the power of 1 divided by n minus 1.  

Equals 0.1682.  

V2 equals mg times V2.  

p integral from state 1 to state 2 of dV equals 0.06667.
