s4 equals s1.  
p4 equals p1.  

At s4 at 8 bar, x equals 0, resulting in 0.3455.  

x1 equals (s1 minus sf) divided by (sg minus sf).  

T1 equals 263.15 Kelvin.  

Calculation steps:  
s1 equals 0.1583 minus 0.158 divided by (-12 plus 8), resulting in 0.12755.  
sf equals 0.5258.  
sg equals 0.5235 minus 0.524 divided by (-12 plus 8), resulting in 0.8253.  

Final result:  
x equals 0.773.
