w_6 equals 510 meters per second.  

Delta exergy flow equals exergy flow at state 6 minus exergy flow at state 0.  

exergy flow at state 6 equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus surrounding temperature multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0)) plus w_6 squared divided by 2.  

exergy flow at state 0 equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 0 minus surrounding temperature multiplied by (entropy at state 0 minus entropy at state 0)) plus w_0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy flow equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus surrounding temperature multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0)) plus w_6 squared divided by 2 minus w_0 squared divided by 2.  

h_6 minus h_0 equals specific heat capacity of air multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) equals 85.435 kilojoules per kilogram.  

s_6 minus s_0 equals specific heat capacity of air multiplied by ln(T_6 divided by T_0) minus gas constant multiplied by ln(p_6 divided by p_0).  

Equals specific heat capacity of air multiplied by ln(T_6 divided by T_0) equals 0.361 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

w_6 squared divided by 2 minus w_0 squared divided by 2 equals 103850.  

This term is relevant directly to the calculation.
