The pressure \( p_{g2} \) is equal to \( p_{g1} \) because the same weight is still pressing on the gas.  
\( p_{g2} = 14 \, \text{bar} \)  

The temperature \( T_{g2} \) is equal to \( T_{g1} \) because after the gas is set, the temperature remains constant when \( p \) is constant, \( V \) is constant, and \( m \) is constant.  

\( T_{g2} = T_{g1} \)  
\( T_{g2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)
