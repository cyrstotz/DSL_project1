The equation is written as:  
T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 5 equals (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

Below, the calculation is shown:  
T subscript 6 equals T subscript 5 multiplied by (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  
T subscript 6 equals 937.9 K multiplied by (0.757 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (2.4 minus 1 divided by 2.4).  
T subscript 6 equals 327.4 K.  

The final result is underlined: 327.4 K.
