Two diagrams are drawn to represent the freeze-drying process:  

**Diagram i:**  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature), and the y-axis is labeled as 'P' (pressure).  
- The diagram shows a curve labeled 'Gas' and a region labeled 'Flüssig' (liquid).  
- States 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked along the curve.  
- A note states: "Alle Zustände sind im Dreiphasengebiet" (All states are in the three-phase region).  

**Diagram ii:**  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature), and the y-axis is labeled as 'P' (pressure).  
- The diagram shows a curve labeled 'Flüssig' (liquid) and 'Gas'.  
- States 1 and 2 are marked along the curve.  
- A note states: "ΔT = 10K" (temperature difference is 10 Kelvin).
