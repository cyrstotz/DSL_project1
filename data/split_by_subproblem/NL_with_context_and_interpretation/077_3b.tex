x_Ice,2 > 0  
T_g,2 = ?  
p_g,2 = ?  

R, m → constant  
V is smaller  

p_g,2: because T_g,2 is not dependent on V, but rather on p and A and m_K  

ΔT: T = pV / mR  
T is smaller  

Polytropic temperature relationship:  
T_2 = T_1 × (p_2 / p_1)^((n-1)/n)  

C_p = R + C_v = 0.1663 (kJ / kg·K) + 0.633 (kJ / kg·K) = 0.7993 (kJ / kg·K)

K equals cp divided by cv equals 0.7993 divided by 0.633 equals 1.263.  

V becomes smaller, p becomes larger, and since the gas also loses heat, T becomes smaller.  

T2 equals 773 K multiplied by (p2 divided by 1.5) multiplied by (0.26 divided by 1.26).
