\( c_{p}^{Luft} = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)  
\( \kappa = 1.4 \)  

A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and the x-axis labeled as \( s \) (specific entropy, \( \text{kJ/kg·K} \)).  
The graph includes several curves and labeled points:  
- Point 1, Point 2, Point 3, Point 4, Point 5, and Point 6.  
- Arrows indicate transitions between these points.  
- The processes are labeled as "isobar" and "adiabatic, irreversible."
