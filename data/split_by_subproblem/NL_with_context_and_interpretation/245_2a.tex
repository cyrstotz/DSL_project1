A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]' and the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The graph represents a T-s diagram with the following points and annotations:  
- Point 0 is at the bottom right.  
- Point 6 is slightly above point 0, connected by a horizontal line.  
- Point 4/5 is above point 6, connected by a line labeled 'adiabat, rev.'  
- Point 3 is at the top left, connected to point 4/5 by a line labeled 'isobar'.  
- Point 2 is below point 3, connected by a line labeled 'adiabat, irrev.'.
