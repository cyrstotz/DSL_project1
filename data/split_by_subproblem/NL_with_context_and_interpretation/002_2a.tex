Air as a perfect gas  

A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left  
- Point 1 slightly above and to the right of Point 0  
- Point 2 higher up, connected by a curve to Point 1  
- Point 3 connected to Point 2 by a straight line  
- Point 4 connected to Point 3 by a curve  
- Point 5 connected to Point 4 by a straight line  
- Point 6 connected to Point 5 by a curve leading back down toward Point 0  

The diagram includes two red isobars labeled \( p_Z = p_3 \) and \( p_E = p_0 \).  
The x-axis is labeled as entropy in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \), and the y-axis is labeled as temperature in \( \text{K} \).
