Entropy balance of the cooling fluid:  

0 equals mass flow rate of cooling fluid times (entropy out minus entropy in) plus entropy production.  

Entropy balance of the cooling fluid:  
0 equals mass flow rate of cooling fluid times (enthalpy out minus enthalpy in) plus heat flow out divided by temperature.  

Pressure does not change (reversible).  

Entropy out equals entropy of cooling fluid at outlet.  
Entropy in equals entropy of cooling fluid at inlet.  

Mean temperature equals integral of temperature times differential entropy divided by entropy change.  

Mean temperature equals heat flow divided by entropy change.  

Entropy change equals enthalpy change divided by temperature.  

Enthalpy change equals specific heat capacity times (temperature out minus temperature in).  

Entropy change equals specific heat capacity times natural logarithm of temperature out divided by temperature in.  

Mean temperature equals specific heat capacity times (temperature out minus temperature in) divided by specific heat capacity times natural logarithm of temperature out divided by temperature in.  

Mean temperature equals (temperature out minus temperature in) divided by natural logarithm of temperature out divided by temperature in.  

Mean temperature equals 293.72 kelvin.
