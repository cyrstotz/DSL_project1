Isobaric and isothermal sublimation below the triple point of water.  
Assumptions:  
- Adiabatic, reversible compression.  
- \( Q < 0 \), \( Q > 0 \).  
- Adiabatic.  
- Isobaric condensation and isobaric evaporation assumed.  
- Adiabatic expansion.  

Graph:  
A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled axes (p for pressure, T for temperature).  
The graph includes labeled points: \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), \( p_3 \), \( p_4 \).  
The temperature \( T_i \) is derived from the graph and is stated as:  
\( T_i = -20^\circ C \), \( T_{tr} = -26^\circ C \).
