A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn. The y-axis is labeled as 'p' (pressure) in bar, and the x-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature) in Kelvin. The diagram includes phase regions labeled as 'Fest' (solid), 'Fl√ºssig' (liquid), and 'Gas' (gas). A curve separates the solid and liquid regions, labeled as 'Sublimation I'. Three states are marked:  
- State 1 is in the gas region.  
- State 2 is in the liquid region.  
- State 3 is along the curve separating the solid and liquid regions.  
Arrows indicate transitions between states, with labels 'isobar' and 'isotherm'. A scale of 10K is marked along the x-axis.
