A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "[k] kg/K". The graph shows a qualitative T-s diagram with six points labeled as 1, 2, 3/p2 = p3, 4, 5, and 6. The isobars are marked, and the pressures are indicated as \( p_0 = p_6 \).

Zero equals m total multiplied by the change in flow exergy plus Z multiplied by W dot minus exergy loss.  

W zero equals  

Exergy loss equals m total multiplied by the change in flow exergy minus W dot.
