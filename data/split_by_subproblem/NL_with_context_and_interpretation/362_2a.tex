A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points and processes:  
- The y-axis is labeled as temperature in degrees Celsius [°C].  
- The x-axis is labeled as entropy [S in kg·k].  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the diagram.  
- Two isobars are drawn and labeled: one at \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- Processes between points are indicated with arrows, including reversible and adiabatic paths.
