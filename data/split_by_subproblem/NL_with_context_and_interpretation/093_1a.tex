A graph is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
- The y-axis is labeled as "p" (pressure).  
- A curve is drawn, resembling a phase diagram, with a marked triple point labeled "Triplepunkt."  
- The regions are labeled: "Subl." (sublimation) and "8Â°."

Energy balance for the reactor:  

Steady-state operation:  
Zero equals inlet mass flow rate times (enthalpy at inlet minus enthalpy at outlet minus kinetic energy minus potential energy) plus reaction heat flow plus heat flow to coolant.  

Sum of inlet mass flow rate equals zero.  

Enthalpy values from Table A-2:  
Enthalpy at inlet equals enthalpy of saturated liquid at 70 degrees Celsius equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.  
Enthalpy at outlet equals enthalpy of saturated liquid at 100 degrees Celsius equals 419.01 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Heat flow to coolant:  
Heat flow equals inlet mass flow rate times (enthalpy at inlet minus enthalpy at outlet) plus reaction heat flow.  
Equals 0.3 kilograms per second times (292.98 kilojoules per kilogram minus 419.01 kilojoules per kilogram) plus 100 kilowatts.  
Equals 61.7 kilowatts.
