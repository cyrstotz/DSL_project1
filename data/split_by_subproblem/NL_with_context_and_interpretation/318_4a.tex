A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. The graph shows phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gasförmig" (gaseous). The triple point is marked, and two processes are labeled: "i" (freezing) and "ii" (isothermal sublimation). The curve transitions between the phases, with annotations indicating "isobar" and "isotherm."
