Triple point: 0°C  
T sublimation (water) = -20°C  
Constant preset \( T_i \) with 10K above \( T_{subl} \), \( T_i = -10°C \)  

Diagram:  
A pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram is drawn.  
- The triple point is labeled.  
- The regions for gas, frozen phase, and sublimation are indicated.  
- Sublimation and isotherm processes are marked with arrows.
