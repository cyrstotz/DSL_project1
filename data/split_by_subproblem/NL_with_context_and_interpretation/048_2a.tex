A graph is drawn representing a T-s diagram. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T" (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "s" (entropy).  

The graph includes several points and curves:  
- Point 0 is at the bottom left, labeled as "0, ambient".  
- Point 1 is connected to point 0 via an adiabatic reversible curve.  
- Point 2 is connected to point 1 via an isobaric curve labeled "2,5 isobar".  
- Point 3 is connected to point 2 via an adiabatic reversible curve.  
- Point 5 is connected to point 3 via an isobaric curve labeled "0,191 isobar".  
- Point 6 is connected to point 5 via an adiabatic reversible curve.
