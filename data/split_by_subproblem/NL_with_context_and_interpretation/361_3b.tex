\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).  
From external forces, the same forces apply internally.  

\( T_{g,2} = T_{EW} = 0^\circ \, \text{C} \).  
Water internally transitions from ice to water and remains in the solid-liquid equilibrium region.  
No heat transfer occurs: \( T_{g,2} = T_{EW} \).
