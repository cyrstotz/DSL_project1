The vapor quality \(x_1\) directly after the expansion valve is calculated:  
\[
T_1 = T_i - 6K
\]  
A note mentions "adiabatic" for the transition from state 4 to state 1.  
A diagram is drawn with axes labeled "T" and "p," showing a point within a phase region.  
The formula for vapor quality is given:  
\[
x = (s_A - s_if) / (s_g - s_if)
\]  

Additional notes at the bottom:  
\[
q = 0, \quad T_m - T_c = 5 \text{K}
\]  
\[
T_m / T_c = s_{cx}
\]  
\[
\dot{m} = \dot{Q}_K / (h_{cx} - h_{cx})
\]
