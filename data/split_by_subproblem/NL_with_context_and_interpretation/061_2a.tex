A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points:  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 2 is slightly higher and to the right of Point 1, with a slanted line connecting them.  
- Point 3 is higher up, connected to Point 2 by a steep upward curve.  
- Point 4 is at the peak of the diagram, connected to Point 3 by a smooth curve.  
- Point 5 is lower and to the right of Point 4, connected by a downward curve.  
- Point 6 is at the bottom right, connected to Point 5 by a steep downward line.  

The axes are labeled:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T" (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "S" (entropy).  

Units for entropy are provided in a box: "kJ/kgÂ·K".
