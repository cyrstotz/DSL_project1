Exergy loss equals reference temperature times entropy production.  

Entropy balance:  
Zero equals mass flow rate times entropy at exit minus entropy at inlet plus sum of heat transfer divided by temperature plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals mass flow rate times entropy at inlet minus entropy at exit minus heat transfer divided by temperature.  

Exergy loss equals reference temperature times mass flow rate times entropy at inlet minus entropy at exit minus heat transfer divided by temperature.
