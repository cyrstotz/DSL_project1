\( p_{g2} = p_{g1} = 1.80094 \, \text{bar} \)  

The pressure does not change because the system is closed and the same external pressure still prevails.  

It holds \( T_{g2} = T_{EW} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

There is still ice (\( T < 0^\circ \text{C} \)) and no heat exchange takes place anymore.
