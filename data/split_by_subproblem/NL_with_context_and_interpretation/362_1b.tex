Entropy production:  
Entropy production equals integral of reversible entropy minus entropy of the cooling jacket.  

Entropy production equals:  
Integral of reversible entropy divided by temperature multiplied by (T2 minus T1) divided by natural logarithm of T2 divided by T1.  

Entropy production equals 233.12 kilojoules per kelvin.
