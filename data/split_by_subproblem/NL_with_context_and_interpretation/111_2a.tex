A T-s diagram is drawn with the following elements:  

- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" for temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "S [kJ/kg·K]" for entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.  
- Several curved lines are drawn, representing isobars (constant pressure lines), and one of them is explicitly labeled "Isobare."  
- The diagram includes points labeled "1," "2," and "3," connected by solid lines to indicate the process path.  
- The label "η_s = 1/4" appears near one of the process paths.  
- The label "v_nc" is written near another part of the diagram.  

The diagram visually represents thermodynamic processes qualitatively.
