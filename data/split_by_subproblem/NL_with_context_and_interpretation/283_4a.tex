A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis labeled in bar and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis labeled in degrees Kelvin (Â°K). The graph depicts a curve resembling a phase diagram with a peak. There is a shaded region at the top of the curve, indicating a phase transition or critical point.
