a) The temperature does not need to increase during a steady-state flow process.  

Q equals m_in multiplied by (h_in minus h_out) plus Q_R plus Q_out.  

Q_out equals m_in multiplied by (h_out minus h_in) minus Q_R.  

Boiling liquid is assumed to be pure water.  

h_out equals h_fg at 100 degrees Celsius, which equals 2257.0 kilojoules per kilogram (from water tables A-2).  

m_in equals 0.3 kilograms per second.  

h_in equals h_fg at 70 degrees Celsius, which equals 2333.8 kilojoules per kilogram (from water tables A-2).  

Q_R equals 100 kilowatts.  

Q_out equals negative 123.04 kilowatts.
