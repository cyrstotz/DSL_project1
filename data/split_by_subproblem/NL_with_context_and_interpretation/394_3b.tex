\( T_{g,2}, p_{g,2} \)  

State 1 and 2 are in thermodynamic equilibrium. The membrane is heat-conducting and isolated. It follows that \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} \).  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is equal to \( p_{g,1} \), as no change in the force balance occurs. This is due to the equal density of water and ice and the constant volume.  

\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \)  

\( \Delta E = Q - W \)  

\( m_{\text{EW}} \cdot c_{\text{EW}} \cdot (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) + m_g \cdot c_g \cdot (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1}) = 0 \)  

Since the EW mixture in the cylinder is not yet fully melted, the temperature must remain at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) until all ice has melted, as this is the phase transition temperature.
