R equals universal gas constant divided by molar mass equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole Kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

p gas equals p ambient plus F piston divided by A plus F EW divided by A.  
p ambient equals 1 times 10 to the power of 5 Newtons per square meter.  
F piston equals 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by (pi divided by 4 times diameter squared).  
F EW equals 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by (pi divided by 4 times diameter squared).  
p gas equals 1.401 times 10 to the power of 5 Newtons per square meter equals 1.4 bar.  

p times V equals n times R times T.  
n equals p times V divided by R times T gas,1.  
m gas equals p ambient times V gas,1 divided by R times T gas,1.  
m gas equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 Newtons per square meter times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times 773.15 Kelvin.  
m gas equals 3.419 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms equals 3.42 grams.
