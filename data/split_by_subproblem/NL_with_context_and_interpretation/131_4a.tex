A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis. The graph includes labeled regions and processes:  
- A horizontal line labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point).  
- Below the triple point, the region is labeled "subl. unter Tripelpkt." (sublimation below triple point).  
- A process labeled "isobar" (isobaric) is shown as a horizontal line.  
- Another process labeled "isotherm" (isothermal) is shown as a vertical line.  
- Points 1, 2, and 3 are marked on the graph, with arrows indicating transitions between them.
