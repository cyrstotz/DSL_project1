T2 equals negative 22 degrees Celsius, x2 equals 4.  
p2 equals 7.160 bar, equals p1.  
h2 from Table A10 equals 0.1580 cubic meters per kilogram.  
p3 equals p4 equals 8 bar.  
x0 equals 0.  

O equals m-dot multiplied by [h1 minus h2] plus Q-dot-u.  

hq equals h1, due to the throttle.  
hq1 from Table equals 0.89541 plus 10 to the power of 3 cubic meters per kilogram.  

p1 equals 7.160 bar.  
h1 equals 0.89541 multiplied by 10 to the power of 3 cubic meters per kilogram.  

x equals h1 minus hf divided by hg minus hf.  

hf at (7.160 bar) equals (7.160 minus 7 bar) divided by (7.2 bar minus 7 bar) multiplied by hf (7.2 bar) minus hf (7 bar) plus hf (7 bar).  

hg at (7.160 bar) equals (7.160 bar minus 7 bar) divided by (7.2 bar minus 7 bar) multiplied by hg (7.2 bar) minus hg (7 bar) plus hg (7 bar).
