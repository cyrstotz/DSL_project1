A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn. The diagram includes labeled points and regions:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as 'p' (pressure).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
- A curve is drawn, representing phase transitions, with a marked 'Triple' point.  
- Three states are labeled:  
  - State 1: Beginning condition.  
  - State 2: After step (i), following cooling.  
  - State 3: After step (ii), following isothermal pressure reduction.  
- The regions are labeled as 'Fen' (solid phase), 'Fl√ºssig' (liquid phase), and 'Gas' (gas phase).  
- Arrows indicate transitions between states, with annotations such as 'isobar' and 'isotherm'.
