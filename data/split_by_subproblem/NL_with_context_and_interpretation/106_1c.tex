Ṡ_erz equals summation of heat flow rate divided by temperature equals Q̇_out divided by T̄_KF plus Q̇_out divided by T_Reactor.  
Ṡ_erz equals 0.06049 kilowatts per kelvin.  
Diagram: Reactor with heat flow Q̇_out at T̄_KF equals 105 degrees Celsius transferring through the wall to the coolant (KF).
