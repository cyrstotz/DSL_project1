A graph is drawn with axes labeled as pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes three points labeled as 1, 2, and 3.  
- Point 1 is at the top right.  
- Point 2 is directly below point 1.  
- Point 3 is to the left of point 2.  
Two horizontal lines are marked:  
- One labeled "p triple" (triple point pressure).  
- Another labeled "p prop = 5 mbar" (pressure at 5 mbar).

Directly adiabatic → U4 equals U1  
Isobaric condensation → p4 equals p3 equals 8 bar  

U4 equals U3 equals Ug (specific value) equals 0.0255 kilojoules per kilogram
