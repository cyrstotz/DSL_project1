Zero equals negative Delta ex_str plus (1 minus T_0 divided by T) multiplied by Q dot divided by m_ges minus w dot divided by m_ges multiplied by ex_vel.  

(1 minus T_0 divided by T) multiplied by Q dot divided by m_ges equals 159.073 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Q dot divided by m_ges equals 189.89 kilojoules per kilogram.  

m_K equals 5.293.  

m_K equals m_ges minus m_K divided by (5.293 plus 1) equals m_ges divided by 6.293.  

ex_vel equals negative Delta ex_str plus (1 minus T_0 divided by T) multiplied by Q dot divided by m_ges equals 250.286 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Equals 57.886 kilojoules per kilogram.
