A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as 's' (entropy), and the vertical axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
- State points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- State 0 is labeled with '-30Â°C' and 'komp.init'.  
- State 2 has 'p2 = p3'.  
- State 3 has 'p4 < p3'.  
- State 4 has 'p4 = p5'.  
- State 5 is labeled with '0.5 bar' and '431.9 K'.  
- State 6 is labeled with '0.191 bar'.  
- Processes between states are labeled as 'adi.rev' (adiabatic reversible) and 'isochor' (isobaric).
