A table is drawn with columns labeled \( T \) and \( S \). Rows are numbered from 0 to 6:  
- Row 1: \( < p_c \)  
- Row 2: \( S_2 = S_1 \)  
- Row 3: \( > T_2 \)  
- Row 5: \( 0.5 \, \text{bar}, \, 431.9 \, \text{K} \)  
- Row 6: \( S_5 = S_6 \)  

A graph is drawn with \( T \, [\text{K}] \) on the y-axis and \( S \, [\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}] \) on the x-axis.  
The graph includes labeled points:  
- Point 1: Isentrope  
- Point 2: Isobar  
- Point 3: Isotherm  
- Point 4: Isobar  
- Point 5: Isobar  
- Point 6: Isentrope  
The graph also includes a note: "Steiler als isobar" (steeper than isobar).
