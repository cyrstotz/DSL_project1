A T-s diagram is drawn with temperature (T) on the y-axis and entropy (s) on the x-axis. The diagram includes labeled isobars:  
- \( p_0 = p_6 \)  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \)  
- \( p_5 = p_5 \)  

The states are marked as:  
- \( 0 \) at the bottom left corner.  
- \( 1 \) slightly above \( 0 \).  
- \( 2 \) higher up, connected to \( 3 \) by a vertical line.  
- \( 3 \) connected to \( 4 \) by a horizontal line.  
- \( 4 \) connected to \( 5 \) by a diagonal line.  
- \( 5 \) connected to \( 6 \) by a downward diagonal line.
