The pressure of the gas \( p_{g,1} \) is calculated as:  
\( p_{g,1} = m_{EW} g / A + m_K g / A + p_{amb} \)  
\( = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \)  

The ideal gas law is used:  
\( p V = m R T \)  

The gas mass \( m_g \) is determined as:  
\( m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_{g,1}}{R T_{g,1}} \)  
\( R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_g} = 0.76628 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)  
\( V_{g,1} = 3.14 \, \text{L} = 0.00314 \, \text{m}^3 \)  
\( T_{g,1} = 773.15 \, \text{K} \)  
\( m_g = 3.49 \, \text{g} \)  

The area \( A \) is calculated as:  
\( A = (\text{D}/2)^2 \pi = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2 \)
