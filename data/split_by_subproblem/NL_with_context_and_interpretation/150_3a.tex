R equals R divided by Mg equals 766.28 joules per kilogram Kelvin equals 0.766 joules per gram Kelvin.  

pg,1 equals (mEW times g divided by D squared times π) plus p0 plus (mK times g divided by D squared times π).  

Equals 1.4 bar.  

pg,1 times Vg,1 equals nG times R times Tg,1. Therefore, nG equals (pg,1 times Vg,1) divided by (R times Tg,1) equals 3.42 joules.
