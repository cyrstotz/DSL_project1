a) T-s  

A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 'S [kJ/kg·K]'. The graph shows several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left, marked as 'isentrop'.  
- Point 2 is connected to Point 1 via an upward curve labeled 'isentrop'.  
- Point 3 is connected to Point 2 via a horizontal line labeled 'isobar'.  
- Point 4 is connected to Point 3 via a downward curve labeled 'isentrop'.  
- Point 5 is connected to Point 4 via a horizontal line labeled 'isobar'.  
- Point 6 is connected to Point 5 via a downward curve labeled 'isentrop'.  

The graph also includes labels for pressures:  
- 'p2 = p3'  
- 'p0 low?'  
- 'p0 high?'  

Constants are written near the graph:  
- cp = 1.006  
- κ = 1.4  

Below the graph, a table is drawn with columns labeled 'T [K]' and 'p [bar]'. The rows are as follows:  
1. 288.15, 0.191  
2. Isentrop (crossed out)  
3. Isobar  
4. Isentrop  
5. 431.9, 0.5  
6. 314.48, 0.191
