1. First Law of Thermodynamics:  
Q equals m dot times (h_6 minus h_G minus (w_6 squared minus w_G squared) divided by 2).  

Exergy balance:  
0 equals minus delta exergy_loss plus (1 minus T_0 divided by T_B) times q_B minus exergy_loss.  

=> Exergy_loss equals (1 minus T_0 divided by T_B) times q_B minus exergy_loss_stream.  

=> (1 minus T_0 divided by T_B) times q_B minus exergy_loss_stream equals 844.11 kilojoules per kilogram.
