Exergy loss: Aircraft engine adiabatic.  
Exergy balance:  
G equals mass flow rate multiplied by exergy flow at state 0 minus mass flow rate multiplied by exergy flow at state 6 plus 0 minus 0 minus exergy loss.  

Plus mass flow rate multiplied by delta exergy flow minus exergy loss equals 0.  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals 100 kilojoules per kilogram.
