The pressure \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \), as the additional force due to the piston does not change, and the equilibrium remains unchanged.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},1} \), because the gas and the ice-water mixture (EW) are in thermodynamic equilibrium. Since the ice content \( x_{\text{Ice},2} > 0 \), the temperature cannot rise above the equilibrium temperature.
