Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream at state 6 minus exergy stream at state 0.  
This equals h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus kinetic energy.  
Kinetic energy equals w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2.  

This equals c subscript p multiplied by (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (c subscript p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 0)) plus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2.  

The term R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 0) equals zero.
