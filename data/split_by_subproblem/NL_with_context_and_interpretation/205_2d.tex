The equation for the mass-specific exergy loss is written as:  
Exergy loss = mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus ambient temperature multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0)) plus kinetic energy difference.  

An additional equation is provided:  
T̅ = T_B  
Exergy loss = heat transfer divided by T̅ multiplied by (1 minus ambient temperature divided by T̅) minus kinetic energy difference.  

The value for T̅ is given as:  
T̅ = 1000 Kelvin
