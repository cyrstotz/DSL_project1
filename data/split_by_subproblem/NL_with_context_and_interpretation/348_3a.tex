In equilibrium: hydrostatic.  

Surface area of the cylinder: A = pi times r squared = 7.85 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.  
Cylinder: r = d divided by 2.  

Perfect gas:  
p times V = m times R times T.  
p equals F divided by A.  

p sub g,1 equals p sub 0 plus m sub K times g divided by A plus m sub EW times g divided by A equals approximately 1.48 bar.  

R equals R divided by M equals 166.28 joules per kilogram per kelvin.  
m sub g equals p sub g,1 times V sub g,1 divided by R times T equals 3.429 kilograms.

Water is treated as incompressible → Volume of EW constant.  
Energy balance for EW:  

Delta E equals m multiplied by (u2 minus u1) equals Q.  

For EW: T_EW equals 0 degrees Celsius → Constant!  

x_ice equals m_ice divided by m_EW equals 0.6.  

u_EW constant.  

x_flüssig equals 1 minus x_ice equals 0.4.  

From Table 1: T_2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.
