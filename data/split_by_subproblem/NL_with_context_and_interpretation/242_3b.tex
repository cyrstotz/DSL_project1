P_g2 should remain constant because P_0 does not change and the mass of the surrounding remains constant.  
P_g2 equals 1.44 bar.  

T_g2: The water does not exchange additional energy with the gas for a fixed temperature difference, i.e., the gas adjusts itself accordingly. This is why the assumption applies:  
T_g2 equals 0 equals 0.0003 epsilon.
