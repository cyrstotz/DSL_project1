A diagram is drawn showing a T-s (temperature-entropy) graph with labeled isobars. The states are marked as follows:  
- State 0 at the bottom left.  
- State 1 higher up along the same isobar \( p_0 = p_1 \).  
- State 2 on a different isobar \( p_2 = p_3 \).  
- State 3 higher up along the same isobar \( p_2 = p_3 \).  
- State 4 on a descending curve.  
- State 5 on a different isobar \( p_5 \).  
- State 6 along the same isobar \( p_5 = p_6 \).  

The diagram includes dashed lines connecting the states and arrows indicating the direction of the process.
