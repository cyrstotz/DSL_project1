p equals pure reversible, therefore S-dot equals 0.  
Q equals m-dot multiplied by (s1 minus s2) plus Q-out divided by T-bar.  
T-bar equals m-dot multiplied by (s2 minus s1) plus Q-out.  

Q equals m-dot multiplied by (h1KF minus h2KF) plus Q-out.  

Negative Q-out divided by (h1KF minus h2KF) equals negative m-dot divided by e to the power of (T2 minus T1 divided by T1).  

T-bar equals 1 divided by Q-out multiplied by e to the power of (T2 divided by T1 minus 1).  

T-bar equals Q-out divided by e to the power of (T2 minus T1 divided by T1).  
T-bar equals 293.12 Kelvin.
