The pressure of the gas has not changed because no new components have been added that could exert additional pressure:  

\( p_{2,g} = p_{1,g} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \)  

If, in state 2, no heat is transferred between the gas and the ice-water mixture (EW), then there must be no temperature difference between the EW and the gas. This means:  

\( T_{2,g} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)
