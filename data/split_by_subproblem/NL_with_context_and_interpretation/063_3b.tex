The pressure \( p \) is calculated as:  
\( p = \frac{m \cdot R \cdot T}{V_2} \).  

The temperature \( T_a \) is:  
\( T_a = T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ \, \text{C} \).  

The thermodynamic equilibrium is described as:  
\( p_2 = p_1 = 1.9 \, \text{bar} \), as \( p \) remains constant throughout the process.
