A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a dome-shaped curve representing phase regions.  

Below, another graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. It includes labeled points:  
- Point 1  
- Point 2  
- Point 4  
- A line labeled "Tripel" (Triple point)  
- A region labeled "Phasengebiet" (Phase region)
