The equation for energy balance is written:  
dE/dt = 0 = ṁ (h0 - h6) + (w0 squared - w6 squared) / 2 + qB/ṁK + W.  

Another equation is written:  
0 = ṁ cp (T0 - T6) + (w0 squared - w6 squared) / 2 = -qB/ṁK.

The energy balance equation is written as:  
dE/dt = 0 = ṁ (h₀ - h₆ + (w₆ squared - w₀ squared) divided by 2) + q_B - W  

Rearranging for w₆:  
w₆ = square root of [2 * (h₀ - h₆ + q_B) + w₀ squared]  

Further substitution:  
w₆ = square root of [2 * (cp * (T₀ - T₆) + q_B) + w₀ squared]  

Values provided:  
q_B = 1195 kJ/kg  
T₀ = 243.15 K  
T₆ = ...  
w₀ = 200 m/s  

A diagram of a nozzle is drawn with labels "b" and "r".  

Entropy balance equation:  
0 = ṁ (s₆ - s₀) + Q̇/T₀, adiabatic  

For an isentropic process:  
s₆ - s₀ = 0 = cp ln(T₆/T₀) - R ln(p₆/p₀)  

Rearranging for T₆:  
T₆/T₀ = (p₆/p₀) raised to the power of (n-1)/n  

T₆ = T₀ * (p₆/p₀) raised to the power of (n-1)/n  

Substituting values:  
T₆ = T₀ * (p₆/p₀) raised to the power of (1.4-1)/1.4 = 328.1 K  

w₆ = 20
