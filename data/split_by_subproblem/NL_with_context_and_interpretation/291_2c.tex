Delta exergy flow equals exergy flow at state 6 minus exergy flow at state 0.  
Delta exergy flow equals [enthalpy at state a minus enthalpy at state e minus T_0 multiplied by (entropy at state a minus entropy at state e) plus change in kinetic energy plus change in potential energy].  
This equals [enthalpy at state s minus enthalpy at state 0 minus T_0 multiplied by (entropy at state s minus entropy at state 0) plus (velocity at state 6 squared minus velocity at state 0 squared) divided by 2].  
This equals [specific heat capacity multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 multiplied by (specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0)) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at state 0)] plus (velocity at state 6 squared minus velocity at state 0 squared) divided by 2.  
Pressure at state 0 equals pressure at state 0 (given value).  

Delta exergy flow equals negative 260.99 kilojoules per kilogram.
