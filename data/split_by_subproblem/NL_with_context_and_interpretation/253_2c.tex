Delta ex subscript str equals (h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus Delta ke).  
Equals (c subscript p multiplied by (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (c subscript p multiplied by ln(T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) minus R multiplied by ln(p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 0)) plus Delta ke).  
Plus Delta ke equals (w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2).  

Approximately equals 125.97 kilojoules per kilogram.
