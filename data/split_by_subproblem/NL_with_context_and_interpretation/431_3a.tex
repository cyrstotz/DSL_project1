The equation for pressure is derived as follows:  
\( p_{g,1} = p_0 + \frac{m_K g}{A} \), where \( A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} = \frac{\pi}{400} \, \text{m}^2 \).  
Substituting values:  
\( p_{g,1} = p_0 + \frac{m_K g}{A} = 1.46 \, \text{bar} \).  

The ideal gas law is applied:  
\( pV = mRT \).  
The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\( R = \frac{R_u}{M} = \frac{8314 \, \text{J/mol·K}}{50 \, \text{kg/kmol}} = 166.28 \, \text{J/kg·K} \).  

The mass of the gas \( m_g \) is determined:  
\( m_g = \frac{p_{g,1} V_1}{R T_1} = \frac{3.62 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kg}}{1} = 3.62 \, \text{g} \).
