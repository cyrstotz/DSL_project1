Exergy loss: Continue calculation with 100 kilojoules per kilogram for Delta exergy.  

Exergy loss equals negative Delta exergy plus (1 minus T0 divided by T) multiplied by q.  

Values:  
T0 equals 243.15 Kelvin.  
T equals 1289 Kelvin.  
q equals 1195 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Note: Only the heat q is transferred to 1 divided by (1 plus 5.293).  

Final calculation:  
Exergy loss equals negative Delta exergy plus (1 minus T0 divided by T) multiplied by q divided by (1 plus 5.293).  

Result:  
Exergy loss equals 54.073 kilojoules per kilogram.
