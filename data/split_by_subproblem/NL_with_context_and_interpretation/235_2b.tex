Energy balance for the entire turbine:  
The equation is written as:  
dE/dt = Σṁi (hi + ke + pe) + ΣQj - Σṁn.  

The terms "ke" and "pe" are crossed out, indicating they are negligible. The term "adiabat" is written above the equation, suggesting the process is adiabatic.  

The simplified equation becomes:  
0 = ṁges (h6 - h0) + (w0 squared - w6 squared) / 2.  

From Point 5 to Point 6 (Isentropic process):  
Tb / T5 = (p6 / p5) raised to the power of (n - 1) / n.  

Tb = (p0 / p5) raised to the power of (n - 1) / n multiplied by T5.  

Tb = 328.07 Kelvin.

w subscript 6 squared equals two times (h subscript 0 minus h subscript 6) plus w subscript 0 squared.  
w subscript 0 equals w subscript Luft.  
T subscript 0 equals 273.15 Kelvin.  

w subscript 6 equals the square root of two times (h subscript 0 minus h subscript 6) plus w subscript 0 squared.  

w subscript 6 equals the square root of two times the integral from T subscript 0 to T subscript 6 of c subscript p,Luft dT plus w subscript 0 squared.  

w subscript 6 equals the square root of two times c subscript p,Luft times (T subscript 0 minus T subscript 6) plus w subscript 0 squared.
