The temperature of the gas in state 2 is:  
\( T_{g,2} = T_{EW,1} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  
Explanation: Since the ice does not completely melt, the temperature of the ice-water mixture (EW) remains constant. Additionally, as the EW and the gas are in equilibrium, they share the same temperature.  

The pressure of the gas in state 2 is:  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.1 \, \text{bar} \)  
Explanation: The external load on the membrane does not change (same mass and same atmospheric pressure), so the gas pressure remains constant.
