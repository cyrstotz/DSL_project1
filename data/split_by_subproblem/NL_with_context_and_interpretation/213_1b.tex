TdS equals SQ.  

T multiplied by (s2 minus s1) equals q12.  

a12 equals h2 minus h1.  

T equals (h2 minus h1) divided by (s2 minus s1).  

h2 minus h1 equals c multiplied by f multiplied by (T2 minus T1).  

s2 minus s1 equals c multiplied by f multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T2 divided by T1).  

Therefore, T equals (T2 minus T1) divided by the natural logarithm of (T2 divided by T1) equals 283.1216 Kelvin.
