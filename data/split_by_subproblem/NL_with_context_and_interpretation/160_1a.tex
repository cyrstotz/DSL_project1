a) Steady-state flow process  

0 equals m dot times (s_a minus s_e) plus Q dot divided by T plus S dot_erz.  
0 equals m dot times (h_e minus h_a) plus Q dot_out minus W dot_0, which is zero because it is stationary.  

Q dot_out equals m dot times (h_a minus h_e).  

h_a minus h_e equals c_if times (T_a minus T_e) plus u squared divided by 2 plus (p_2 minus p_1) divided by rho.  
p_2 equals p_a.  

[Diagram]  
A rectangular diagram showing T_KF,e and T_KF,a with Q dot_out labeled.  

Q dot_out equals m dot times c_if times (T_KF,a minus T_KF,e).
