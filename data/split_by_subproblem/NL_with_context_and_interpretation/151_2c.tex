Delta exergy flow equals exergy flow at state 6 minus exergy flow at state 0.  

Delta exergy flow equals h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus kinetic energy.  

h subscript k equals h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus kinetic energy.  

This equals c subscript p multiplied by (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2.  

T subscript 0 equals 293 Kelvin.  
T subscript 6 equals 328.07 Kelvin.  

s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0 equals integral from T subscript 1 to T subscript 2 of c subscript p divided by T dT minus R multiplied by ln(p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 0).  

ln(p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 0) equals 1, ln(1) equals 0.  

This equals c subscript p multiplied by ln(T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) minus R multiplied by ln(p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 0).  

R equals c subscript p minus c subscript v, which equals c subscript p divided by kappa, which equals 0.2874.  

c subscript v equals c subscript p divided by kappa.  

This leads to s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0 equals 6.302.  

Delta exergy flow equals 1.006 multiplied by (328.07 minus 293) minus 293 multiplied by 0.302 plus 328.07 squared divided by 2.  

This equals 26974.037 joules per kilogram.
