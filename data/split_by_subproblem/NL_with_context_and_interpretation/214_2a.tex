A T-s diagram is drawn with temperature (T) on the vertical axis labeled in Kelvin (K) and entropy (s) on the horizontal axis labeled in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K). The diagram includes labeled points: 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6. Dashed lines represent isobars, and the region is labeled "Isobars."
