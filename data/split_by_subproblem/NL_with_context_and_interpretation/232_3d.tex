phi equals q_EW plus x_2 multiplied by (phi_g minus phi_f).  

u_2 equals u_2f plus x_2 multiplied by (u_2g minus u_2f).  

T_EW equals 0 degrees Celsius.  

x_2 equals u_2 minus u_2f divided by u_2g minus u_2f.  

x_2 equals negative 3047.093 minus negative 0.045 divided by negative 333.458 minus negative 0.045.  

x_2 equals 0.913.  

m_EW multiplied by (u_2 minus u_1) equals Q_12.  

u_1 equals u_1f plus x_1 multiplied by (u_1g minus u_1f).  

u_1 equals negative 0.045 plus 0.6 multiplied by (negative 333.458 minus negative 0.045).  

u_1 equals negative 200.093.  

u_2 equals Q_12 divided by m_EW plus u_1.  

u_2 equals negative 2847 divided by 0.1 plus negative 200.093.  

u_2 equals negative 3047.093 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Boxed note: u_g equals u_fest.
