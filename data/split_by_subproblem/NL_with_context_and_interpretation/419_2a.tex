A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" (entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  

The diagram includes several points labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, connected by curves and lines:  
- Point 1 to Point 2 is labeled "isentrop".  
- Point 2 to Point 3 is labeled "isobar".  
- Point 3 to Point 4 is labeled "isobar".  
- Point 4 to Point 5 is labeled "isobar".  
- Point 5 to Point 1 is labeled "isentrop".  

The isobars are marked as \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_4 = p_5 \), and \( p_5 = p_0 \).
