A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph shows three points labeled "1", "2", and "3", connected by curves. The curve between points "1" and "2" is steep, while the curve between points "2" and "3" is less steep. The graph includes isobar lines labeled "isobar p".
