A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]'.  

The diagram includes six states labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- A curve connects states 0, 1, 2, and 3, labeled as 'rotor'.  
- A horizontal line connects states 5 and 6, labeled as 'drive line'.  
- Another curve connects states 3, 4, and 5, labeled as 'rotor'.  
- The region between states 5 and 6 is shaded in blue.
