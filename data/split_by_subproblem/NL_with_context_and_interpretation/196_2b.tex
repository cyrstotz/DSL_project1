w6 = ?  
T6 = ?  

w5 = 200 meters per second, p5 = 0.5 bar, T5 = 431.9 Kelvin, p6 = p0 = 0.191 bar.  

Energy balance equation:  
0 = ṁ (se - sa) + Q̇ / ṁ + se / 2 = 0 (adiabat, irreversible).  

se - sa  

Polytropic temperature ratio:  
n = 1.4  

T2 divided by T1 equals (p2 divided by p1) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

T6 equals T5 multiplied by (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

T6 = 431.9 Kelvin multiplied by (0.191 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4).  

T6 = 328.07 Kelvin.  

Energy balance:  
0 equals ṁ (he minus ha) plus w6 squared minus w5 squared divided by 2.  

0 equals he minus ha plus w6 squared divided by 2 minus w5 squared divided by 2.  

w6 squared equals 2 multiplied by (he minus ha) plus w5 squared.

\( h_e - h_a \)  
\( h_5 - h_0 = c_p \cdot (431.9 \, \text{K} - 328.07 \, \text{K}) \)  
\( c_p = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \)  
\( = 1.006 \cdot (431.9 - 328.07) \)  
\( = 104.498 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  

\( w_e = 220 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \)  

\( w_a = \sqrt{2.104.488 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} + \frac{(220 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}})^2}{100}} \)  
\( = \sqrt{2.104.488 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \cdot 1000 + (220 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}})^2} \)  
\( = 507.294 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \)
