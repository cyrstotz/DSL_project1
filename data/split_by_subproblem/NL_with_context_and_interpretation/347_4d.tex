\( W_{23} / \dot{m} = ? \)  
This cannot be calculated because no polytropic process is present.  

A small arrow labeled "R134a" is drawn at the bottom right.

\( \varepsilon_c = \frac{|Q_{zu}|}{|W_{k}|} = \frac{|Q_{1}|}{W_{k}} \).  

From energy balance around the isobaric evaporator:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_k - W_k \).  

Thus, \( \varepsilon_c = \frac{\dot{m} (h_2 - h_1)}{W_k} \).
