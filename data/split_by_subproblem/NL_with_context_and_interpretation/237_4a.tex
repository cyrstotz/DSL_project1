Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with a shaded region. The axes are labeled as 'p' (pressure) and 'T' (temperature).  
2. The second diagram is another p-T graph showing phase regions labeled as 'Fl√ºssig' (liquid), 'Nass-dampf' (wet vapor), and 'Gas' (gas). Points are marked as 1, 2, 3, and 4 along the curve.
