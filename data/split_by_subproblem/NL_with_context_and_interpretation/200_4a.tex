A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'p (mbar)'.  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'T (°C)'.  
- Three phase regions are marked: 'Fest' (solid), 'Flüssig' (liquid), and 'Gas' (gas).  
- An isobaric line is drawn at 5 mbar.  
- Two isothermal processes are labeled: one at 10K below the sublimation point and another at the sublimation point.  
- Points 1, 2, and 3 are marked on the diagram, with arrows indicating transitions between states.
