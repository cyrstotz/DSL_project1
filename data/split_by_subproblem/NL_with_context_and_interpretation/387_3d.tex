\( Q_{\text{out,max}} = m_E (u_f(145) - u_i(145)) = -20 \, \text{kJ} \)  

Less heat \( Q \) is transferred to the ice-water mixture as \( T_{g,2} \) approaches 0째C. The temperature stabilizes at 0째C as the equilibrium is reached.  

\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.60015 \, \text{bar} \)

\( x_{\text{Eis},2} \):  

\( - m_{\text{EW}} \cdot 0.6 \cdot U_{\text{fest}}(R_2) + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot x_{\text{Eis},2} \cdot U_{\text{fest}}(R_2) + m_{\text{EW}} \cdot (1 - x_{\text{Eis},2}) \cdot U_{\text{fl체ssig}}(R_2) - Q_{1-2} \cdot m_{\text{EW}} \cdot U_{\text{fl체ssig}}(R_2) = Q_{1-2} - 0 \)

Q twelve equals m EW multiplied by zero point six multiplied by U ice plus zero point four multiplied by m EW multiplied by U water liquid minus m EW multiplied by U water liquid.  

m EW multiplied by U ice minus m EW multiplied by U water liquid equals delta m EW ice multiplied by p two.  

Q twelve equals delta m EW ice multiplied by delta U.  

Delta m EW ice equals C V divided by delta U equals negative zero point zero zero five eight kilograms, which equals five point eight grams.  

Zero point six minus zero point four minus delta m EW ice divided by zero point one equals zero point five four one five equals x EW ice two.
