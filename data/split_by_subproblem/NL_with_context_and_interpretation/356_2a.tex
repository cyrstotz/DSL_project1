A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and isentropic processes. The diagram includes points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The following processes are indicated:  
- Adiabatic and irreversible between points 4 and 3.  
- Isobaric between points 3 and 5.  
- Isentropic between points 1 and 2, and between points 5 and 6.  
The axes are labeled as follows:  
- Vertical axis: T [K].  
- Horizontal axis: S [J].  
A temperature value of 243.15 K is marked on the vertical axis.

Stationary process  

=> \( \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} (\Delta h + \frac{w_6^2 - w_5^2}{2}) + \sum \dot{Q}_j^0 - \sum \dot{W}_n^0 = 0 \)  

\( \Delta h = \frac{w_0^2 - w_5^2}{2} \)  

\( \Delta h = \int_{T_5}^{T_6} c_p dT = c_p (\ln(T_6) - \ln(T_5)) \)  

= -0.27 + 66024 kJ  

\( 0.27 + 66024 \cdot 2 + w_5^2 = w_6^2 = 48400.553 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \)  

=> \( w_6 = \)  

\( \Delta h = \int_{T_5}^{T_6} c_p dT = c_p (T_6 - T_5) = -104.442 \, \text{kJ} \)  

=> \( \Delta h \cdot 2 + w_5^2 = w_6^2 = 252294.912 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \)  

\( w_6 = 504.2454159 \, \text{m/s} \)
