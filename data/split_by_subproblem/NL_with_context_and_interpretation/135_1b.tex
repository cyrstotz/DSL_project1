(With Q out equals 65 kilowatts)  

T equals the integral of T dS from entropy at state a to entropy at state e.  

dH equals T dS plus V dp (isobaric).  
dS equals dH divided by T.  

The integral of dH equals the integral of c_p dT from temperature at state e to temperature at state a.  

This simplifies to:  
c_p times (temperature at state a minus temperature at state e) divided by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state a divided by temperature at state e).  

Calculation:  
c_p equals 2.94 times (298.15 minus 288.75) divided by the natural logarithm of (298.15 divided by 288.75).  

Result: T equals 293.72 Kelvin.
