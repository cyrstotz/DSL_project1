Ti equals 0 degrees Celsius.  

Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-volume (p-v) graph. It shows curves representing different states, with one labeled "nicht beachtet" (not considered).  
2. The second diagram is another pressure-volume (p-v) graph. It includes labeled regions:  
   - "gasförmig/flüssig" (gaseous/liquid)  
   - "flüssig/gasförmig" (liquid/gaseous)  
   - Points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4" are marked, forming a cycle.
