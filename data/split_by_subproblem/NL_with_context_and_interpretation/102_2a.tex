A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kg·K]'. The graph depicts a qualitative T-s diagram with several curves and points labeled.  
- Point '1' is at the bottom of the first curve.  
- Point '2' is higher up on the same curve.  
- Point '3' is on a separate curve above point '2'.  
- Point '4' is on a curve that connects back to point '1'.  
The curves are labeled as 'isobaric' and 'adiabatic' at different sections.
