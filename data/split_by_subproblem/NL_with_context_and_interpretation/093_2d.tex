Specific flow exergy balance:  
Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy six minus enthalpy zero minus temperature zero multiplied by (entropy six minus entropy zero)) plus heat flow KF plus potential energy plus summation of \( \xi \) multiplied by (one minus temperature zero divided by temperature i) multiplied by heat flow i minus summation of work flow in minus exergy loss.
