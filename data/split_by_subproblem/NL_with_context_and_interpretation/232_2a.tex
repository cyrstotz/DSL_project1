A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and process paths.  
- The x-axis is labeled as entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K).  
- The y-axis is labeled as temperature (T) in Kelvin (K).  
- The diagram includes points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The process from 1 to 2 is marked as adiabatic and isentropic.  
- The process from 2 to 3 is marked as isobaric.  
- The isobars are labeled as p1, p2 = p3, and p4 = p5.  
- The surrounding conditions are noted as \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) and \( T_0 = -30^\circ \text{C} \).
