Zero equals mass flow rate times (exergy at state 0 minus exergy at state 6) plus (1 minus T subscript 0 divided by T subscript B) times Q subscript B minus W subscript t minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals exergy at state 0 minus exergy at state 6 plus (1 minus T subscript 0 divided by T subscript B) times Q subscript B.  
Exergy loss equals 849.335 kilojoules per kilogram.
