The equation for pressure is written as:  
p v = R T / M_L  

The molar mass is given as:  
M_L = 28.52 kg/mol (Table A1)  

The first law of thermodynamics is applied:  
Q = mÌ‡ (h_5 - h_6 + w_6 squared minus w_5 squared divided by 2) + Q_B - W_T  

Simplified to:  
Q = h_5 - h_6 + w_6 squared minus w_5 squared divided by 2 minus R divided by M_L (T_6 - T_5) divided by 1 minus n  

The temperature T_0 is calculated as:  
T_0 = T_5 (p_0 divided by p_5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n) = 328.07 K  

The velocity w_6 is calculated using the equation:  
w_6 = square root of [2 c_p (T_5 minus T_6) + w_5 squared divided by 2 minus 2 R divided by M_L (T_6 minus T_5) divided by 1 minus n]  

The final velocity w_6 is left incomplete.
