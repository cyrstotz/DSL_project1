A equals pi times (D divided by 2) squared equals pi times (0.1 meters divided by 2) squared equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.  

F sub MK equals 38 kilograms times 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared equals 313.82 Newtons.  
F sub EW equals 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared equals 0.981 Newtons.  

P equals P sub amb plus F sub MK divided by A plus F sub EW divided by A equals 1.401 bar.  

m sub g: rho times V equals m times R times T implies m sub g equals rho times V divided by R times T equals M sub g times rho sub g times V sub g divided by D times T sub g equals 50 kilograms per kilomole times 1.401 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by R times 773.15 Kelvin equals 3.42 kilograms.
