The entropy production rate is written as:  
dS/dt equals Q divided by T plus S dot production.  
This simplifies to S dot production equals Q divided by T.  

S dot production equals negative 62.182 kilowatts divided by 295 kelvin.  
S dot production equals negative 210.786 joules per second per kelvin.
