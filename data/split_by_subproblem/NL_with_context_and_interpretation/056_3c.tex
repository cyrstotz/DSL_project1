The condition \( x_{\text{Ice},2} > 0 \) is stated.  

Initial values:  
\( x_{\text{Ice},1} = 0.6 \), \( m_{EW} = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \), \( T_{EW} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

The temperature of the gas decreases as heat flows into the EW. The pressure remains constant because the equilibrium depends on the external pressure.  

It is stated:  
"The equilibrium is now at a different point."
