A diagram of a circular system is drawn with arrows indicating flow at points labeled 1, 2, and 3. The following equations and annotations are written:  
- \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( T_2 = T_1 \)  
- \( \omega = \dot{m}_{R134a} (l_2 - l_3) - W_{k} \)  
- \( dE/dt = \sum_i \dot{m}_i (h_i + \frac{w_i^2}{2} + rps(i))^{o, \text{shutout}} + \sum \dot{Q}_i(t)^{o, \text{adiabatic}} - \sum \dot{W}_i(t)^{o, \text{adiabatic}} \)
