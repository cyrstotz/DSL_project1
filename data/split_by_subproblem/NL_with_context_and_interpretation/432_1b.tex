Thermodynamic mean temperature T KF:  
T KF = integral of T d s from s a to s e divided by integral of d s from s a to s e  

For an ideal fluid:  
d s = c p divided by T times d T  

Therefore,  
T d s = c p times d T  
Integral of T d s = c p times (T out minus T in)  

s a minus s e = c p times ln(T out divided by T in)  

T KF = (T out minus T in) divided by ln(T out divided by T in)  

Substituting values:  
T KF = (298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin) divided by ln(298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin)  
T KF approximately equals 9.66 Kelvin
