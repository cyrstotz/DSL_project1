Mass flow rate equation:  
m dot times (h two minus h three) plus Q dot minus W dot equals zero.  

Rearranged equation:  
m dot equals W dot divided by (h two minus h three).  

Entropy relation:  
s two equals s three.  

Crossed-out text:  
s three equals s two equals zero point nine zero zero six.
