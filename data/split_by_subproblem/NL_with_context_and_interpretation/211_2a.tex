A diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/K]' (entropy).  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'Temperature [K]'.  
The diagram shows a qualitative T-s process with labeled isobars and isentropic lines:  
- Points are marked as \( p_0 \), \( p_2 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_5 \).  
- The process includes isentropic and isobaric transitions.  
- The points are connected in sequence: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5.
