The equation for work is given as:  
Q equals m dot times (h6 minus h5) minus W dot.  

The temperature T6 is calculated as:  
T6 equals T5 times (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  
T6 equals 328.071 Kelvin.  

The reversible work W dot rev is calculated as:  
W dot rev equals m dot times cp times (T5 minus T6).  
W dot rev equals 109.45 kilowatts.  

Another equation for reversible work is given as:  
W dot rev equals the integral from 5 to 6 of v dp plus (w6 squared divided by 2 minus w5 squared divided by 2).  

This simplifies to:  
The integral from 5 to 6 of v dp equals minus n times the integral from 5 to 6 of v dv.  
This equals minus n divided by (n minus 1) times R times (T6 minus T5).  
This equals minus 104.45 kilowatts.  

Additional constants are provided:  
n equals cp divided by cv equals 1.4.  
cv equals 0.7186 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
R equals cp minus cv equals 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
