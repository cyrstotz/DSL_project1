A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the y-axis and entropy (s) on the x-axis. The graph represents the jet engine process qualitatively in a T-s diagram. Relevant isobars are labeled as follows:  
- \( p_0 = p_2 \)  
- \( p_5 = p_3 \)  
- \( p_6 = p_4 \)  

The states are marked:  
- State 0: \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}, T_0 = -30^\circ \text{C} \)  
- State 1: (no specific values provided)  
- State 2: (no specific values provided)  
- State 3: \( p_3 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- State 4: \( p_4 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- State 5: \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}, T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \)  
- State 6: \( p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}, T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K} \)
