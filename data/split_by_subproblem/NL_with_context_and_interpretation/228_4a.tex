A graph is drawn with pressure labeled as "P [bar]" on the vertical axis and temperature labeled as "T [K]" on the horizontal axis. The graph includes a curve representing phase regions. The triple point is marked on the curve, and two steps are labeled:  
- Step i: An arrow pointing leftward toward the curve.  
- Step ii: An arrow pointing upward from the triple point.

O equals mass flow rate of R134a times (h2 minus h3) plus work rate.  

Table A-11:  
hf (8.06 bar, x equals 0) equals 83.42 kilojoules per kilogram equals h4.  
Therefore, T4 equals 31.33 degrees Celsius.
