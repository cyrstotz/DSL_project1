0 equals m dot multiplied by the difference of s exit minus s inlet plus Q dot divided by T plus S entropy production.  

S entropy production equals negative Q dot divided by T plus m dot multiplied by the difference of s exit minus s inlet.  

Equals positive 37.187 divided by 295 plus 0.3 multiplied by [ ... ].  

Equals 9.022 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

S inlet equals 9.95 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
S exit equals 7.30 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
