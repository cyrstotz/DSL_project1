pV = mRT  

Force equilibrium on membrane:  
Area = pi times (0.05 meters squared) = 3.926 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters  
Fg = (32 kilograms times 10 meters per second squared) = 313.6 Newtons  

pg1 = pamb + delta Fg divided by Area = 1 bar + 1.5 bar = 2.5 bar  

pV divided by RT = m  
p2 = 8.314 joules per mole per kelvin divided by 0.1662 joules per kilogram per kelvin = 166.28 joules per kilogram per kelvin  

m_g = 1.7 times 10 to the power of negative 5 pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 773.15 kelvin times 166.28 joules per kilogram per kelvin = 4.6 times 10 to the power of negative 2 kilograms
