A graph is drawn with the axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  

The graph depicts a qualitative T-s diagram with six states labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- A dashed line connects states 2 and 3, labeled "p2 = p3".  
- Another dashed line connects states 5 and 6, labeled "0.5 bar".
