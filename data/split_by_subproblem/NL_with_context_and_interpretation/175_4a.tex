A graph is drawn with axes labeled as \( p \) (pressure) and \( T \) (temperature in degrees Celsius). The curve represents the phase boundary, and a point labeled "Trippel" (triple point) is marked on the curve. Two lines are drawn from the triple point: one labeled "isotherm" (isothermal) and the other labeled "isobar" (isobaric). The points "1" and "2" are marked along these lines.
