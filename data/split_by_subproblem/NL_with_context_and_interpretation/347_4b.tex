Cooling cycle:  
- Zustand 1 (State 1): \( p_1 \), \( x_1 \) indicates expansion.  
- Zustand 2 (State 2): \( p_2 = p_1 \), \( x = 1 \), meaning fully evaporated as gas.  
- Zustand 3 (State 3): \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \), \( x = 0 \), meaning fully condensed at 8 bar.  
- Zustand 4 (State 4): \( p_4 = p_3 \), \( x = 0 \), meaning fully condensed at 8 bar.  

\( T_a = -11 \, \text{°C}, \, p = 8 \, \text{bar} \)  
\( T_a = 3.1 \, \text{°C} \)  

\( T_i \) is 10K above the sublimation point of frozen water and slightly below the triple point.
