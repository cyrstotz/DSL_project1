Delta exergy of the stream equals (h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0)) plus one-half multiplied by m dot multiplied by w6 squared minus one-half multiplied by m dot multiplied by w0 squared.  

m dot equals...  
mK equals 5.293.  

m dot multiplied by 5.293. Delta exergy of the stream equals (cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0)) minus T0 multiplied by (cp multiplied by ln(T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by ln(p6 divided by p0)) plus (w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2).  

T6, w6 from solution:  
s exergy equals 14.413 kilojoules per kilogram plus 110.050 kilojoules per kilogram equals 264.18 kilojoules per kilogram.
