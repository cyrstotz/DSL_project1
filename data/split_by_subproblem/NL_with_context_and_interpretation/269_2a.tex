A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars. The diagram includes the following points:  
- Point 2 labeled as "p pre-compressor".  
- Point 5 labeled as "p5".  
- Point 6 labeled as "p6 = p0".  
The axes are labeled:  
- The x-axis is entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram (kJ/kg).  
- The y-axis is temperature (T) in Kelvin (K).
