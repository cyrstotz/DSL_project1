Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram.  
   - It includes labeled points: 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - The triple point is marked.  
   - The regions are shaded to indicate phase boundaries.  

2. The second diagram is also a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram.  
   - It includes labeled points: 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - The triple point is marked.  

Below the diagrams:  
- \( T_i = 5^\circ \text{C} \)  
- Point labels:  
  - 1: \( p_2 = p_4 \)  
  - 2: \( p_2 = p_1 \), \( x_2 = 1 \)  
  - 3: \( 8 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - 4: \( 6 \, \text{bar} \), \( x = 0 \)  
- \( w = 28 \, \text{m/s} \)
