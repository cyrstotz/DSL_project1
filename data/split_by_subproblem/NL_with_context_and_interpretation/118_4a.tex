A table is presented with columns labeled T, p (bar), v, u, and s. The rows contain the following data:  
- z1: T = 6°C, p = 1, s1 = s2  
- z2: T = -6°C, p = 1, u = 243.72, s2 = 0.9226  
- z3: T = 8°C, p = 8, s3 = s2  
- z4: T = 8°C, p = 8  

Below the table:  
Ti = 0°C → T(z2) = -6°C  

A graph is drawn with axes labeled T (K) on the vertical axis and s (kJ/kg·K) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a phase diagram with regions labeled "Fest" (solid), "mass dampf gebiet" (mass vapor region), and "dampf-gasförmig" (vapor-gaseous). Points z1, z2, z3, and z4 are marked on the graph, connected by lines to indicate transitions between phases.
