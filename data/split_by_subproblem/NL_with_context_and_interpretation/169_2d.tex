Summation of ex_str equals summation of h minus T_c multiplied by summation of s multiplied by summation of Q_dot minus summation of W_dot_in minus summation of ex_verl.  
ex_verl equals T_c multiplied by summation of s_verl.  
s_verl equals negative 6 divided by 7 kilograms.  
C equals negative Delta ex_str plus summation of (1 minus T_c divided by T) multiplied by Q_dot minus summation of W_dot_in minus ex_verl.  
e_xiverl equals negative Delta ex_str equals negative 207.48 kilojoules per kilogram.
