T KF: Entropy balance around KF:  

P KF equals P KF ein equals isobar equals reversible.  
L p Serz equals zero.  

O equals m dot KF times (s e minus s a) plus negative Q dot aus divided by T KF.  

O equals m dot KF times c i KF times ln(T e divided by T a) minus Q dot aus divided by T KF.  

L dot m KF: Energy balance around KF:  

O equals m dot KF times (h e minus h a) minus Q dot aus.  

m dot KF equals Q dot aus divided by (h e minus h a).  

m dot KF equals Q dot aus divided by c i KF times (T e minus T a).  

O equals Q dot aus divided by c i KF times ln(T e divided by T a) minus Q dot aus divided by T KF.  

Q dot R divided by (T e minus T a) times ln(T e divided by T a) minus Q dot aus divided by T KF.  

Q dot aus divided by (Q dot R divided by (T e minus T a) times ln(T e divided by T a)) equals m dot KF equals 243.12 Kelvin.
