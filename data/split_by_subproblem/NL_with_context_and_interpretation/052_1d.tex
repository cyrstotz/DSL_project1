Half-open system:  
Delta E equals delta m times h two plus Q R two plus Q out two.  

m two times h two minus m one times h one equals delta m times h two.  

Therefore, delta m equals m two times h two minus m one times h one divided by h two.  

h at 100 degrees Celsius equals u at 100 degrees Celsius plus x zero times (u g minus u f), which equals 429.372 kilojoules per kilogram.  
h at 20 degrees Celsius equals u at 20 degrees Celsius plus x zero times (u g minus u f), which equals 303.368 kilojoules per kilogram.  

m two equals m one plus delta m two.  
h two equals h one plus delta h two, which equals 126.06 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Therefore, delta m two equals (m two times h two minus m one times h one) divided by h two.  

Delta m two plus m two times h two divided by h two equals m two minus m one divided by h two equals delta m two times (1 plus h one divided by h two).  

Delta m two equals m two times h two minus h one divided by h two times (1 plus h one divided by h two), which equals 5680 kilograms.
