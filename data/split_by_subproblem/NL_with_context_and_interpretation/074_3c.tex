Delta T equals five hundred degrees Celsius minus zero degrees Celsius equals five hundred Kelvin.  

u at T2 minus u at T1 equals the integral from T1 to T2 of c sub v as a function of T dT.  

Equals (T2 minus T1) times c sub v as a constant.  

Equals five hundred Kelvin times zero point six three three kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin equals three hundred sixteen point five kilojoules per kilogram equals q.  

Q12 equals q times m equals three hundred sixteen point five kilojoules per kilogram times zero point zero zero three six kilograms equals one point one four kilojoules.
