Delta exergy of the stream equals exergy of the stream at state 6 minus exergy of the stream at state 0. This is expressed as:  
h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0) plus w6 squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

h6 minus h0 equals cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0), which equals 719.608 kilojoules per kilogram.  

s6 minus s0 equals cp multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p6 divided by p0), which equals 0.927905 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

w0 squared divided by 2 equals 20 kilojoules per kilogram.  

w6 squared divided by 2 equals 1487.8 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals 1489.21 kilojoules per kilogram.
