If the cooling cycle in Step i continues unchanged and a constant heat flow \( \dot{Q}_K \) continues to be removed, the temperature inside the freeze dryer would decrease further. This is because the heat removal would exceed the sublimation heat required, leading to further cooling.

Ti equals 10 degrees Celsius.  
The temperature inside the freeze dryer during the process would no longer remain isothermal.
