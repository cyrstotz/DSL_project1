The page contains a graph labeled as part of Task 4a.  

The graph is a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram.  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'T [K]' (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'p' (pressure).  

The diagram includes the following elements:  
1. A curved line representing the phase boundary between solid and liquid states.  
2. A point labeled 'Tripol' (triple point), where the solid, liquid, and gas phases coexist.  
3. Two vertical arrows labeled 'i' and 'ii', indicating processes occurring at specific points along the diagram.  
4. The region above the curved line is labeled 'Fl√ºssig' (liquid).  
5. The region below the curved line is labeled 'Fest' (solid).
