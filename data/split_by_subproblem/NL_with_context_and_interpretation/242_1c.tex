Entropy production due to heat transfer:  
Heat flow out divided by mean temperature of coolant stream.  

Entropy production equals heat flow out divided by mean temperature of coolant stream minus heat flow out divided by reactor temperature plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals heat flow out divided by mean temperature minus heat flow out divided by reactor temperature.  
Reactor temperature equals isothermal mass evaporation temperature of 373.15 Kelvin.  

Entropy production equals 45.96 joules per Kelvin.
