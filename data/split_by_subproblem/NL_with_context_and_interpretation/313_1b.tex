The thermodynamic mean temperature \( \bar{T} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\bar{T} = \frac{\int_a^b T \, ds}{S_a - S_e}
\]  
This is equivalent to:  
\[
\bar{T} = \frac{\int_a^b dH \, \text{(isobar)}}{S_a - S_e} = \frac{h_e - h_a}{S_a - S_e}
\]  
Further simplification leads to:  
\[
\bar{T} = \frac{c_p \int_{T_1}^{T_2} dT}{c_p \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \frac{dT}{T}} = \frac{c_p (T_2 - T_1)}{c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)}
\]  
The final result is:  
\[
\bar{T} = 283.12 \, \text{K}
\]
