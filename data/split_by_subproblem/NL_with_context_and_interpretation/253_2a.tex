A temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram is drawn with labeled points representing the jet engine process.  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
- Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The process lines connect the points in sequence, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
- Isobars are labeled: \( p_1 = p_3 \) and \( p_4 = p_5 \).

Zero equals h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 plus w subscript 5 minus w subscript 6.  
Equals c subscript p, Luft multiplied by (T subscript 5 minus T subscript 6) plus w subscript 5 minus w subscript 6.  

Reversible, adiabatic subroutine:  
T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 5 equals (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 5) raised to the power of (1 minus 1 divided by kappa).  
Therefore, T subscript 6 equals (p subscript 0 divided by p subscript 5) raised to the power of (1 minus 1 divided by kappa) multiplied by T subscript 5 equals 328.07 Kelvin.  

h subscript 0 minus h subscript 6 equals negative 85.43 kilojoules per kilogram.  

w subscript 6 equals 510 meters per second.
