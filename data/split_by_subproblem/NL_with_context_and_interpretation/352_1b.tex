The thermodynamic mean temperature T_KF is calculated using the logarithmic mean temperature difference formula:  
T_KF equals (T_2 minus T_1) divided by the natural logarith of (T_2 divided by T_1).  

Substituting values:  
T_KF equals (298.15 minus 288.15) divided by ln(298.15 divided by 288.15), which equals 293.1 Kelvin.
