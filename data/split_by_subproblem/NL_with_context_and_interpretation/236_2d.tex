Exergy balance:  

Delta ex over delta t at steady state equals the summation of exergy flow rates plus the summation of heat flow rates minus the summation of work flow rates minus p zero times the derivative of volume with respect to time minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals exergy flow rate minus work flow rate (no external work).  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals exergy flow rate divided by mass flow rate. Therefore, exergy loss equals exergy flow rate, which equals one hundred kilojoules per kilogram.
