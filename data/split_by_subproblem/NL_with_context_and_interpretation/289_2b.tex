Equations and calculations are written to determine \( w_6 \) and \( T_6 \):  

1. \( w_6 = ? \)  
2. \( T_6 = ? \)  
3. \( s_5 = s_6 \)  
4. \( n = \kappa = 1.4 \) (isentrop)  

The following formulas are provided:  
- \( T_6 / T_5 = (p_6 / p_5)^{(n-1)/n} \)  
- \( T_6 = T_5 \cdot (p_0 / p_5)^{0.4/1.4} \)  
- \( T_6 = 328.076697 Â°C \)
