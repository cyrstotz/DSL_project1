\( p_g = p_{\text{EW}} \)  

\( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}} \)  

EW is incompressible, the pressure in EW does not change with \( x_{\text{EW}} \).  
\(\Rightarrow\) The pressure in the gas does not change either.  
\(\Rightarrow p_g = p_{\text{EW}} \, \text{and no change in gas} \, \Rightarrow T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW}} \).  

\( T_{g,2} = 0 \, \text{°C} \, \text{because EW and gas are in equilibrium (GG2)} \, \Rightarrow T_{\text{EW},2} = T_{g,2} \).  

\( T_{\text{EW},2} = 0 \, \text{°C because EW is at 0 °C, and it is a mixture of solid and liquid.} \)
