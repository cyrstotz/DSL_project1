A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as '[s]'. The graph depicts a qualitative T-s diagram for the jet engine process. The curve starts at point 1, rises to point 2, then sharply increases to point 3. From point 3, it gradually curves to point 4, then to point 5, and finally descends to point 6. The isobars are labeled, and the region between points 4 and 5 is marked as 'Reaktor'.
