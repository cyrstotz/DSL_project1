A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), and \( p_2 \). Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the diagram, connected by lines to represent the process. The x-axis is labeled as \( s \) (specific entropy in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)), and the y-axis is labeled as \( T \) (temperature).
