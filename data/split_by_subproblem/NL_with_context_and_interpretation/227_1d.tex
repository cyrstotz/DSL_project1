The change in energy over time is equal to the sum of mass flow rates multiplied by the specific enthalpy, kinetic energy, and potential energy at the inlet and outlet, plus the heat flow minus the work done:  
dE/dt = Σm_i(h_i + ke_i^0 + pe_i^0) + Q̇ - Ẇ  

This simplifies to:  
ΔE - m_2u_2 - m_1u_1 = Δm + Q - W  
(ke and pe are neglected)
