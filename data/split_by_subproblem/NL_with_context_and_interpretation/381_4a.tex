A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows phase regions labeled as "Fast," "Gas," "Triple," and "Fl√ºssig" (Liquid). Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked along the curve, corresponding to different states in the freeze-drying process.
