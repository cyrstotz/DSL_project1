The mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{R134a} \) is calculated using an energy balance for the evaporator:  
\[ 0 = \dot{m} [h_e - h_a] + \sum \dot{Q}_t,n - \sum \dot{W}_t,n \]  
Since the process is adiabatic, \( \dot{Q}_t,n = 0 \).  
\[ \dot{W}_t = 2.8 \, \text{W} = \dot{W}_k \]  

From the tables:  
\[ h_e = h_2 \]  
\[ h_u = h_3 = 261.95 \, \text{kJ/kg} \, \text{(A-11)} \]  

The pressure \( p_2 = p_1 \).  
Adiabatic throttling implies isenthalpy.  

The mass flow rate is given by:  
\[ \dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_{t,in}}{[h_a - h_e]} = \frac{2.8 \, \text{W}}{[h_3 - h_2]} \]
