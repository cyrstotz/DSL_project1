A graph is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled \( s \) (entropy).  
- The y-axis is labeled \( T \) (temperature).  

Three points are marked on the graph:  
1. Adiabatic (reversible) process from \( s_1 \) to \( s_2 \), \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \).  
2. Isobaric (irreversible) process from \( s_2 \) to \( s_3 \).  
3. Adiabatic (reversible) process from \( s_3 \) to \( s_4 \).
