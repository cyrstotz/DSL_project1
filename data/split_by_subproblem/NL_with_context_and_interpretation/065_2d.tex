Exergy loss equals T sub 0 multiplied by entropy production.  
Exergy loss equals T sub 0 multiplied by delta entropy of the engine minus T sub 0 multiplied by (s sub a minus s sub e) equals T sub 0 multiplied by (s sub c minus s sub 0) minus s superscript 0 of T sub c minus s superscript 0 of T sub 0 minus R multiplied by natural logarithm of (p sub c divided by p sub 0).  

Exergy loss equals 243.15 Kelvin multiplied by (1.7919 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 1.49111 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) minus R multiplied by natural logarithm of (p sub c divided by p sub 0).  

Exergy loss equals 73.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
