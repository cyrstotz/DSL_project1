A graph is drawn with pressure (p in bar) on the y-axis and temperature (T in degrees Celsius) on the x-axis. Two regions are labeled:  
- The region labeled "(i)" corresponds to freezing.  
- Another region is labeled "gas."  
A line labeled "test" is drawn between the two regions.

e_k equals Q_2a divided by (Q_0b minus Q_2a).
