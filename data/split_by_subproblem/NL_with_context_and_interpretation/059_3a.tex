A = pi times r squared  
r = 0.05 meters  
A = 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters  

Pk = F divided by A  
F = mK times g  
Pk = 32 times 9.81 divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3  
Pk = 39369.53 pascals  
Pk ≈ 0.399 bar  

Pew = mEW times g divided by A  
Pew = 0.1 times 9.81 divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3  
Pew ≈ 124.90 pascals  
Pew ≈ 0.0001249 bar  

Pg,1 = Pk + Pew + Pamb = 1.14 bar  

Pg times Vg divided by RT = m times RT divided by M  
mg = Pg times Vg times M divided by RT  
mg = 1.14 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters times 50 kilograms per kilomole divided by 8.314 times (500 + 273.15)  
mg = 0.818 grams
