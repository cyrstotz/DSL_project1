A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the y-axis labeled in bar and Pascal, and temperature (T) on the x-axis labeled in Kelvin. The graph shows phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). The critical point is marked on the curve separating the liquid and gas regions. The triple point is labeled where the solid, liquid, and gas phases meet. Arrows indicate processes: "isobar gefahren" (isobaric process), "isotherm druckabnahme" (isothermal pressure reduction), and "isotherm sublimation" (isothermal sublimation).
