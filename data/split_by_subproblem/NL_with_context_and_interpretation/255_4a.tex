Phase diagram test  

The diagram includes labeled regions such as "Triple," "Sublimation," "Cooling cycle," and various states (e.g., 1, 2). The diagram is heavily marked with arrows and lines connecting different points, representing transitions between phases.

A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p (mbar)" and the x-axis labeled as "T (K)". The graph shows three distinct regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). A curve is drawn, representing the phase boundary, with a point labeled "Tripel" (triple point) where the three phases meet. Two additional points are marked on the graph, connected by a vertical line and a horizontal line, labeled "kühlen abführen" (cooling removal).
