Second law of thermodynamics:  
Zero equals m multiplied by (se minus sa) plus Q dot divided by T plus S dot.  

S dot equals Q out divided by T KF minus Q out divided by T reactor.  

Q out equals 65 kilowatts divided by 293 Kelvin minus 65 kilowatts divided by 373 Kelvin.  

S dot equals 0.046 kilojoules per Kelvin.
