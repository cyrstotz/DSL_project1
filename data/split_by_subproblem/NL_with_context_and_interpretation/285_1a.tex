Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at the exit and enthalpy at the inlet plus heat flow out.  

Heat flow out equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at the exit and enthalpy at the inlet.  

The difference between enthalpy at the exit and enthalpy at the inlet equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the difference between temperature at the exit and temperature at the inlet.  

Specific enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius minus specific enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius equals 2626.9.  

Mass flow rate equals 0.3 kilograms per second.  

Temperature at the inlet equals 343.15 Kelvin.  

Temperature at the exit equals 373.15 Kelvin.  

Total mass equals 5755 kilograms.  

Temperature of the coolant at the inlet equals 288.15 Kelvin.  

Temperature of the coolant at the outlet equals 298.15 Kelvin.
