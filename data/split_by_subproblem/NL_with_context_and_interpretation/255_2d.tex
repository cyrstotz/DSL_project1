Stationary flow process  

\( \dot{ex}_{verl} = \Delta ex_{str} + \Delta ex_{iq} - \dot{w}_t \)  
\( \dot{w}_t \to 0 \), as the entire power of the turbine is used in the compressors!  

\( \Delta ex_{iq} = (1 - T_0 / T_B) \cdot q_B = 969.58 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

\( ex_{verl} = 7710.38 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)
