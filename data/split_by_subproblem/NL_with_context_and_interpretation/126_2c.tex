Delta exergy of the stream equals hc minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0) plus Delta ke.  

h0 minus h0 equals cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0) equals 1.006 multiplied by (328.07 minus (-30 plus 273.15)) equals 85.43 kilojoules per kilogram.  

T0 equals -30 plus 273.15 equals 243.15.  

s6 minus s0 equals cp multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p6 divided by p0).  

Equals 0.301 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Delta ke equals one-half multiplied by (w6 squared minus w0 squared) equals one-half multiplied by (560 squared minus 200 squared) equals 110050 joules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals 85.43 kilojoules per kilogram minus 243.15 multiplied by (0.301 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) plus 110050 multiplied by 10 to the power of negative 3 joules per kilogram.  

Equals 122.22 kilojoules per kilogram.
