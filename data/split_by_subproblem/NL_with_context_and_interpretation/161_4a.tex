A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled regions. The diagram includes the following:  
- A curve labeled "Dampf" (vapor) and another curve labeled "Fest" (solid).  
- The intersection of the curves is marked as "Triple".  
- Two steps are labeled: "i" and "ii".  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T (°C)" and the y-axis as "p (bar)".  
- The region below the curves is labeled "Dampf" (vapor), and the region above is labeled "Fest" (solid).  
- The area between the curves is labeled "Flüssig" (liquid).
