Freeze drying with an R134a cooling cycle.  

A diagram is drawn with a pressure-temperature (p-T) curve.  
- The curve includes labeled points:  
  - Point 1: "Dampf-Flüssig zweiphasiges Gebiet" (vapor-liquid two-phase region).  
  - Point 2: "Gas" (gas).  
  - Point 3: "Isobar p3 > 8 bar".  
  - Point 4: "Flüssig" (liquid).  
- The curve shows transitions between phases, with arrows indicating the direction of processes.  
- The diagram includes a labeled "adiabat" line.
