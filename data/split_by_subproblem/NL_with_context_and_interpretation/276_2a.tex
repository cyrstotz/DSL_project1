A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  

The diagram shows a jet engine process with the following labeled points and processes:  
- Point 0: Starting point.  
- Point 2: Isentropic process.  
- Point 3: Isobaric process.  
- Point 4: Isentropic process.  
- Point 5: Isobaric process with pressure \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- Point 6: Isentropic and reversible process.  

The transitions between points are marked as isentropic or isobaric processes, with arrows indicating the direction of the flow.
