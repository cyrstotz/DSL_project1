Delta exergy of the stream equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference of enthalpy at state 6 and state 0 minus the product of T0 and the difference of entropy at state 6 and state 0 plus the square of velocity at state 6 divided by 2.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals 12.158 kilojoules per kilogram plus velocity squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals 116.487 kilojoules per kilogram.
