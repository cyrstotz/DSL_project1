A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  

The diagram includes six states labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, connected by various lines:  
- A dashed line connects state 0 to state 1.  
- A vertical line connects state 1 to state 2.  
- A line labeled "Isobare p2 = p3" connects state 2 to state 3.  
- A line labeled "Isobare p4 = p5" connects state 4 to state 5.  
- A line labeled "Isobare p0" connects state 5 to state 6.
