Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a T-s diagram (temperature versus entropy).  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 'S (kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin)'.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'T (Kelvin)'.  
   - Several isobars are drawn as curves sloping downward to the right.  
   - Points labeled '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', and '5' are marked along the curves, representing different states in the process.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the process between states.  

2. The second diagram is another T-s diagram.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 'S (kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin)'.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'T (Kelvin)'.  
   - Points labeled '1', '2', '3', '4', and '5' are marked along the curves.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the process between states.  
   - Labels 'm dot K' and 'm dot M' are written near the arrows, indicating mass flow rates.
