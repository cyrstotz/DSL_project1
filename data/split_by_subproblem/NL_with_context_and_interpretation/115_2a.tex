The equation is written as:  
(f_6 minus f_4) divided by (f_4 minus f_2) equals x.  

Below this, there is a note mentioning "Thermodynamic mean temperature."

The page contains two diagrams labeled with temperature (T) and entropy (s) axes.  

1. The first diagram at the top shows a qualitative T-s diagram with a curved line representing a thermodynamic process. The curve includes labeled points:  
   - Point 1  
   - Point 2  
   - Point 3  

Arrows indicate transitions between these points, suggesting changes in temperature and entropy. The label "Kreisprozess" (cycle process) is written above the diagram.  

2. The second diagram at the bottom is another T-s diagram with a more detailed representation. It includes:  
   - A curved line starting at point 1 and moving through points 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
   - The label "Triple Temperatur als u" (possibly referring to triple temperature as a reference).  
   - The axes are labeled:  
     - Vertical axis: T [K]  
     - Horizontal axis: s [kJ/kgÂ·K]  

Arrows and transitions between points are drawn, indicating the thermodynamic steps in the process.

\[ w_6 = \sqrt{\frac{2 \dot{m}_K}{\dot{m}_M} \cdot \left[ \frac{w_5^2}{2} + \left( h_5 - h_6 \right) \right] } \]  

\[ h_6 = h_5 - \frac{w_6^2 - w_5^2}{2} \]  

\[ \Delta ex_{str} = \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} + \left[ c_p \cdot \left( T_6 - T_0 \right) - T_0 \cdot c_p \cdot \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) \right] \]  

\[ ex_{verl} = \dot{m}_K \cdot \left[ \frac{w_6^2}{2} + h_6 \right] - \dot{m}_M \cdot \left[ \frac{w_0^2}{2} + h_0 \right] = 0 \]  

Entropy balance equation for turbine:  
\[ \dot{S}_{erz} = \dot{m}_K \cdot \left( s_6 - s_5 \right) \]
