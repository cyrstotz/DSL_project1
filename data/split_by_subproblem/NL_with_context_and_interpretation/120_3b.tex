Since no additional force is applied, the process in the cylinder is isobaric, and the density of the water remains constant. Therefore, \( p_{Eis} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).  

In state 2, the ice-water mixture remains at equilibrium. The temperature \( T_{2w} = T_{2g} = 0^\circ \text{C} \), and the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium.  

Therefore:  
\( T_{2w} = T_{2g} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)
