A T-s diagram is drawn with the following features:  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
- Five states are marked on the diagram: 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.  
- State 1 is at the bottom left, connected to state 2 by a vertical line.  
- State 2 transitions to state 3 along a curved line.  
- State 3 transitions to state 5 along another curved line.  
- State 5 transitions to state 6 along a dashed vertical line.  
- Three isobars are drawn as curved lines, labeled \( T_0 \), \( T_B \), and \( T_5 \).
