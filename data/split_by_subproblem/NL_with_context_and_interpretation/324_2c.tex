Delta ex stream equals m dot times [h zero minus h six minus T zero times (s zero minus s six) plus delta k e].  

Delta ex stream equals:  
h zero minus h six equals c p times (T zero minus T six) equals minus eighty-five point three six kilojoules per kilogram.  

s zero minus s six equals c p times ln (T zero divided by T six) minus R times ln (p zero divided by p six) equals minus zero point three minus two hundred eighty-six point five three times ln (p zero divided by p six).  

R equals R divided by M equals eight point three one four divided by twenty-eight point nine seven equals two hundred eighty-six point nine nine.  

Delta k e equals (two hundred squared minus four hundred eighty-one point six squared) divided by two.  

Delta ex stream equals m dot times [minus eighty-five point three six minus two hundred forty-three point two five minus (minus zero point three) minus delta k e].
