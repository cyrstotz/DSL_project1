The equation for the mass-specific increase in flow exergy is written as:  
Exergy flow rate equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between the specific enthalpy at exit and inlet minus the product of the ambient temperature and the difference between the specific entropy at exit and inlet.  
This is expressed as:  
Exergy flow rate equals mass flow rate multiplied by (specific enthalpy at exit minus specific enthalpy at inlet minus ambient temperature multiplied by (specific entropy at exit minus specific entropy at inlet)).
