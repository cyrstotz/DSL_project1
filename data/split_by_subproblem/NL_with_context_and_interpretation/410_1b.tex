T KF equals integral from S e to S a of T dS divided by S a minus S e.  

Ideal liquid state:  
S a minus S e equals integral from T KF in to T KF out of c p liquid of T divided by T dT.  

P KF out equals P KF in, which implies isobaric plus adiabatic equals reversible plus isentropic.  

T KF equals T KF at inlet plus T KF at outlet divided by 2.  
T KF equals 293.15 Kelvin.
