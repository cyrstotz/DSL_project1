A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and isentropic curves.  
- The vertical axis is labeled as T (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as S (entropy).  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the diagram.  
- Isobaric and isentropic processes are indicated with arrows and curves.  
- Pressure values are noted:  
  - p2 = 0.5 bar  
  - p = 0.151 bar  

An equation is written:  
Tc = T5 multiplied by (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k).  

Substitution:  
Tc = 431.3 multiplied by (0.151 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4).  

Result:  
Tc = 328.67 K
