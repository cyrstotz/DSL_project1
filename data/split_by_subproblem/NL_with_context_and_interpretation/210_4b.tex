Mass flow rate of R134a:  
\( \dot{m}_{R134a} \)  

A diagram is drawn showing an isentropic process with arrows indicating flow through a component labeled '8 bar' and '28 W'.  

Equations and notes:  
- \( s_2 = s_3 \)  
- \( s_2 = s_g(T_2) \)  

First law of thermodynamics (steady-state flow process):  
\( 0 = \dot{m} [h_2 - h_3] + \sum \dot{Q} - \dot{W}_k \)  
Adiabatic process: \( \sum \dot{Q} = 0 \)  

Mass flow rate equation:  
\( \dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{h_2 - h_3} \)  

Saturation temperature:  
\( T_{sat} = 31.33^\circ C \, @ \, 8 \, \text{bar} \)
