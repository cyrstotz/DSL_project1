The diagram is a T-s (temperature-entropy) graph labeled with the following details:  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'S (kJ/kgÂ·K)' and the y-axis is labeled as 'T (K)'.  
- Points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are marked on the graph.  
- The process between points 5 and 6 is labeled as 'adiabatic reversible'.  
- The process between points 3 and S is labeled as 'isentrop'.  
- The process between points 0 and 1 is labeled as 'isentrop'.  
- The process between points 1 and 2 is labeled as 'isobar'.  
- The process between points 2 and 3 is labeled as 'isobar'.  
- The process between points S and 6 is labeled as 'isentrop'.  
- The pressure at point 5 is noted as 'p = 0.5 bar'.  
- The pressure at point 0 is noted as 'p0 = 0.191 bar'.  
- The mantle flow is labeled as 'mM'.  
- The core flow is labeled as 'mK'.
