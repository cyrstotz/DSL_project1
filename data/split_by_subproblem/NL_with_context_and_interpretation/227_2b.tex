The process from point 5 to point 6 is described as "adiabatic and reversible" and "isentropic."  

A table is drawn with columns labeled "P" (pressure), "T" (temperature), and "W" (velocity):  
- Row 0: P = 0.191, T = 243.15, W = 200.  
- Row 5: P = 0.5, T = 431.9, W = 220.  
- Row 6: P = 0.191.  

An equation is partially written:  
Î·_v,s < 1.
