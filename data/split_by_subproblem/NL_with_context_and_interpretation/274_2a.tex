T-S diagram with isobaric units:  
A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kg]' and the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The diagram shows five states connected by lines:  
- 1 to 2: adiabatic reversible high-pressure compressor  
- 2 to 3: isobaric heat addition  
- 3 to 4: adiabatic irreversible turbine  
- 4 to 5: isobaric mixing chamber  
- 5 to 6: reversible adiabatic nozzle
