PV equals mRT.  
R equals 854 Joules per mole Kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole equals 16628 Joules per kilogram Kelvin.  
A equals pi times (D divided by 2) squared equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.  

Pressure calculation:  
Druck EW1:  
P_Eis equals m_Eis divided by A times g divided by P_0 equals 1.43716.580 bar equals 1.44 bar.  

Druck Gas:  
[m_g divided by A] plus P_Eis equals P_g equals P_Eis plus m_g times g divided by A equals 1.44 bar minus P_g1.  

Mass calculation:  
PV equals mRT.  
m equals PV divided by RT equals P_g1 times V_g1 divided by R times T_g1 equals 3.517 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms equals m_g.
