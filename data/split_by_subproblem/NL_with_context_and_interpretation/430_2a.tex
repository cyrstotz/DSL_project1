A graph is drawn with axes labeled as T (temperature) and S (entropy). The graph shows several processes labeled as follows:  
- Point 0: Starting point.  
- Point 1: A curve labeled "isentrop".  
- Point 2: A curve labeled "isentrop".  
- Point 3: A curve labeled "isobar".  
- Point 4: A curve labeled "isobar".  
- Point 5: A curve labeled "isentrop".  
- Point 6: A curve labeled "isentrop".
