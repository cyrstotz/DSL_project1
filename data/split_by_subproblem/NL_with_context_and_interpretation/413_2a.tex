A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points and processes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K).  
- The y-axis is labeled as temperature (T) in Kelvin (K).  
- The diagram shows a curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Processes are marked as "irreversible" (between points 1 and 2), "reversible" (between points 3 and 4), and "isobaric" (between points 4 and 5).  
- The pressure conditions are indicated: \( p_4 = p_5 \), \( p_0 = p_6 \).  
- The fluid is labeled as "ideal fluid."
