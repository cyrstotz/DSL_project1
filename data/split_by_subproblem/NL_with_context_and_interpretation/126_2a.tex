A diagram is drawn showing a T-s (temperature-entropy) graph. The graph includes labeled points and lines:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 connected to point 2 by a vertical line.  
- Point 2 connected to point 3 by a horizontal line labeled \( p_{2,3} \).  
- Point 3 connected to point 4 by a slanted line.  
- Point 4 connected to point 5 by a horizontal line labeled \( p_5 \).  
- Point 5 connected to point 6 by a slanted line.  
- Point 6 connected back to point 0.  
The graph includes isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_5 \), and \( p_{2,3} \), and arrows indicating the direction of the process.
