The equation begins with the derivative of exergy over time:  
d by dt of exergy equals the sum of exergy streams in minus the sum of exergy streams out minus the sum of velocity squared divided by two times the ambient pressure divided by density minus exergy loss.  

Zero equals the change in exergy streams in minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals the change in exergy streams in minus exergy streams out.  

Exergy loss equals the change in exergy streams in minus exergy streams out divided by mass flow rate.  

Exergy loss equals 16.254 kilojoules.  

This result is underlined.
