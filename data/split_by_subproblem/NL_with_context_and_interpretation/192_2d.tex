A diagram labeled "Sys. Grenze" (system boundary) is drawn, showing a flow entering (\( \dot{m}_i \)) and exiting (\( \dot{m}_o \)) through a series of components.  

\( \dot{Q} = 0 \), \( \dot{W} = 0 \)  
(Note: "Work goes into compression" is written in parentheses.)  

The equation for exergy balance is provided:  
\( \frac{dE_{ex}}{dt} = \sum \dot{E}_{ex,in} - E_{ex,verl} \)  
\( = \dot{e}_{x,0} - \dot{e}_{x,6} - e_{x,verl} \)  

A note is added: "Seems wrong \( \dot{Q} \neq 0 \)."

O equals exergy zero minus exergy six plus  

Entropy: O equals mass flow rate times (entropy exit minus entropy inlet) plus heat flow divided by temperature plus entropy production rate  

O equals entropy exit minus entropy inlet plus heat flow divided by temperature plus entropy production rate  

Entropy production rate equals exergy loss divided by temperature zero  

O equals entropy zero minus entropy six plus heat flow divided by temperature plus exergy loss divided by temperature zero  

Natural logarithm of (temperature zero divided by temperature six) plus heat flow divided by temperature plus exergy loss divided by temperature zero equals zero  

Heat flow equals 1195 kilojoules per kilogram  

Temperature equals 1289 kelvin  

Exergy loss equals negative natural logarithm of (temperature zero divided by temperature six) times heat flow divided by temperature multiplied by temperature zero  

Exergy loss equals negative 152.1 kilojoules per kilogram  

(Underlined) exergy loss equals negative 152.1 kilojoules per kilogram
