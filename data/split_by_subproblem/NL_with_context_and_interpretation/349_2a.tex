Two diagrams are drawn:

1. **Top Diagram**:  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 's [kg·K]'.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
   - Several curved lines intersect across the graph.  
   - A process path is marked with numbered points: 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the process path between the points.  

2. **Bottom Diagram**:  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 's [kg·K]'.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
   - A closed polygonal shape represents a thermodynamic cycle.  
   - The cycle is labeled with points: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  
   - Two segments are labeled as 'isobar'.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the process path between the points.

\( E_{x, verl} \) equals \( \dot{m} \) times \([h_e - h_a - T_0 (s_e - s_a) + \delta h_e] + \sum_i \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_i}\right) \dot{Q}_j = e_{x, verl} \cdot \dot{m} \).  

0 equals \( \dot{m} \) times \([h_e - h_a + \delta h_e] + \sum_j \dot{Q}_j \).  

Therefore:  

\( E_{x, verl} \) equals \( \dot{m} \) times \([-T_0 (s_e - s_a)] + \sum_i \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_i}\right) \dot{Q}_j - \sum_j \dot{Q}_j \).  

This simplifies to:  

\( e_{x, verl} \) equals \(-T_0 (s_e - s_a) + \frac{\sum_i \left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_i}\right) \dot{Q}_j}{\dot{m}} - \frac{\sum_j \dot{Q}_j}{\dot{m}} \).
