A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis labeled in bar and temperature (T) on the x-axis labeled in Kelvin. The graph shows three distinct regions:  
- A line labeled "Fl√ºssig" (liquid) curves upward.  
- A vertical dashed line labeled "Ti const" separates the liquid region from the "Fest" (solid) region.  
- A diagonal line labeled "gas" extends upward from the dashed line.  

Additional notes are written below the graph:  
- Ti = solid plus 10 Kelvin.  
- x = 0 liquid equals vapor.  
- x = 1 p equals solid?
