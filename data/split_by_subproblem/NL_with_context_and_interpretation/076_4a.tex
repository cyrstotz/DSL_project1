A graph is drawn with axes labeled \( p \) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \( T \) (temperature) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes three regions labeled "Gasf√∂rmig" (gaseous), "Fest" (solid), and "Triplepunkt" (triple point). The triple point is marked where the solid and gaseous regions meet.
