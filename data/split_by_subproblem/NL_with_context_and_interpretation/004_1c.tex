A diagram is drawn showing heat transfer through a wall labeled "Wand." The heat flow \( \dot{Q} \) is 65 kW, with temperatures \( T_{KF} = 373.15 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_R = 373.15 \, \text{K} \).  

An entropy balance around the wall is written:  
\( 0 + \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{373.15 \, \text{K}} - \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{293 \, \text{K}} + \dot{S}_{erz} = 0 \).  

The entropy production is calculated:  
\( \dot{S}_{erz} = 0.04675 \, \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}} = 46.15 \, \frac{\text{W}}{\text{K}} \).
