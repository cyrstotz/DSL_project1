A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled curves and points:  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's' (entropy), and the y-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
- The diagram includes two isobars and two isentropes.  
- Points are labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The isobar curves connect points 1 to 2 and 3 to 4.  
- The isentropic curves connect points 0 to 1 and 5 to 6.  

Below the diagram, the following text is written:  
\( p_0 = 0.191 \), \( T_0 = -30^\circ \), \( s_0 = \)  
\( s_0 \rightarrow s_0 \), \( s_1 \rightarrow s_0 \)
