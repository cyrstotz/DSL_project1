Second law of thermodynamics:  
S erz equals m dot times (s a minus s e) minus Q out divided by T reactor minus Q out divided by T KF at the wall.  

S erz equals 1 kilogram per second times 65 kilowatts divided by 293.12 Kelvin plus 65 kilowatts divided by 293.12 Kelvin equals 0.0476 kilowatts per Kelvin equals 99.56 watts per Kelvin.
