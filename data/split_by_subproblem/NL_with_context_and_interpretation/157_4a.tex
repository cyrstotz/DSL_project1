Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a phase diagram with pressure (P) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis. It shows three regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). Three points are marked:  
   - Point 1 is in the "Fest" region.  
   - Point 2 is on the boundary between "Fest" and "Flüssig".  
   - Point 3 is in the "Gas" region.  
   The boundaries between the phases are curved lines.  

2. The second diagram is a simplified phase diagram with the same axes (P and T). It also shows the three regions: "Fest", "Flüssig", and "Gas". Points 1, 2, and 3 are similarly marked.
