A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The diagram includes isobars and an isentropic process. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- Horizontal axis: "S [kJ/kg·K]"  
- Vertical axis: "T [K]"  

The process transitions are marked:  
- From 0 to 2: upward curve.  
- From 2 to 3: steep upward curve labeled "booster".  
- From 3 to 4: horizontal line labeled "isobar".  
- From 4 to 5: downward curve labeled "isentrop sentrop?".  
- From 5 to 6: downward curve labeled "isentrop".  

An inequality is written:  
"η_V,s = (T_2s - T_0) / (T_2 - T_0) < 1."  
It is followed by:  
"⇒ T_2s > T_2."
