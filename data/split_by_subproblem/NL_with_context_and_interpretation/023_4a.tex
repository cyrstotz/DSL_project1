Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with a curve showing phase transitions. It includes labeled regions for solid, liquid, and gas phases.  
2. The second diagram is another p-T graph with a line labeled "Gas, Fest, Fl√ºssig" (Gas, Solid, Liquid). A point is marked as "Ti," and a line indicates the transition between phases.  

Below the diagrams:  
- \( T_i \) and \( p_i \) are given as:  
  \( p_i = 1 \, \text{mbar} \)  
  \( T_i = -10^\circ \text{C} \)  

Temperature of the freeze dryer is noted as \( -16^\circ \text{C} \).
