A graph is drawn with pressure (p) in bar on the vertical axis and temperature (T) in Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The graph includes a blue curve representing the phase boundary. Four labeled points (1, 2, 3, 4) are connected in a cycle, forming a rectangular path. The pressure values are marked as follows: point 1 and point 4 are at approximately 1 bar, while point 2 and point 3 are at 8 bar.
