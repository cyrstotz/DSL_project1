A diagram is drawn with the temperature (T) on the vertical axis and entropy (s) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled points and processes:  
- Point 1: "reversible"  
- Point 2: "irreversible"  
- Point 3: "isobar"  
- Point 4: "reversible"  
- Point 5: "k"  
Arrows indicate transitions between these points.
