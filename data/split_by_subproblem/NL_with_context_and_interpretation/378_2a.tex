A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as 'T [K]' (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgK]' (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  

The diagram includes several curves and points:  
- Points labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves.  
- Isobars are drawn and labeled as \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_3 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_5 \).  
- Arrows indicate the direction of processes between the points.  
- A dashed line connects points 5 and 6, with additional annotations near point 6.
