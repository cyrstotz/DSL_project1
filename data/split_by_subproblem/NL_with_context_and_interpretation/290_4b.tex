Mass flow rate calculation for R134a:  
Stationary process:  
dE/dt = mR [h2 - h3] - Wk  

T_i = 10K under sublimation point at triple point.  
T_i = -10°C → T_s = -16°C  

h2 (x = 1, T2 = -16°C) = 237.74 kJ/kg (from Table A-10).  
h3 (x = 0, p3 = 8 bar) = h (sat. liquid, p = 8 bar) = 266.497 kJ/kg (from Table A-10).  

s2 = s3 = 0.92987 kJ/kg·K (from Table A-10).  

mR = (237.74 - 266.497) = -28.757 kJ/kg.  
mR = 0.974 kg/s = 3.5 kg/h.
