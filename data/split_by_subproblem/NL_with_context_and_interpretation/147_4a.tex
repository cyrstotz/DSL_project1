A graph is drawn with pressure (p) labeled on the vertical axis in units of bar and specific volume (v) labeled on the horizontal axis in units of cubic meters per kilogram.  

The graph depicts a refrigeration cycle with four distinct states labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- State 1 is at the bottom left of the graph.  
- State 2 is higher up and slightly to the right of state 1.  
- State 3 is at the top right of the graph, with a curved line connecting states 2 and 3.  
- State 4 is at the bottom right, connected to state 3 by a downward sloping line.  

Arrows indicate the direction of the cycle:  
- From state 1 to state 2, the arrow moves upward.  
- From state 2 to state 3, the arrow follows the curve.  
- From state 3 to state 4, the arrow moves downward.  
- From state 4 to state 1, the arrow moves horizontally to the left.  

The graph represents the refrigeration process described in the task.
