R equals R divided by H equals 8314 divided by 50 equals 166.28 joules per kilogram Kelvin.  

p_g equals p_amb plus p_EV plus p_memb.  

p_g equals m_g times g divided by A plus m_EV times g divided by A plus p_amb.  

Filter: A equals 0.008 square meters.  

p_g equals 140094 pascal. p_g equals 1.4 bar.  

m_g equals p_g times V_g divided by R times T_g equals approximately 0.0034 kilograms equals 34 grams.
