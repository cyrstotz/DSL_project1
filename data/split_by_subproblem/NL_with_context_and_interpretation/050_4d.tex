The coefficient of performance (COP) of the cooling cycle is expressed as:  
epsilon subscript K equals absolute value of Q subscript 2 divided by (absolute value of Q subscript 2 minus absolute value of Q subscript 1), which equals absolute value of m dot times h subscript 2 minus h subscript 1 divided by W subscript K.
