Freeze drying process diagram:  
The first diagram shows a p-v (pressure vs. specific volume) graph with labeled points and processes. The processes include isobaric and isentropic steps. Key points are marked as T_i, T_s, and T_4. The diagram is annotated with arrows indicating the flow of the process.  

The second diagram shows a p-T (pressure vs. temperature) graph with labeled points and processes. Points are marked as 1, 2, 3, and 4, with annotations for vapor quality (x = 0 and x = 1). The processes include isobaric and isentropic steps.  

Additional note: "Sorry, falsch gelesen" (Sorry, misread) with a sad face drawn next to it.
