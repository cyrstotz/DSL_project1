A diagram is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin" and the y-axis labeled as "T in Kelvin."  
Three isobars are shown:  
- \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) (lowest curve)  
- \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) (middle curve)  
- An unlabeled isobar (highest curve).  

Points 2, 3, and 5 are marked on the diagram, with arrows indicating transitions between these points. The transitions are labeled as follows:  
- From 2 to 3: a vertical line upward.  
- From 3 to 5: a curved line downward.
