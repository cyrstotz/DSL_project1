Adiabatic process: Q_dot equals 0.  
Entropy balance:  
Q_dot divided by T_0 equals S_dot_erzeug plus m_dot multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0).  

0 equals Q_dot divided by T_0 plus m_dot multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0).  

S_dot_erzeug divided by m_dot equals c_p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0).  

S_dot_erzeug divided by m_dot equals 8.15 kilojoules per second.
