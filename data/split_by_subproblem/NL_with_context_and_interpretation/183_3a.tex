The general gas equation:  
p times V equals m times R times T  

The pressure is determined using the equilibrium:  
p_g,1 equals (m_EW times g divided by A) plus (m_K times g divided by A) plus p_amb  

with A equals pi times (D divided by 2) squared  

p_g,1 equals 1.6 bar  

m_g,1 equals R times T_g,1 divided by V_g,1 times p_g,1  

with R equals R divided by M_g equals 166.28 joules per kilogram times kelvin  

m_g,1 equals p_g,1 times V_g,1 divided by R times T_g,1  

equals 3.92 grams
