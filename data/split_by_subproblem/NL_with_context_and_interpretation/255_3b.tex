m1 equals m2.  
p1 equals p2 because the same "weight" is exerted by the piston.  
Isothermal polytropic change:  
T2 equals T1 multiplied by (V1 divided by V2) to the power of n minus 1.  
p2 multiplied by v2 equals R multiplied by T2.  
v2 equals R multiplied by T2 divided by p2.  
T2 equals T1 multiplied by (V1 divided by R multiplied by T2 divided by p2) to the power of n minus 1 equals T1 multiplied by R multiplied by T2 divided by V1 multiplied by p2.
