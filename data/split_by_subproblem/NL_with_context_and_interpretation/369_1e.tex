Delta S one two equals S two minus S one.  

Delta S one two equals S two minus S one times m two.  

S two times m two equals S two times five thousand seven hundred fifty-five kilograms plus three hundred kilograms.  

S one times m one equals S one times five thousand seven hundred fifty-five kilograms.  

S one at twenty degrees Celsius equals zero point four six four kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

S two at one hundred degrees Celsius and steam quality zero point zero zero five equals two point three zero six kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin plus zero point zero zero five times seven point three five four kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus seven point three zero six kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin equals two point three three four kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Delta S one two equals seven thousand two hundred twenty-seven point nine four kilojoules.
