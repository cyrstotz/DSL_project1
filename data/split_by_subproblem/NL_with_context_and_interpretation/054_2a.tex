A diagram is drawn showing a T-s (temperature-entropy) graph with labeled isobars \( P_0 \), \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_5 \). The states \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \) are marked along the graph. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (entropy). The temperatures \( T_0 = 253.15 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K} \) are noted.
