The vapor quality (\( x_1 \)) after the throttle:  
\( x_1 = \frac{\phi' - \phi_f}{\phi_g - \phi_f} \), where \( \phi \) represents properties such as specific volume (v), internal energy (u), enthalpy (h), and entropy (s).  
Result: \( h = 243.78 \), as the throttle is isenthalpic by definition.

E_k = (absolute value of Q̇_k) divided by (absolute value of Ẇ_el) = 6 divided by 28 = 0.214
