A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled 'T [K]' for temperature.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled 'S [kJ/kgK]' for entropy.  

The diagram includes the following labeled points and processes:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 connected to Point 2 via an isobaric line labeled 'p_0 = 0.191 bar'.  
- Point 2 connected to Point 3 via an adiabatic line.  
- Point 3 connected to Point 5 via an isobaric line labeled 'p_2'.  
- Point 5 connected to Point 6 via an adiabatic line.  
- Point 6 connected back to Point 0 via an isobaric line labeled 'p = 0.5 bar'.
