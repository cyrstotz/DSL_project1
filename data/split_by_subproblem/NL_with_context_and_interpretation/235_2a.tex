A T-s diagram is drawn with the temperature (T) on the vertical axis labeled in Kelvin (K) and entropy (s) on the horizontal axis labeled in kilojoules per Kelvin (kJ/K). The diagram includes the following labeled points and processes:  
- Point 1 to Point 2: Isentropic process.  
- Point 2 to Point 3: Isobaric process (p2 to p3).  
- Point 3 to Point 4: Isobaric process (p3 = p4).  
- Point 4 to Point 5: Isobaric process (p5).  
- Point 5 to Point 6: Isentropic process.  
- Point 6 to Point 1: Isobaric process (p0, labeled as "isobare").
