A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states.  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s" (entropy).  
- The diagram shows six states connected by curves and lines:  
  - State 0 is at the bottom left.  
  - State 2 is higher up, with \( p_2 = 13 \, \text{bar} \).  
  - State 3 is further up, connected by an isobar labeled "isobare".  
  - State 5 is at \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), connected by another isobar labeled "isobare mE".  
  - State 6 is at \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), connected by an isobar labeled "isobare".
