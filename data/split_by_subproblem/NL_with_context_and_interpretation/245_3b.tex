\( p_{g,2} = 140,059 \, \text{Pa} \)  

The pressure from outside that the gas must exert is still constant, so the gas pressure remains equal.  

\( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  

Since there is still ice present, the temperature of the ice-water mixture does not change until all the ice has melted. And because the gas is in equilibrium, it also assumes \( 0^\circ \text{C} \).
