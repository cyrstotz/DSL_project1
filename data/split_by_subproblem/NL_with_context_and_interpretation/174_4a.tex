A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled phase regions. The diagram includes the following:  
- A curve labeled "Triple" indicating the triple point.  
- An isobaric line labeled "p inside."  
- Four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- The process transitions are marked as "adiabat" and "isobar."  
The x-axis is labeled as "T [Â°C]" and the y-axis as "p [bar]."

The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) equals four kilograms per hour.
