\( \dot{Q}_{aus} = ? \)  
\( \dot{m}_{in} = \dot{m}_{aus} \Rightarrow \dot{m} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \)  

From the steady-state flow process:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} (\Delta h + \Delta e^u + \Delta p^u) + \Sigma \dot{Q} - \Sigma \dot{W} \)  

\( \dot{m} \Delta h + \Sigma \dot{Q} = 0 \)  

\( h_a = h_f + x_D (h_g - h_f) = 304.6491 \, \text{kJ/kg} \, (\text{Table A-2}) \)  
(at \( 70^\circ \text{C} \))  

\( h_e = h_f + x_D (h_g - h_f) = 430.3253 \, \text{kJ/kg} \, (\text{Table A-2}) \)  
(at \( 100^\circ \text{C} \))  

\( \dot{m} \Delta h + 100 \, \text{kW} + \dot{Q}_{aus} = 0 \)  

\( \dot{Q}_R = > |\dot{Q}_{aus}| = 62.294 \, \text{kW} \)  

---

Delta U equals Q dot R equals C KF multiplied by (T KF out minus T KF in).  

Therefore, C KF equals 6.2294.  

Delta S equals the integral from T KF in to T KF out of (C KF divided by T) dT (ideal liquid).  

Therefore, Delta S equals C KF multiplied by (ln(T KF out) minus ln(T KF in)) equals C KF multiplied by 0.2104.  

KF is a closed system.  

Therefore, Delta S equals Q dot R divided by T KF plus S dot erz.  

Therefore, T KF equals Q dot R divided by Delta S equals 295.123 Kelvin.  

c) This is now stationary.  

Therefore, m dot multiplied by Delta S KF divided by w KF plus Q dot R divided by T plus S dot erz equals 0.  

Therefore, S dot erz equals m dot multiplied by Delta S plus Q dot R divided by T KF.
