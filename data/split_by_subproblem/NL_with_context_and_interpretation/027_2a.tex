Exergy in a Jet Engine:  

A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points corresponding to states in the jet engine process. The diagram includes:  
- Isentropic compression (state 0 to state 1).  
- Isobaric heat addition (state 2 to state 3).  
- Adiabatic irreversible turbine (state 3 to state 4).  
- Isobaric mixing chamber (state 4 to state 5).  
- Reversible and adiabatic nozzle (state 5 to state 6).  

The axes are labeled:  
- Horizontal axis: Entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K).  
- Vertical axis: Temperature (T) in Kelvin (K).  

Additional notes:  
- "Isobars are a little steep, they should probably be more like //."
