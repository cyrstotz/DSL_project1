A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "P [Pa]" and the x-axis labeled as "T [K]". The graph includes two intersecting lines:  
- A purple line sloping downward from left to right.  
- A blue curve resembling a dome shape, labeled "Nassdampfgebiet" (wet steam region).

The page contains two diagrams related to thermodynamics.  

**Diagram 1 (Top):**  
- The graph is labeled with "a)" at the top.  
- The y-axis is labeled as "P [Pa]" (Pressure in Pascals).  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T [K]" (Temperature in Kelvin).  
- The graph shows intersecting lines, one sloping downward and another sloping upward.  
- A curve labeled "Tripel" (Triple point) is marked near the intersection of the lines.  
- The curve extends from the bottom left and rises slightly before leveling off.  

**Diagram 2 (Bottom):**  
- The y-axis is labeled as "P [Pa]" (Pressure in Pascals).  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T [K]" (Temperature in Kelvin).  
- The graph shows a triangular cycle with points labeled "2," "3," and "4."  
- Arrows indicate the direction of the cycle.  
- The process between points "4" and "2" is labeled "isobar" (constant pressure).  
- The process between points "2" and "3" is labeled "isochor" (constant volume).  
- The process between points "3" and "4" is labeled "isobar" (constant pressure).
