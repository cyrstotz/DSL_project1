Delta E equals the sum of Q twelve minus the sum of W v twelve.  

W equals the integral from one to two of p dV, which equals p gas times (U two minus U one).  

U two equals mRT two divided by p, which equals (3.42 times 10 to the power of minus three) times R times 273.153 divided by 1.4 times 10 to the power of five.  
This equals 0.01110 cubic meters, approximately 1.11 liters.  

Therefore, W equals 1.11 times 10 to the power of five times (1.11 times 10 to the power of minus three plus 3.11 times 10 to the power of minus three), which equals 594.943.  

Delta E equals c V times (T two minus T one), which equals 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (273.153 minus 773.15).  
This equals minus 3.96 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta E times m equals...  

Therefore, Q twelve equals Delta E plus W.
