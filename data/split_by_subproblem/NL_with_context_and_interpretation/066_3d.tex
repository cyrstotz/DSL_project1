Energy balance: \( \Delta E_{\text{tot}} = \Sigma Q - \Sigma W \)  
\( \Delta u = Q_{12} - W_{\text{ext}} \) with \( W_{\text{ext}} = p_{\text{ext}} (V_2 - V_1) \)  
\( Q_{12} = \Delta u + W_{\text{ext}} \)  
With \( V_2 = \frac{m \cdot R \cdot T_2}{p_2} = 1.14 \, \text{L} \)  
With \( p_g = p_1 = 4.99 \, \text{bar} \)

General approach:  
Energy balance only for the EW from state 1 to state 2.  
dE equals minus summation of C equals summation of Q, since kinetic and potential energies are negligible.  

mEW delta u equals Qzu with Qzu equals 204.01 kilojoules and xEW equals mIce divided by mEW.  

mEW delta u equals Qzu.  
mEW delta u equals Qzu.  

mIce2 divided by mEW equals mIce1 divided by mEW minus Qzu divided by mEW u.  

mIce2 divided by mEW equals Qzu plus mEW u divided by mEW u.  

xIce2 equals Qzu plus mEW u divided by mEW u.  

From the tables (TAB A1):  
u liquid at 0 degrees Celsius equals minus 0.045 kilojoules per kilogram.  
u fusion at 0 degrees Celsius equals minus 333.458 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Therefore, u liquid minus u fusion...
