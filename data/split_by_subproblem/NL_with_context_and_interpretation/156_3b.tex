\( x_{\text{Ice},2} > 0 \)  

Given \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \):  

\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \), as the water is incompressible and the ice melting leads to no volume change. The EW is therefore isochoric, and the equation (1) from part (a) is valid for part (b).  

\( T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{n-1} \)  

\( T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{n-1} \) (2)  

\( p_{g,2} V_{g,2} = m_g R T_{g,2} \)  

\( V_{g,2} = \frac{m_g R T_{g,2}}{p_{g,2}} \)
