Entropy production in the wall:  
Q-out divided by T-KF equals 293.12 Kelvin.  
Q-out divided by 100 degrees Celsius.  

Entropy balance for steady-state flow process:  
0 equals m-dot multiplied by (S-e minus S-a) plus Q-out divided by T-KF plus Q-out divided by T-Reactor plus S-dot-erz.  

S-dot-erz equals Q-out multiplied by (1 divided by T-KF minus 1 divided by T-Reactor).  

S-dot-erz equals 53.91 watts per Kelvin.
