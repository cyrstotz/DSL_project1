Delta ex equals ex6 minus ex0 equals exi minus O.  

Delta ex equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0) plus w6 squared divided by 2 minus (h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s0 minus s0) plus w0 squared divided by 2).  

h6 minus h0 equals cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0).  
h6 minus h0 equals 85.6429.  

s6 minus s0 equals ln(T6 divided by T0) minus R divided by cp multiplied by ln(p0 divided by p6).  
s6 minus s0 equals 0.2995.
