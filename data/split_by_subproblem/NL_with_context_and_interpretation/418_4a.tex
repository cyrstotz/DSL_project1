A graph is drawn with pressure (p) in bar on the vertical axis and temperature (T) in Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points and processes:  
- Point 1 is connected to Point 2 with the label "isobaric freezing" (isobares Einfrieren).  
- Point 2 is connected to Point 3 with the label "isothermal pressure reduction" (isothermes Drucksenken).
