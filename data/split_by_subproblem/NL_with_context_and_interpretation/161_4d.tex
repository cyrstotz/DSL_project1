The equation for the coefficient of performance (COP) is written as:  
EK = absolute value of QK divided by absolute value of WK.  

Additional equations and notes:  
- QK = m dot times (h3 minus h1).  
- h2 = hg (8 bar) = g2 (T2).  
- s2 = s3.  
- s2 = sg (T1 minus 6Â°C).  
- x3 = (s2 minus sf (8 bar)) divided by (sg (8 bar) minus sf (8 bar)).  
- h3 = hf (8 bar) plus x times (hg (8 bar) minus hf (8 bar)).  

References to Table A-11 are noted for values of sf and sg.
