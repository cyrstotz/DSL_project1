A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [K]) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows phase regions labeled as "solid," "gasf√∂rmig" (gaseous), and "ND" (likely referring to a phase boundary). The following processes are marked:  
- "ischor" (isochoric)  
- "isentrop" (isentropic)  
- "isotherm" (isothermal)  
The graph includes transitions between phases, with arrows indicating directions of processes.
