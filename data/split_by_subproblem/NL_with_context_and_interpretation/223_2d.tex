Exergy loss equals ambient temperature multiplied by entropy production.  

Entropy production equals mass flow rate multiplied by the reaction heat divided by temperature.  

Entropy production equals 0.3 kilograms per second multiplied by 100 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 245.15 Kelvin, which equals 30 kilojoules per second Kelvin.  

Exergy loss equals ambient temperature (245.15 Kelvin) multiplied by entropy production (30 kilojoules per second Kelvin), which equals 7294.5 kilojoules per second Kelvin.
