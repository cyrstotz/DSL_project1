The diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  

- The x-axis is labeled as 'T [K]' for temperature in Kelvin.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'p [bar]' for pressure in bar.  
- Three phase regions are marked:  
  - 'Fest' (solid phase) on the left.  
  - 'Flüssig' (liquid phase) in the middle.  
  - 'Gasförmig' (gaseous phase) on the right.  

- The triple point is labeled at the intersection of the three phase boundaries.  
- Two steps are indicated with arrows:  
  - Step 'i' moves vertically downward from the liquid phase to the solid phase.  
  - Step 'ii' moves horizontally to the right from the solid phase to the gaseous phase.
