Delta exergy flow equals exergy flow at state 6 minus exergy flow at state 0.  

Delta exergy flow equals h minus h_0 minus T_0 multiplied by (s minus s_0) plus kinetic energy plus potential energy.  

Exergy flow equals delta h minus T_0 multiplied by delta s plus kinetic energy.  

Delta h equals c_p (specific heat at constant pressure) multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0).  
c_p equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
Delta h equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by (340 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin).  
Delta h equals 36.91 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta s equals c_p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p_6 divided by p_0).  
Delta s equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by the natural logarithm of (340 Kelvin divided by 243 Kelvin) minus 0.287 multiplied by the natural logarithm of (1).  
Delta s equals 0.335.  

Kinetic energy equals one-half multiplied by (v_6 squared minus v_0 squared).  
Kinetic energy equals one-half multiplied by (510 meters per second squared minus 200 meters per second squared).  
Kinetic energy equals 48,050 joules per kilogram, which equals 48.05 kilojoules per kilogram.
