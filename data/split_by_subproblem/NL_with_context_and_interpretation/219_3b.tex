\( T_{\text{EW},2} = T_s2 = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  

This applies because thermodynamic equilibrium is established.  

Volume calculation:  
\( V_{s2} = \frac{V_{s1}}{M_g} = 1.2362 \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg} \)  

Pressure result:  
\( p_{s2} = p_{s1} = 1.0401 \, \text{bar} \)  

This applies because the gravitational force and external pressure do not change.
