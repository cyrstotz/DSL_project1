A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis.  
- The graph includes two labeled processes:  
  - "process von i)" (process from step i) is shown as a horizontal line at constant pressure.  
  - "process von ii)" (process from step ii) is shown as a vertical line at constant temperature.  
- The horizontal line is labeled "isobar."  
- The vertical line is labeled "isotherm."
