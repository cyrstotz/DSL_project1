Exergy loss equals delta exergy of flow plus exergy of heat minus exergy of work.  

Exergy loss equals delta exergy of flow plus (1 minus temperature at state 0 divided by temperature at state B) multiplied by heat added in the combustion chamber.  

Exergy loss equals delta exergy of flow plus (1 minus temperature at state 0 divided by temperature at state B) multiplied by heat added in the combustion chamber, resulting in exergy loss equals 1070.508 kilojoules per kilogram.
