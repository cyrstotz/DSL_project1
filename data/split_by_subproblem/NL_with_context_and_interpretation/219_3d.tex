First law of thermodynamics for the ice-water mixture (EW):  
m sub EW times (u two minus u one) equals Q one-two.  

u one equals u sub f plus x one times (u sub s minus u sub f).  
u one equals negative 200.03 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table 1).  

u two equals Q one-two divided by m sub EW plus u one.  
u two equals u sub f plus x two times (u sub s minus u sub f).  
u two equals negative 183.94 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Therefore, x two equals (u two minus u sub f) divided by (u sub s minus u sub f).  
x two equals 0.5638 (from Table 2).
