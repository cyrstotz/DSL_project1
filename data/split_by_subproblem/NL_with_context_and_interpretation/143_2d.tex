No work is supplied, only the streams and heat flow are considered.  

Exergy balance for the entire system (stationary):  
0 equals mass flow rate of gas multiplied by negative delta exergy of the stream plus exergy flow of heat minus exergy loss.  

Exergy flow of heat equals (1 minus T0 divided by T) multiplied by heat flow rate, which equals mass flow rate multiplied by (1 minus T0 divided by T) multiplied by qB.  

Total mass flow rate equals mass flow rate of the mantle plus mass flow rate of the core, which equals 5.293 multiplied by mass flow rate of the core, which equals 6.293 multiplied by mass flow rate of the core.  

Mass flow rate of the core equals total mass flow rate divided by 6.293.  

0 equals negative delta exergy of the stream plus 1 divided by 6.293 multiplied by (1 minus T0 divided by T) multiplied by qB minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals 1 divided by 6.293 multiplied by (1 minus T0 divided by T) multiplied by qB minus delta exergy of the stream, which equals 137.89 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals 19.78 kilojoules per kilogram.
