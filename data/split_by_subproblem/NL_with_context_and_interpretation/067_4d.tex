e k equals Q two divided by W k equals one hundred forty-six point forty-two watts divided by twenty-eight watts equals five point twenty-three.  

Energy balance (flow process):  
Q equals m dot times [h two minus h one] plus Q u.  
Arrow pointing to Q u equals m dot times [h two minus h one] equals one hundred forty-six point forty-two watts.
