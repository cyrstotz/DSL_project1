T_EW equals 0 degrees Celsius.  
The EW is in state 2 and remains at 0 degrees Celsius since it is still in a two-phase equilibrium state and is in thermodynamic equilibrium.  
p_g2 equals 1.4 bar because at 0 degrees Celsius, the EW also generates a pressure of 1.4 bar, and it must be in equilibrium.
