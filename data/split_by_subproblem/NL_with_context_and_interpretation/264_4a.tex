A pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram is drawn. The diagram includes the following annotations:  
- A curve labeled "mass dampf" (mass vapor).  
- State points labeled as "1", "2", "3", and "4".  
- Between states 1 and 2: "adiabatic and reversible (isentropic) compression".  
- Between states 2 and 3: "isobaric vollst√§ndige Verdampfung" (isobaric complete evaporation).  
- Between states 3 and 4: "isobaric condensation".  
- Between states 4 and 1: "adiabatic expansion".  
- The x-axis is labeled "T - 6K" (temperature minus 6 Kelvin).  
- The y-axis is labeled "p" (pressure).
