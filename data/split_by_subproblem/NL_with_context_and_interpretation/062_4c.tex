A schematic diagram is drawn representing a refrigeration cycle. It includes arrows indicating the flow of refrigerant labeled as "R134a." The diagram shows four components connected in sequence:  
1. An expansion valve (left side).  
2. A heat exchanger (middle).  
3. A compressor (right side).  
4. Another heat exchanger (returning to the expansion valve).  

The refrigerant flow is indicated with arrows, and the cycle is labeled as "R134a."
