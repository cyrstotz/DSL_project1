Diagram: A schematic representation of a cycle with points labeled 4 and other points connected by arrows.  

h1 = 92.42  
p1 = 6 bar  

Interpolation @ Table A-12:  
h = (phi(p1) - phi(p2)) / (p1 - p2) * (p - p2) + phi(p2)  
(This will also be used for P)  

P = (h - phi(p2)) / (phi(p1) - phi(p2)) * (p1 - p2) + p2
