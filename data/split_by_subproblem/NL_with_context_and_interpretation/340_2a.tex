A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and processes. The diagram includes the following:  
- A curve labeled "nozzle" connecting states 5 and 6.  
- A curve labeled "isentropic" connecting states 3 and 4.  
- A curve labeled "compressor" connecting states 2 and 3.  
- A curve labeled "mixing" connecting states 4 and 5.  
- Axes are labeled as "T" (temperature) on the vertical axis and "s" (entropy) on the horizontal axis.
