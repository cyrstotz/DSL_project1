The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) for the gas is calculated as isobaric:  
\( W_{12} = \int_1^2 p \, dv = R T_{12} \)  

\( Q_{12} = \Delta E = m (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{ab} = W_{12} + W_{i} \)  

\( Q_{ab} = m c_V (T_2 - T_1) = 0.00584 \, \text{J} = 5884 \, \text{mJ} \)  

\( Q_{ab} = 5884 \, \text{mJ} \)

Delta E equals m multiplied by (u2 minus u1) equals Qab minus W.  

Qab equals m multiplied by cv multiplied by (T1 minus T2) equals 1139.4 joules.
