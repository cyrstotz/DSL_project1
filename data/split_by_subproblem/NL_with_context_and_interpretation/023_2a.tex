Graphs:  
Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a T-s diagram (temperature versus entropy).  
   - The y-axis is labeled T (Kelvin).  
   - The x-axis is labeled s (kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin).  
   - Several isobars are drawn, labeled with pressure values.  
   - Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves, with arrows indicating transitions between states.  
   - The isobar for 0.191 bar is highlighted.  

2. The second diagram is another T-s diagram.  
   - The y-axis is labeled T (Kelvin).  
   - The x-axis is labeled s (kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin).  
   - Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves.  
   - Arrows indicate transitions between states, and the isobaric process is emphasized.
