b)  

T bar equals integral from s_e to s_a of T ds divided by (s_a minus s_e).  

q divided by T equals s, therefore T equals q divided by s.  

T bar equals Q dot_out times natural logarithm of (s_a divided by s_e) divided by (s_a minus s_e).  

s_a minus s_e equals integral from T_1 to T_s of c_if divided by T dT, which equals c_if times natural logarithm of (T_2 divided by T_1).  

T bar equals Q dot_out divided by c_if times natural logarithm of (T_2 divided by T_1).
