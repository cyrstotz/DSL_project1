Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with a curved line labeled "Eis" (ice) and "Aggr." (aggregation). The axes are labeled with "p" for pressure and "T" for temperature.  
2. The second diagram is another p-T graph with a straight line and a marked region. The axes are labeled "p" for pressure and "T" for temperature. The temperature axis includes a point labeled "-20Â°C".
