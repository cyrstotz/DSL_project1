Energy balance: Closed system  
Change in energy equals Q twelve minus W reversible twelve.  

W reversible twelve equals the integral from V one to V two of p outside dV.  
p outside equals p gas one.  
V two equals (assuming T gas two equals zero degrees Celsius).  
pV equals mRT.  
V two equals m gas times R gas times T gas two divided by p gas one.  

Equals 1.111 liters equals 0.00111 cubic meters.  

Result:  
Equals negative 223.41 joules.  

2)  
Change in energy equals m times (u two minus u one) equals m times (cV times (T two minus T one)).  

Equals 0.00269 times (6.833 times (273.153 minus 773.15)).  

Equals negative 851.38 joules.  

Result:  
Q twelve equals negative 1074.79 joules.
