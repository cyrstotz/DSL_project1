Entropy balance for a steady flow process:  
Zero equals mass flow rate times entropy change plus heat flow divided by temperature plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals negative mass flow rate times entropy change minus heat flow divided by temperature.  

Ideal fluid:  
Entropy change equals specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of temperature two divided by temperature one.  

Energy balance in the ideal fluid:  
Zero equals mass flow rate times enthalpy change plus heat flow.  

Mass flow rate equals heat flow divided by enthalpy change.  

Mass flow rate equals heat flow divided by specific heat capacity times temperature two minus temperature one.  

Entropy production equals negative heat flow divided by specific heat capacity times temperature two minus temperature one times specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of temperature two divided by temperature one minus heat flow divided by temperature.  

Entropy production equals negative six hundred twenty-three point two kilojoules per kelvin.
