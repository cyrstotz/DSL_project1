A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) (in mbar) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) (in Â°C) on the x-axis.  
- The curve starts at the bottom left and rises upward, labeled as the "Triple point."  
- Point 2 is labeled at the top of the curve, with an arrow pointing to the right labeled "isobar single phase."  
- Point 3 is labeled below the triple point, with a horizontal arrow pointing left labeled "isotherm."
