Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream six minus exergy stream zero.  
Delta ex equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy six minus enthalpy zero minus temperature zero multiplied by (entropy six minus entropy zero) plus kinetic energy).  
Specific enthalpy six minus enthalpy zero equals specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature six minus temperature zero) equals 1.006 multiplied by (84.925 minus 85.435).  
Entropy six minus entropy zero equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature six divided by temperature zero) minus gas constant divided by the polytropic exponent multiplied by the natural logarithm of (pressure six divided by pressure zero) equals 0.301.  

85.435 minus 243.75 multiplied by 0.301 plus (velocity six squared minus velocity zero squared divided by two) equals delta exergy stream.  

Velocity six equals 310 meters per second.  
Velocity zero equals 200 meters per second.  

Delta exergy stream equals 42.887 plus 110.062 kilojoules per kilogram.
