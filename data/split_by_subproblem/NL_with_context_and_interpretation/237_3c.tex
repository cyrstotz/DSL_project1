The entropy change \( \Delta S_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\( \Delta S_{12} = \frac{Q_{12}}{T_{g}} \)  

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is determined as:  
\( Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_{2g} - T_{1g}) \)  
\( = 110.95 \, \text{J} \)  

Given values:  
\( T_{2g} = 0.003 \, ^\circ \text{C} = 273.153 \, \text{K} \)  
\( T_{1g} = 773.15 \, \text{K} \)
