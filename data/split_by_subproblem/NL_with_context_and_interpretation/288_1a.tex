Q equals m dot times (h in minus h out) plus Q dot R minus V dot squared divided by two plus Q dot out.  

h at 70 degrees Celsius equals h in equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram (Table A-2).  
h at 100 degrees Celsius equals h out equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram (Table A-2).  

Q dot out equals m dot times (h out minus h in) minus Q dot R equals 0.3 times (419.04 minus 292.98) minus 100 equals negative 62.18 kilowatts.
