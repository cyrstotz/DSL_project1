Energy balance for the compressor:  
0 = mass flow rate of refrigerant times (h2 minus h3) plus heat flow rate minus work rate.  

Work rate divided by (h2 minus h3) equals the mass flow rate of refrigerant.  

h2 equals h2 saturated liquid at temperature T2.  

T2 equals Ti minus 6 Kelvin.  

With conditions from ii), Ti can be determined using the p-T diagram:  
Ti equals 10 degrees Celsius equals 283.15 Kelvin.
