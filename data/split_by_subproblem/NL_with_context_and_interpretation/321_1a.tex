Energy balance:  
Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy in and enthalpy out, plus reaction heat flow minus heat flow out.  

Heat flow out equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy in and enthalpy out, plus reaction heat flow.  

Enthalpy in equals enthalpy of saturated liquid at 70 degrees Celsius, which is 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram (Table A-2).  
Enthalpy out equals enthalpy of saturated liquid at 100 degrees Celsius, which is 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram (Table A-2).  

Heat flow out equals 0.3 kilograms per second multiplied by the difference between 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram and 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram, plus 100 kilowatts.  

Equals 62.182 kilowatts.

A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The curve starts at the bottom left and rises smoothly to the top right. The curve is labeled with "solid" at the lower part, "liquid" in the middle, and "gas" at the upper part. The triple point is marked on the curve where the three phases meet.
