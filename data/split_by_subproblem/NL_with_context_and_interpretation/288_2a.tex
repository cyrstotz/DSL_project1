A T-s diagram is drawn with temperature (T) on the vertical axis and entropy (S) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled isobars:  
- \( P_2 = P_3 \)  
- \( P_1 = P_5 = P_4 \)  
- \( P_0 \)  

The process is illustrated with arrows connecting states:  
- State 0 to State 1  
- State 1 to State 2  
- State 2 to State 3  
- State 4.5 to State 5  
- State 5 to State 6
