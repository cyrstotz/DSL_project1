O equals integral from s2 to s1 plus Q divided by T plus S irreversibility.  
S irreversibility equals integral from s1 to s2 minus integral from s2 to s1.  
Equals 0.7056 minus Q divided by T.  
Equals 0.7056 plus 61.182 divided by 275.  
Equals 0.3764163 kilojoules per kelvin.  
Equals 376.39 joules per kelvin.

Thermodynamic mean temperature formula:  
T bar equals integral of T dS divided by integral of dS equals integral of T dS divided by S2 minus S1 equals integral from Te to Ta of c divided by T dT divided by c times ln(Ta divided by Te).  

Simplified:  
T bar equals Q divided by c times ln(Ta divided by Te) equals epsilon times (Ta minus Te) divided by c times ln(Ta divided by Te) equals Ta minus Te divided by ln(Ta divided by Te).
