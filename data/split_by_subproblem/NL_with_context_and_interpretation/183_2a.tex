A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the y-axis and entropy (S) on the x-axis. The graph shows a qualitative T-S diagram with labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the origin.  
- Point 1 slightly above and to the right of point 0.  
- Point 2 higher and further to the right.  
- Point 3 significantly higher and further to the right.  
- Point 4 slightly below point 3 but still to the right of point 2.
