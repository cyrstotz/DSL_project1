Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a T-s diagram (temperature versus entropy). It includes labeled points and curves:  
   - Points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 5.  
   - Isobars labeled as P1, P3, and P5.  
   - Curves connecting the points, representing processes in the jet engine.  

2. The second diagram is another T-s diagram with labeled points and curves:  
   - Points labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
   - Isobars labeled as P1 = P3 and P0 = P6.  
   - Curves connecting the points, representing processes in the jet engine.

O equals ex_str plus the summation of ex_R minus summation of (w_p multiplied by delta t divided by delta t) minus ex_verl.  

R divided by T equals ex_u equals (1 minus T_0 divided by T) multiplied by Q minus [summation of w_in minus p_0 multiplied by v_2 minus v_1].
