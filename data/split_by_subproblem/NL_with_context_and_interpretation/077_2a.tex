A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars, isotherms, and isentropic processes. The diagram includes points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 connected by lines representing different thermodynamic processes.  

- The isobars are labeled as \( p_7 \, \text{po} \), \( p_5 \, \text{po} \), and \( p_0 \).  
- The isotherm is labeled at \( -30^\circ \text{C} \).  
- The isentropic processes are marked with arrows indicating constant entropy.  

Below the diagram, the processes between the points are described:  
- (1 → 2): Isentropic, \( s \)-constant, \( p \) decreases.  
- (2 → 3): Isobaric, \( p \)-constant, \( T \) increases.  
- (3 → 4): Not isentropic.  
- (4 → 5): Isobaric, \( p \)-constant.  
- (5 → 6): Isentropic, \( s \)-constant.  

A smaller schematic diagram is drawn on the right side, showing a simplified representation of the thermodynamic cycle with numbered points.
