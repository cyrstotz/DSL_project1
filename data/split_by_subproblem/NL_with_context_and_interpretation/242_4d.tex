E_k equals Q_zu divided by W_k.  
Q_zu equals Q_u.  

=> 0 equals m_dot multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1) plus Q_k.  

Diagram: A schematic of a system with two states labeled 1 and 2, showing heat flow Q_k entering the system.  

Q_k equals m_dot multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1).  

h_2 equals h_1 plus 35.66% multiplied by (h_fg minus h_f) equals 93.42 kJ/kg.  
h_1 equals 23.162 kJ/kg equals 0.084 multiplied by 45 divided by 5 equals 88.91 W.  

=> E_k equals Q_zu divided by W_k equals 91 W divided by 28 W equals 3.25.
