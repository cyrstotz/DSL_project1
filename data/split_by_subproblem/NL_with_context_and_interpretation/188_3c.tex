Temperature of equilibrium equals 0.003 degrees Celsius.  

Mass times specific internal energy at state 2 minus mass times specific internal energy at state 1 equals heat transfer minus work.  
Mass times (specific internal energy at state 2 minus specific internal energy at state 1) equals heat transfer.  
Mass times specific heat capacity times (temperature at state 2 minus temperature at state 1) equals heat transfer.  

(3.42 grams times 0.963 joules per gram per kelvin) times (273.153 kelvin minus 773.15 kelvin) equals heat transfer.  
Heat transfer equals negative 1.082 kilojoules.

z divided by v equals.  

Two times (plus) u divided by z equals x times w equals 0.45 times x.  

b divided by r equals 85.598.  

b divided by r equals 85.598 times (z divided by r minus v) equals.  

qb times (b divided by r minus v) equals 9.45 times x equals.  

Entropy change.
