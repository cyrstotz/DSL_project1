From state 2 to state 3, the process is isentropic.  
s2 equals s3.  

A table is drawn with the following columns:  
- Zustand (state)  
- p (bar)  
- T  
- x  
- s  
- h  

The rows are filled as follows:  
1 | - | - | - | - | h1  
2 | - | - | 1 | s2 equals s3 | -  
3 | 8 | - | - | - | h3  
4 | 8 | - | 0 | - | h4  

=> x3 =  

h1 equals hf (86 kJ/kg) equals 93.42 kJ/kg equals h1.
