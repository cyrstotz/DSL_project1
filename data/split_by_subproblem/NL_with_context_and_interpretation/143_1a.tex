Energy balance of the reactor: (stationary) (boiling water)  

0 equals mass flow rate in times enthalpy in plus reaction heat flow plus mass flow rate out times enthalpy out.  

Mass flow rate in equals mass flow rate out.  

From Table A-2:  
Enthalpy in equals enthalpy of saturated liquid at 70 degrees Celsius equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.  
Enthalpy out equals enthalpy of saturated liquid at 100 degrees Celsius equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Heat flow out equals mass flow rate in times (enthalpy out minus enthalpy in) plus reaction heat flow.  
Heat flow out equals 137.818 kilowatts.
