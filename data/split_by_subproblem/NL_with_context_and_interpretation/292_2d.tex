Exergy loss equals T subscript 0 multiplied by entropy production, which equals exergy loss in.  

Entropy production equals:  
Delta entropy minus Q divided by T.  

This equals:  
100 kilojoules per kilogram minus (1195 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 1289 Kelvin), which equals 99.07.  

Final result:  
Exergy loss equals 240.85 megajoules.
