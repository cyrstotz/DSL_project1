A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states.  
- The diagram includes states 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The isobars are labeled as \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) and \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The temperature at state 0 is labeled as \( T_0 = -30^\circ \text{C} \).  
- The axes are labeled as \( T \, [K] \) for temperature and \( s \, [\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}] \) for entropy.
