E_k equals the absolute value of Q_k divided by the absolute value of W_in, which equals the absolute value of Q_k divided by the absolute value of W_in.  

W_k equals 28 watts.  

Q_k:  
The rate of change of entropy with respect to time equals m_dot multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1) plus Q_k minus m_dot multiplied by u_0.  

Q_k equals m_dot multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1).
