Thermodynamic equilibrium in state 2:  

\( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} \)  

Since the temperature in the solid-liquid region remains constant:  
\( T_{\text{EW},2} = T_{\text{EW},1} \)  
Thus, \( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},1} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  

\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 0.4 \, \text{bar} \)  

Because no mass is lost and the area remains constant, the same mass continues to exert pressure on the same surface.
