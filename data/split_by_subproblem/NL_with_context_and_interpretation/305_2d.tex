Exergy loss specific equals Delta exergy specific plus (T zero divided by T B) multiplied by q B.  
Entropy production specific equals (s zero minus s six) plus q B divided by T B.  
This equals c p multiplied by ln(T zero divided by T six) minus R multiplied by ln(p zero divided by p six) plus q B divided by T B.  
This equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by ln(243.15 Kelvin divided by 328.07 Kelvin) plus 1.195 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 1289 Kelvin.  
This equals 0.6257 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
Exergy loss specific equals entropy production specific multiplied by T zero.  
Exergy loss specific equals 0.6257 multiplied by 243.15 Kelvin.  
This equals 152.14 kilojoules per kilogram.
