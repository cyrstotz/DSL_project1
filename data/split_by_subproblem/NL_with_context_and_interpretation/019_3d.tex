The equation for heat transfer is:  
Q_12 = m multiplied by (U_2 minus U_1)  

To calculate U_2:  
U_2 = Q_12 divided by m plus U_1  
= 1500 joules divided by 0.1 kilograms plus (-133.1262 kilojoules per kilogram)  
= -118.1262 kilojoules per kilogram  

For U_1:  
U_1 = -333.458 plus 0.6 multiplied by (-0.0015 minus (-333.458)) (from Table 1)  
= -133.1262 kilojoules per kilogram  

Interpolation with EW Table 1 at T = 0.003 degrees Celsius:  
x = (U_2 minus U_test) divided by (U_fluessig minus U_test)  
= 0.645
