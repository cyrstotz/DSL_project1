A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis. The graph shows the freeze-drying process with labeled regions:  
- "Komprimiert" (compressed) near point 3.  
- "Isobare Verdampfung" (isobaric evaporation) near point 4.  
The graph includes points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, connected by curves representing the process steps.
