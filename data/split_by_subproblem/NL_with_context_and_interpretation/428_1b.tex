The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant stream is calculated as the ideal mean temperature with constant \( c_p(T) = c_p \).  

\( s(T_2) - s(T_1) = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} c_p(T) \, \text{d}T \)  
\( \implies \bar{T} = \frac{\int_{T_1}^{T_2} c_p(T) \, \text{d}T}{s(T_2) - s(T_1)} \)  

\( s(T_{mean}) = s(T_{KF,in}) - s(T_{KF,out}) \)  

\( c_p(T) \) is linear.  

\( \bar{T} = \frac{T_{KF,in} + T_{KF,out}}{2} \)  
\( \implies \bar{T} = 295.15 \, \text{K} \).
