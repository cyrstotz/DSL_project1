A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S (kJ/kgÂ·K)". The graph shows several curves representing isobars labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_2/p_3 \), and \( p_5 \). Six states are marked on the graph: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The transitions between these states are indicated with arrows, showing the process flow.
