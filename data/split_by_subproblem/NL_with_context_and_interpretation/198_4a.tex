A diagram is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows a cycle with four labeled points:  
- Point 1: "geregelte vollstst√§ndig isobaresiert" (regulated fully isobaric).  
- Point 2: "mehr Dampf gegeben" (more vapor added).  
- Point 3: "iso bar" (isobaric).  
- Point 4: "isentrop" (isentropic).  

The cycle transitions between isobaric and isentropic processes.
