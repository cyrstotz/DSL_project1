S2 equals S3.  

The equation is written as:  
0 equals m dot R134a multiplied by (h2 minus h3) plus Q dot 23 minus L dot 23.  

L dot 23 equals L dot K equals negative 28 kW.  

m dot R134a equals 4 multiplied by (kJ divided by A) equals 7.111 multiplied by 10 to the power of negative 3.  

The equation is rewritten as:  
0 equals m dot R134a multiplied by (h2 minus h1).  

T2 equals negative 22 degrees Celsius equals 251.15 K.  

S3 equals S2 equals S(T equals negative 22 degrees Celsius) equals 0.9089 minus 0.9102 divided by (24 minus 20) multiplied by (24 minus 22) plus 0.9089 equals 0.90955 kJ divided by kgÂ·K.
