Exergy loss equals zero.  
Zero equals negative Delta exergy flow plus exergy flow due to heat transfer minus exergy flow due to work minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals negative Delta exergy flow plus (1 minus T_0 divided by T_B) multiplied by q_B.  
Exergy loss equals 869.58 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Calculation:  
Exergy loss equals negative 260.99 kilojoules per kilogram plus (1 minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by 1289 Kelvin) multiplied by 1195 kilojoules per kilogram.
