Exergy balance:  
Delta exergy equals exergy in minus exergy out.  

Exergy balance equation:  
Exergy equals mass flow rate times (h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0) plus (w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2)).  

Calculation:  
Exergy equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0) plus (w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2).  

Substituting values:  
Exergy equals 0.362 minus 291.9 minus 243.15 times (s6 minus s0) plus (200 squared minus 5.462 squared divided by 2).  

Entropy calculation:  
s6 minus s0 equals s(T6) minus s(T0) minus T0 times (s(T0) minus ln(p6 divided by p0)).  

Substituting:  
s6 minus s0 equals cp times ln(T6 divided by T0) minus ln(p6 divided by p0).  

cp divided by cv equals n.  
cp equals n times cv equals 1.4 times 0.006 equals 1.4084.  

Final entropy calculation:  
s6 minus s0 equals 1.4084 times ln(314.45 divided by 243.15) equals 0.362 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
