Exergy loss equals T0 times entropy production.  

Entropy production equation:  
Entropy production equals entropy in minus entropy out plus entropy from turbine.  

Entropy production calculation:  
Entropy production equals mass flow rate in times (s2 minus s0) plus mass flow rate out times (s4 minus s3) plus q divided by T_B.  

Mass flow rate calculation:  
Mass flow rate equals mass flow rate core plus mass flow rate mantle.  
Mass flow rate mantle divided by mass flow rate core equals 5.293.  
Mass flow rate core equals mass flow rate divided by 6.293.  

Entropy difference:  
s4 minus s3 equals cp times ln(T4 divided by T3) minus ln(p4 divided by p3).  
s3 minus s2 equals cp times ln(T3 divided by T2) minus ln(p3 divided by p2).
