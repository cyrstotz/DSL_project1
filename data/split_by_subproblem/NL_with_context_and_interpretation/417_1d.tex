Mass of water added multiplied by the specific heat capacity of water multiplied by the temperature difference equals the mass of the reactor multiplied by the specific heat capacity of the reactor multiplied by the temperature difference plus the mass of water added multiplied by the specific heat capacity of water multiplied by the temperature difference.  
Mass of water added multiplied by the temperature difference equals the mass of the reactor multiplied by the temperature difference minus the mass of water added multiplied by the temperature difference.  
Mass of water added equals 5755 kilograms multiplied by the temperature difference of 100 degrees Celsius minus 70 degrees Celsius divided by 80 degrees Celsius minus 20 degrees Celsius.  
Mass of water added equals 3453 kilograms.
