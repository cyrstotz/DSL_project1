Thermodynamic mean temperature \( T_{KF} \):  
T KF equals integral of q over ds divided by (s2 minus s1).  

For constant pressure and ideal liquid:  
T KF equals (h1 minus h2) divided by (s1 minus s2).  
Equals q divided by (ln of T1 minus T2) divided by (ln of T1 divided by T2).  
Equals negative 10 Kelvin divided by ln of (288.15 Kelvin divided by 298.15 Kelvin).  
Equals 293.15 Kelvin.
