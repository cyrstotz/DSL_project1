A graph is drawn with pressure (p [mbar]) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [°C]) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes the following features:  
- A curve labeled "Sublimationspunkt" (sublimation point) separating the regions of "flüssig" (liquid) and "flüssig-gasförmig" (liquid-gaseous).  
- Two steps labeled "i)" and "ii)" are marked on the graph.  
- The horizontal axis ranges from -70°C to 20°C, with arrows pointing at specific points.
