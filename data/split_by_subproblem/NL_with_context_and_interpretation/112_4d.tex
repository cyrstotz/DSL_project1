The coefficient of performance (COP) is equal to the heat removed divided by the work input, which is expressed as:  
COP equals Q subscript K divided by (i subscript a subscript o subscript l minus K subscript u subscript l), which is equal to (i subscript a subscript o subscript l divided by i subscript a subscript o subscript l minus K subscript u subscript l).
