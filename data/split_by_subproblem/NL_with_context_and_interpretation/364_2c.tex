The page contains three diagrams labeled with temperature (T) and entropy (S) axes, representing thermodynamic processes.  

1. **Diagram 1**:  
   - The process starts at point 0 with \( T_0 = -30^\circ \text{C} \), \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  
   - The transitions are described as follows:  
     - 0 to 1: \( p_0 \) to \( p_1 \).  
     - 1 to 2: Isentropic compression, \( p_1 \) to \( p_2 \).  
     - 2 to 3: Isobaric heat addition, \( p_2 \) to \( p_3 \).  
     - 3 to 4: Not isentropic, \( p_4 \), \( T \).  
     - 4 to 5: Isobaric, \( p_4 \) to \( p_5 \).  
     - 5 to 6: Isentropic expansion, \( p_5 \) to \( p_6 \).  

2. **Diagram 2**:  
   - The process is shown with labeled points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
   - The transitions are visually represented with curved and straight lines indicating isentropic and isobaric processes.  

3. **Diagram 3**:  
   - The process is labeled with detailed annotations:  
     - 0 to 1: Isobaric (\( p_0 \), \( p_6 \)).  
     - 1 to 2: Isentropic.  
     - 2 to 3: Isobaric (\( p_1 \), \( p_2 \)).  
     - 3 to 4: Isobaric (\( p_2 \), \( p_3 \)).  
     - 4 to 5: Not isentropic.  
     - 5 to 6: Isentropic.  

The diagrams visually depict the thermodynamic processes in a jet engine, with clear transitions between states and annotations for isentropic and isobaric phases.

\( \dot{w}_{\Delta ex, str} = \dot{m} \left[ h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} \right] \)  

\( \Delta ex_{str,6} = c_p (T_6 - T_0) - T_0 c_p \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) \)  

\( \Delta ex_{str,6} = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgK}} \cdot (328.075 \, \text{K} - 243.15 \, \text{K}) - 243.15 \, \text{K} \cdot 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgK}} \cdot \ln \left( \frac{328.075}{243.15} \right) \)
