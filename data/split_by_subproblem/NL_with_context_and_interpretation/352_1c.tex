The entropy production equation is:  
dS/dt equals the sum of m dot s plus the sum of Q dot divided by T plus S dot_erz.  

O equals m dot times (s_KF,out minus s_KF,in) plus Q dot_out divided by T_KF plus S dot_erz.  

S dot_erz equals m dot times (s_KF,out minus s_KF,in) minus Q dot_out divided by T_KF.  

For an ideal fluid:  
s_KF,out minus s_KF,in equals the integral of c divided by T from T_in to T_out.
