Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled "p(T)" and "p over T (cooling chamber)." It shows a curve with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is connected to point 2 with a vertical line labeled "sotrop." Point 4 is connected to point 1 with a horizontal line.  

2. The second diagram is labeled "p(Mass)" and "p over T." It shows a curve with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is connected to point 2 with a curved line, and point 3 is connected to point 4 with another curved line.  

Both diagrams have axes labeled "T [K]" for temperature.

A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the y-axis labeled as 'p [mbar]'. The graph shows a curve with four points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.  

- Point 1 connects to Point 2 with a line labeled 'isentrop'.  
- Point 2 connects to Point 3 with a line labeled 'isobar'.  
- Point 3 connects to Point 4 with another line labeled 'isobar'.  
- The curve peaks between Points 3 and 4 and then descends towards Point 1.  

The letters 'ND' are written near the x-axis.
