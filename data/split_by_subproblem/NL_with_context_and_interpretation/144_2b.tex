The heading reads "=> isentrope schubdüse" (isentropic nozzle).  

An equation is written:  
TG divided by TS equals (pG divided by pS) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.  

TG equals pS multiplied by TS multiplied by (pG divided by pS) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.  

Substituting values:  
TG equals 431.9 multiplied by (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of (0.4 divided by 1.4).  
TG equals 328.97 Kelvin.  

A first law of thermodynamics equation is written:  
dE divided by dt equals m multiplied by (hS plus wS squared divided by 2 minus hG minus wG squared divided by 2) plus ΣQ dot minus ΣW dot.  

Rearranged:  
wG equals (hS plus wS squared divided by 2 minus hG minus wG squared divided by 2) multiplied by 2.  

Substituting values:  
hS minus hG equals cp multiplied by (TS minus TG).  
wG equals the square root of 2 multiplied by cp multiplied by (TS minus TG) plus wS squared divided by 2.  

Final result:  
wG equals 257.3 meters per second.  
wG equals 487.3 meters per second (corrected value).
