Delta ex_str equals m_g multiplied by (h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0)) plus (w_6 squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2).  

This equals m_g multiplied by c_p^0 multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 multiplied by c_p^0 multiplied by (ln(T_6 divided by T_0)) plus (w_6 squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2).  

This equals m_g multiplied by (1006 joules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by (323.075 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin) minus 243.15 Kelvin multiplied by (1006 joules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by ln(323.075 Kelvin divided by 243.15 Kelvin)) plus (50.7 squared meters per second squared minus 200 squared meters per second squared divided by 2)).  

This equals m_g multiplied by 120.73 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Thus, Delta ex_str equals 120.73 kilojoules per kilogram.
