The equation for energy balance is written as:  

dE/dt = 0 = sum of (mass flow rate times enthalpy at inlet and outlet) + Q̇ - sum of work rates  

m times (u2 - u1) = Q̇  

The pressure of the ice-water mixture in state 2 is:  
p_EW,2 = p_0 + F/A + m_g  
= p_atm  
= 1.4 bar  

The mass balance equation is expressed as:  
m times (x_Eis,2 times u_ice,2 + (1 - x_Eis,2) times u_liquid,2) - (x_Eis,1 times u_ice,1 + (1 - x_Eis,1) times u_liquid,1) = Q_12
