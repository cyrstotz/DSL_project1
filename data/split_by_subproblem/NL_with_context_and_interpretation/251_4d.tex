First law of thermodynamics (1. HS) is applied:  
- 1. HS (2-3):  
  - 0 = m_dot_R134a (h_2 - h_3) - W_dot_c  
  - m_dot_R134a = W_dot_c / (h_2 - h_3)  
- h_2 = h_g (40Â°C) = 249.53 kJ/kg  
- h_3 = Not visible.

epsilon sub k equals Q dot sub 2u divided by W dot sub 1 equals Q dot sub 2u divided by Q dot sub ab minus Q dot sub 2u.
