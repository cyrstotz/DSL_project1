T KF bar equals average Q A to S divided by m dot W times (S A minus S E).  

Q A to S divided by m dot W times (S A minus S E).  

m dot equals Q dot divided by h equals delta Q divided by negative delta S equals T bar.  

T bar equals 376.1364 Kelvin minus 308 Kelvin equals f cp times (T2 minus T1) divided by cp ln (T2 divided by T1) equals negative 253.12 Kelvin.
