The membrane is heat-conducting, so the EW and the gas have the same temperature.  

The same applies to the pressure; the membrane is frictionless.  

p sub 2 equals F sub K divided by A equals 32 kilograms times 9.80665 meters per second squared divided by 0.05 squared equals 3955.9847 newtons per meter squared equals approximately 3956 newtons per meter squared.
