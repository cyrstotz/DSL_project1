A pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram is drawn. The y-axis is labeled as "p [bar]" and the x-axis as "T [K]". The diagram includes a curve with labeled points and transitions:  

1-2: T increases, p increases  
2-3: s2 equals s3, p increases  
3-4: Isobaric process, T increases, p equals constant  
4-1: Isenthalpic process, h4 equals h1, p decreases, T equals constant  

Below this, another p-T diagram is drawn with a rectangular cycle. The y-axis is labeled "p [bar]" and the x-axis "T [K]". The points are labeled:  

1 → 2: T increases, p increases  
2 → 3: p equals constant  
3 → 4: T decreases, p equals constant  
4 → 1: T equals constant
