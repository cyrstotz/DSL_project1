Delta S one two equals m two times s two minus m one times s one.  
Equals sixty-four thousand seven hundred fifty-five kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

m one equals five thousand seven hundred fifty-five kilograms.  
m two equals m one plus Delta m one two equals nine thousand three hundred fifty-five kilograms.  

s two at seventy degrees Celsius, x equals one equals seven point seven five five three kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

s one at one hundred degrees Celsius, x equals zero point zero zero five equals s f plus x times (s g minus s f).  
Equals one point three three plus fourteen kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
