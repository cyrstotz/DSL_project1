The heading reads "wc = 5 multiplied by 10 raised to the power of 3, TG = 340 Kelvin".  

An equation for flow exergy is written:  
Δexstr equals hG minus h0 minus TG multiplied by (sG minus s0) plus wG squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

Substituting values:  
hG minus h0 equals cp multiplied by (TG minus T0).  
sG minus s0 equals cp multiplied by ln(TG divided by T0).  

Rearranged:  
Δexstr equals cp multiplied by (TG minus T0) minus TG multiplied by cp multiplied by ln(TG divided by T0) plus wG squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

Final result:  
Δexstr equals 125.47 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Additional notes:  
A crossed-out term appears: "ln(p0 divided by pG)".
