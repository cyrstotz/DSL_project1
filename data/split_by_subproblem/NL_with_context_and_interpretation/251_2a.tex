A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T (K)" and the x-axis labeled as "s (kJ/kgÂ·K)". The graph shows several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked.  
- The curve connecting points 2 and 3 is labeled "P2 = P3".  
- The curve connecting points 1 and 5 is labeled "P1 = P5".  
- The curve connecting points 6 and 0 is labeled "P6 = P0".  
- Arrows indicate the direction of the process between the points.
