A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]' and the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with labeled points:  
- Point 0: 'isentrop'  
- Point 1: 'adiabat'  
- Point 2: 'isobar'  
- Point 3: 'adiabat'  
- Point 4: 'isobar'  
- Point 5: 'isentrop'  
- Point 6: 'adiabat'
