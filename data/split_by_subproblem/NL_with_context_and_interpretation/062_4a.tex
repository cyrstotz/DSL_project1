A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p" (pressure) and the x-axis labeled as "v" (specific volume in cubic meters per kilogram). The graph shows a curve resembling a phase diagram. The curve starts low, rises to a peak, and then descends. The peak represents the critical point. There are two distinct regions separated by the curve: one labeled "liquid" on the left and another labeled "gas" on the right.
