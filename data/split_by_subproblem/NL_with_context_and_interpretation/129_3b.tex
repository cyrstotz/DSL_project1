\( T_{g,2}, p_{g,2} \)  
=> \( p_2 = p_1 \) (since the force/pressure equilibrium always remains the same)  
\( p_{g,2} = 1.401 \, \text{bar} \)  

For \( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \), the temperature of the EW must always remain at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \).  
Since \( Q_{ab} = 0 \), \( T_{g,2} \) must also equal \( T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).
