A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kg·K]'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  

The diagram includes six states labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- State 1 to State 2 is marked as 'isentrop'.  
- State 2 to State 3 is marked as 'adiabat revers'.  
- State 3 to State 4 is marked as 'isobar'.  
- State 4 to State 5 is marked as 'isobar'.  
- State 5 to State 6 is marked as 'adiabat revers'.  

A note is written near the curve between State 1 and State 2: "wie es wirklich verläuft" (how it really behaves).
