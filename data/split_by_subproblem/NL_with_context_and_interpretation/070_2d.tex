Exergy loss equals T0 multiplied by entropy production.  

Steady-state flow process:  
0 equals m dot multiplied by (s0 minus s6) plus Q divided by Tg plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals s6 minus s0 minus q divided by Tg, which equals 0.927905 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 719.608 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 1289 Kelvin, which equals 0.505 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Exergy loss equals T0 multiplied by entropy production, which equals 243.15 multiplied by 0.505, resulting in 122.832 kilowatts per kilogram.
