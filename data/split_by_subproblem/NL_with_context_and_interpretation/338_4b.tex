A schematic diagram of a compressor is drawn. It shows the flow entering at state "2" and exiting at state "3". The work \( W_K \) is indicated as being applied to the system.  
The following equations are written:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K \)  
\( \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3} = \dot{m} \)  

Additional notes:  
- \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are labeled with "8 bar".  
- \( s_2 = s_B \)  
- \( s_3 \) is labeled as "superheated".  
- \( s_3 (8 bar) \) is referenced with "TAB 12".
