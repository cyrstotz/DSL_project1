The energy balance equation is written:  
dE/dt = Σṁ [hi + ke + pe] + ΣQj - ΣWn  

A note is added: "o, da adiabatisch eine Schaufelreihe verrichtet keine Arbeit" (o, since adiabatic, a blade row performs no work).  

The following derivation is shown:  
T6/T5 = (p6/p5)^(n-1/n) → T6 = (p6/p5)^(n-1/n)  
Ts = 0.7586 × 431.9K → Tg = 328.07K  

The equation for O is written:  
O = ṁgas [hs - hc + ws squared/2 - wc squared/2] - 0  

The enthalpy difference is calculated:  
hs - hc = cp (T5 - T6) = 1.006 kJ/kg·K × (431.9K - 328.07K) = 104.44825 kJ/kg  

The velocity difference is derived:  
wc squared/2 = hs - hc + ws squared/2  
wc squared = 2 [hs - hc + ws squared/2]  
wc = √[2 (hs - hc + ws squared/2)] = √[2 × (104.448 + 4.498)] = 220.497 m/s  

The final velocity is underlined: 220.497 m/s.
