Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is labeled with "p(h)" on the y-axis and "T(K)" on the x-axis. It shows a curve with regions labeled "solid," "mass-point," and "gas."  
2. The second diagram is labeled with "p(h)" on the y-axis and "T(K)" on the x-axis. It shows a curve labeled "sublimation point" and "Ti."
