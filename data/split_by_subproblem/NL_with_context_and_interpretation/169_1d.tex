dE/dt equals m dot multiplied by (h1 minus h2) plus Q dot minus W dot.  

Delta E equals Delta m12 multiplied by (h1 minus h2).  

Delta E equals Delta U, which equals U2 minus U1.  

Delta m12 equals u2 minus u1 divided by h1 minus h2, which equals C multiplied by (T2 minus T1) divided by C multiplied by (T1 minus T2), which equals infinity.
