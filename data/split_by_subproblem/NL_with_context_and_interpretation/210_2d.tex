Exergy loss equals Delta exergy stream plus exergy stream from heat divided by mass flow rate, which equals Delta exergy stream plus exergy stream from heat.  

Exergy stream from heat in the combustion chamber:  

Exergy stream from heat equals (1 minus 243.15 Kelvin divided by 1289 Kelvin) multiplied by 9B.  

Exergy stream from heat equals 969.58 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Exergy loss equals 100 kilojoules per kilogram plus 969.58 kilojoules per kilogram equals 1069.58 kilojoules per kilogram.
