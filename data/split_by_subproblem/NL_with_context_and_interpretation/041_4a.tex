Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram shows a pressure (p) versus temperature (T) graph with a curve that appears to represent phase transitions. The curve includes regions labeled with phase boundaries.  
2. The second diagram is a more detailed pressure-temperature graph. It includes labeled regions:  
   - "fest" (solid)  
   - "fl√ºssig" (liquid)  
   - "Gas" (gas)  
   - A point labeled "TP" (triple point)  
   - Another point labeled "Ti" (interior temperature).
