A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled phase regions: "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous). There are curves and transitions marked between the phases, including points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4". The transitions between phases are indicated with arrows, and the regions are separated by lines.
