A graph is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "p [P]" (pressure).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "T [Â°K]" (temperature).  

The graph shows a cycle with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- Between points 1 and 2, the process is labeled "isobar."  
- Between points 3 and 4, the process is labeled "isobar."  
- The cycle connects these points in a closed loop.  

A smaller, unlabeled diagram is drawn to the right of the main graph.
