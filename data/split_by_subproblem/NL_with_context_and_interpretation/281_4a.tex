Energy balance:  

m dot times (h three minus h two) plus W u equals zero  

m dot equals W u divided by (h two minus h three)  

u to one, s equals constant  

s four (x equals zero, saturated liquid) equals 0.2419  

s u equals s three equals s three saturated liquid plus alpha times (s three gas minus s three saturated liquid)  

x equals (s four minus s three saturated liquid) divided by (s three gas minus s three saturated liquid)  

h three equals h three saturated liquid plus x times (h three gas minus h three saturated liquid)  

equals h three saturated liquid plus ((s four minus s three saturated liquid) divided by (s three gas minus s three saturated liquid)) times (h three gas minus h three saturated liquid)

A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn with labeled points 1, 2, 3, and 4 forming a cycle. The vertical axis is labeled as 'p [bar]' and the horizontal axis as 'T [Â°C]'.
