p_EW equals m_K multiplied by g divided by A plus p_amb.  
p_EW equals 32 kilograms multiplied by 9.81 meters per second squared divided by (0.05 meters squared) plus 1 bar.  
This equals 39989.52 pascals plus 1 bar, which equals 1.399 bar (underlined).  

u equals u_F plus x multiplied by (u_Fest minus u_Flussig).  
Therefore, x equals (u minus u_Flussig) divided by (u_Fest minus u_Flussig).  

Interpolation:  
y equals (x minus x_1) divided by (x_2 minus x_1) multiplied by (y_2 minus y_1) plus y_1.  

x_1 equals tabulated value, 0.003.  
x_2 equals (not provided).
