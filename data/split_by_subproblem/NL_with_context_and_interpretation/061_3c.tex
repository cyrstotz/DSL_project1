The equation for energy balance is written as:  
dE divided by dt equals the summation of Q dot minus the summation of W dot.  

Delta E equals Q12 minus Wv.  

The work, W, is calculated as the integral from state 1 to state 2 of p dv, which simplifies to p multiplied by (V2 minus V1).  

V2 is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
V2 equals (m multiplied by R multiplied by T) divided by p.  
Substituting values:  
m equals 0.00342 kg, R equals 273.15, T equals 500 K, and p equals 0.4629 bar.  
After calculation, V2 equals 7.109 liters.  

Substituting into the work equation:  
W equals 1.907 multiplied by (3.744 minus 1.709 liters), resulting in 284.54 kJ.  

Delta E is calculated as:  
Delta E equals m multiplied by (Cv multiplied by (T2 minus T1)).  
Substituting values:  
m equals 342 g, Cv equals 0.633 kJ/kgÂ·K, T2 equals 500 K, and T1 equals 0 K.  
Delta E equals 7.08 kJ.  

The total heat transfer, Q, is calculated as:  
Q equals Delta E plus W.  
Substituting values:  
Q equals 7.08 plus 0.97, resulting in 2.055 kJ.
