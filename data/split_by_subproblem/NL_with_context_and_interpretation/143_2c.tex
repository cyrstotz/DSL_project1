Delta exergy of the stream equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0) plus p0 multiplied by (V6 minus V0).  

h6 minus h0 equals cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0), which equals 57.05 kilojoules per kilogram.  
s6 minus s0 equals cp multiplied by ln(T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by ln(p6 divided by p0), which equals 0.191 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

R equals cp minus cp divided by kappa, which equals 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Using the ideal gas law:  
p6 multiplied by V6 equals RT6 divided by p6, which equals 4.416 cubic meters per kilogram.  
V0 equals RT0 divided by p0, which equals 3.653 cubic meters per kilogram.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals 19.78 kilojoules per kilogram.
