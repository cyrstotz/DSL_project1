A graph is drawn with labeled axes.  
- The y-axis is labeled "Pressure" with markings for "Atmosphere" and "0.005 mbar."  
- The x-axis is labeled "Temperature" with markings at -50°C, -40°C, -30°C, -20°C, -10°C, and 0°C.  
- A curve is drawn, representing the phase regions.  
- Two points are marked:  
  - "1" at 5 mbar below the triple point.  
  - "2" at 10K above the sublimation point.
