Negative delta exergy stream equals h zero minus h six minus T zero multiplied by (s zero minus s six minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of p zero divided by p six) plus w zero squared divided by two minus w six squared divided by two.  

h six at 340 Kelvin equals 340.42.  
s six at 340 Kelvin equals 1.8279.  

h zero at 243 Kelvin equals 250.05 minus 240.02 divided by 250 minus 240 multiplied by (243 minus 240) plus 240.02, which equals 243.03 kilojoules per kilogram.  

s zero at 243 Kelvin equals 1.51917 minus 1.47824 divided by 250 minus 240 multiplied by (243 minus 240) plus 1.47824, which equals 1.480513 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Negative delta exergy stream equals h zero minus h six minus T zero multiplied by (s zero minus s six minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of p zero divided by p six) plus w zero squared divided by two minus w six squared divided by two.  

Equals 243.03 minus 340.42 minus 243 multiplied by (1.480513 minus 1.8279 minus 287 multiplied by the natural logarithm of (0.191 divided by 0.5)) plus (200 squared divided by two minus 510 squared divided by two).  

Equals negative 95 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy stream equals 95 kilojoules per kilogram.
