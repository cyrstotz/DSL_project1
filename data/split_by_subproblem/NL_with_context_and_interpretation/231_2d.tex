Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals ambient temperature multiplied by entropy production.  

Entropy production equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between entropy at state 2 and entropy at state 1.  

Entropy production equals mass flow rate multiplied by the natural logarithm of temperature at state 2 divided by temperature at state 1 multiplied by specific heat capacity.  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals ambient temperature multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of temperature at state 2 divided by ambient temperature.  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals two hundred ninety-three point one five Kelvin multiplied by one point zero zero six kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by the natural logarithm of three hundred forty Kelvin divided by two hundred ninety-three point one five Kelvin.  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals eighty-two point zero one kilojoules per kilogram.
