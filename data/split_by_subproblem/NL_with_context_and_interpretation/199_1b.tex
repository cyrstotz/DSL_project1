The equation for T bar is written as:  
T bar equals the integral from s_1 to s_2 of T ds divided by s_2 minus s_1.  

ds equals dQ divided by T.  

T bar equals delta Q divided by delta T multiplied by the natural logarithm of T_2 divided by T_1.  

T bar equals T_2 minus T_1 divided by the natural logarithm of T_2 divided by T_1.  

T bar equals 298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of 298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin.  

T bar equals 283.12 Kelvin.
