Zero equals mass flow rate times enthalpy plus heat flow minus work.  
Zero equals mass flow rate times enthalpy plus heat flow minus work.  
Work equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 3).  
Mass flow rate equals work divided by (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 3).  
Enthalpy at state 2 equals enthalpy of gas at temperature minus a value.  
Isentropic process: entropy at state 3 equals entropy at state 2.  
Pressure ratio raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n) equals temperature ratio.  
Temperature at state 2 equals temperature at state 3 times (pressure at state 2 divided by pressure at state 3) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).
