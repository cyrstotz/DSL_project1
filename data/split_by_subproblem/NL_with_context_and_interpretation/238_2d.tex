\( \Delta ex_{str} = 100 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

From the summary, we know that for stationary flow processes, the following applies:  

\( O = -\Delta ex_{str} + \dot{ex}_Q - \dot{N}_{in} - ex_{verl} \)  

\( ex_{verl} = -\Delta ex_{str} = -100 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

\( ex_{verl} = -100 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)
