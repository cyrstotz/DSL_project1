A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and processes:  
- 0 to 1: Isentropic, T1  
- 1 to 2: mk, Isentropic, T1  
- 2 to 3: mk, Isobaric, T1  
- 3 to 4: mk, Irreversible turbine  
- 4 to 5: mk + mm, Isobaric  
- 5 to 6: Isentropic  

Additional notes:  
- T0 greater than T1  
- S0 less than S1  
- "Sorry, German salad in my head â€” I mean isentropic."
