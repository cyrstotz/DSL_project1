Delta exergy of the stream equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and state 0 minus the product of ambient temperature and the difference in entropy at state 6 and state 0, plus the difference in kinetic energy between states 6 and 0.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals mass flow rate multiplied by the enthalpy difference (h6 minus h0) minus ambient temperature multiplied by the entropy difference (s6 minus s0), plus the difference in kinetic energy (w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2).  

h6 minus h0 equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the temperature difference (T6 minus T0), which equals 97.45 kilojoules per kilogram.  

s6 minus s0 equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of the temperature ratio (T6 divided by T0), which equals 0.3373 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals 97.45 kilojoules per kilogram minus ambient temperature (245.15 Kelvin) multiplied by 0.3373 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, plus the difference in kinetic energy (510 squared minus 200 squared divided by 2).  

Delta exergy of the stream equals 110.065 kilojoules per kilogram.
