\( T_{g,2} / p_{g,2} \)  
(It stabilizes, meaning \( x_2 < x_1 \) before.)  
The temperature of the gas will decrease due to heat transfer \( Q_{12} \).  
Pressure remains \( p_1 \), as external conditions do not change.  
Temperature will reach approximately \( 0^\circ \text{C} \), as the water has a latent heat capacity.  
Since the ice at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) first undergoes a phase transition, energy is consumed!  
From solid to liquid, the air absorbs energy and changes without affecting the temperature.  
\( T_{g} \to 0^\circ \)  
\( p_{g,2} = p_1 \)
