A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph includes several curves and lines:  
- A parabolic curve representing an isobar.  
- A straight line labeled "isotherm".  
- Another curve labeled "adiabat".  
- The diagram is marked with points labeled "1", "2", and "5".

A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S". The graph shows several curves and lines:  
- Three isobaric lines are drawn, labeled as "isobar".  
- A process path is marked with points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4".  
- The path includes segments labeled "adiabatic", "reversible", and "isobar".  
- The process transitions between these points, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  

Below the graph, text explains:  
- "0 vergleichen sind adiabatisch reversibel."  
- "Wenn nicht reversibel, ist es nicht adiabatisch oder Verdichtung."  
- A formula is written:  
  \[ S = \left[ \frac{h}{T} \right] \]
