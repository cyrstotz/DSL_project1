A T-s diagram is drawn with temperature (T in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and entropy (S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows the jet engine process with labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the origin.  
- Point 1s and Point 1 connected by an isentropic line.  
- Point 2 connected to Point 3 by an isobaric line.  
- Point 3 connected to Point 4 by another isobaric line.  
- Point 4 connected to Point 5 by an isentropic line.  
- Point 5 connected to Point 6 by another isentropic line.  
The pressures \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_0 = p_6 \) are indicated.  
The diagram includes annotations in red: "isobar" and "isentrop."  
A note is written: "adiabatic-reversible = isentrop."

h_6: Interpolation from Table A22 (with T_6).  

325 K → 325.31  
326.075 K → 326.341  

h_6 = 325.31 + (320.241 - 325.31) / (330 - 325) × (326.075 - 325)  
= 328.40354 kJ/kg  

w_6 = √(2 × (h_6 - h_5) + w_5 squared) = 219.52 m/s
