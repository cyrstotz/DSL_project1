A graph is drawn with pressure (p in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points and lines:  
- Point 1 labeled as "isobar".  
- Point 2 labeled as "isobar".  
- A curve labeled "Triple".  
- Point 5 is marked near the curve.  
- Lines connecting the points are drawn, indicating transitions between states.
