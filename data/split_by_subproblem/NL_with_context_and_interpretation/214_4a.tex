A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). Two processes are marked:  
- Process "i" is labeled as "isobar" and shows a vertical line from state 1 to state 2.  
- Process "ii" is labeled as "isotherm" and shows a horizontal line from state 3 to state 2.
