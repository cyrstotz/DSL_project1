q subscript k equals Q dot subscript k divided by W dot subscript t equals Q dot subscript k divided by W dot subscript t equals Q dot subscript k divided by 28 W  

Q dot subscript k arrow  
Delta T divided by Delta t equals m dot times (h subscript 2 minus h subscript 1) plus Q dot subscript 2v minus W dot subscript v  

Q dot subscript 2v equals m dot times (h subscript 2 minus h subscript 1)  

Therefore, e subscript k equals m dot times (h subscript 2 minus h subscript 1) divided by 28 W
