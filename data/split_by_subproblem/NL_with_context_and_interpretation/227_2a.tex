A T-s diagram is drawn. The diagram includes labeled points and curves:  
- Point 0 is marked at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 by an upward curve labeled "isotherm."  
- Point 2 transitions to point 3 via a downward curve.  
- Point 3 transitions to point 4 via a straight line labeled "isobar."  
- Point 4 connects to point 5 with a curve.  
- Point 5 connects to point 6 with another curve.  
The x-axis is labeled "S" (entropy), and the y-axis is labeled "T" (temperature).  
A box labeled "wD" and "k*p*K" is drawn near the x-axis.
