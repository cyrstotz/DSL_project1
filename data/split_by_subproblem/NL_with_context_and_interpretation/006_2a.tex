A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T (K)" and the x-axis labeled as "s (kJ/kgÂ·K)". The graph represents a T-s diagram with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The curve starts at point 1, rises to point 2, then sharply increases to point 3. It descends to point 4, continues to point 5, and finally reaches point 6. The pressure difference between points 2 and 3 is labeled as "P23".
