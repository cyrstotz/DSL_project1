A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled phase regions. The vertical axis is labeled as "p [bar]" and the horizontal axis as "T [K]". Four points are marked in a rectangular cycle:  
- Point 1 is connected to Point 2 with the label "isobar".  
- Point 2 is connected to Point 3 with the label "isotherm".  
- Point 3 is connected to Point 4 with the label "isobar".  
- Point 4 is connected back to Point 1 with the label "isotherm".
