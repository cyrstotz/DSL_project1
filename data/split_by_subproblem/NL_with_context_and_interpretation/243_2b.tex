The equation for energy balance is written as:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} (h_5 - h_6 + w_5^2 / 2) + \dot{Q} - V_6 \).  

The velocity \( V_6 \) is calculated as:  
\( V_6 = \sqrt{(h_5 - h_6 + c \Delta x)} \).  

Further derivation is shown:  
\( V_6 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1} (p_6 v_6 - p_5 v_5)} = \frac{R (T_6 - T_5)}{n - 1} = \frac{\dot{m}}{M} \frac{(T_6 - T_5)}{n - 1} \).  

A calculation is performed:  
\( Q = \frac{2 \dot{m} c (273.15 - 30 + 43754)}{n - 1} = 47,875 \, \text{J/kg} \).  

Additional terms and variables are noted, including \( h_5 - h_6 = c_p (T_5 - T_6) \).
