A T-s diagram is drawn with the temperature (T) on the vertical axis labeled in Kelvin [K] and entropy (s) on the horizontal axis labeled in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin [kJ/kgÂ·K]. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process paths:  
- Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  
- The isobar for \( p_0 = p_6 \) is shown at the bottom.  
- The isobar for \( p_5 \) is higher up, and \( p_3 \) is the highest isobar.  
- Processes are labeled as isentropic (vertical lines) and isobaric (horizontal lines).  
- The path includes compression, heat addition, expansion, and mixing.  
- The process path from 0 to 1 is labeled as isentropic.  
- The path from 1 to 2 is labeled as isobaric.  
- The path from 2 to 3 is labeled as isentropic compression.  
- The path from 3 to 4 is labeled as isobaric heat addition.  
- The path from 4 to 5 is labeled as isentropic expansion.  
- The path from 5 to 6 is labeled as isentropic.
