Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "p".  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "T".  
   - Two horizontal lines are marked: one at "5 mbar" and another at "0.191 bar".  
   - A curved line represents the phase boundary, with two regions labeled "(i)" and "(ii)".  
   - The region "(i)" is above the horizontal line at "0.191 bar".  
   - The region "(ii)" is below the horizontal line at "5 mbar".  

2. The second diagram is a pressure-volume (p-V) graph.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "p".  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "V".  
   - A horizontal line is marked at "5 mbar".  
   - Two points are labeled "(i)" and "(ii)" along the line.
