Energy balance:  
Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by enthalpy difference plus heat flow minus work flow (crossed-out terms are ignored).  

Closed system:  
Mass at state 2 multiplied by specific internal energy at state 2 minus mass at state 1 multiplied by specific internal energy at state 1 equals mass flow rate multiplied by specific enthalpy at inlet plus heat flow minus work flow.
