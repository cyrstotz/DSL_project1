The equation for energy balance is written:  
"im Kreislauf = u2 minus u1 divided by h"  
"T2 = minus 22 degrees Celsius"  
"p3 minus p4"  
"Q dot equals zero bei Pverd" (heat flow equals zero at compression).  
"u arrow 1 Energiebilanz" (energy balance).  
The equation:  
"dE divided by dt equals m times (h2 minus h1) plus Q dot minus W dot."  
Further details:  
"h equals hf plus x times hfg (Joule)."  
"hf equals 53.42 kJ per kg."  
"Durchlauf: h equals u plus hfg."  
"hf (T/p)"  
"x equals h minus hf divided by hfg."  
"hf equals hf (T/p)."
