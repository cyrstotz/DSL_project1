A graph is drawn representing a T-s diagram. The diagram includes labeled isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_5 \), and \( p_{213} \). The process path is marked with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Arrows indicate isentropic and isobaric transitions between these points. The x-axis is labeled \( s \), and the y-axis is labeled \( T \).
