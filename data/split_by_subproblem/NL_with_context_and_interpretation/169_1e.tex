dS/dt equals m dot multiplied by (s1 minus s2) plus the summation of Q dot divided by T plus S dot erz.  

Delta S12 equals Delta m12 multiplied by (s1 minus s2) plus Q dot divided by T plus S dot erz.  

Delta S12 equals Delta m12 multiplied by (s1 minus s2).  

s1 minus s2 equals the integral from T2 to T1 of C divided by T dT, which equals C multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T1 divided by T2).
