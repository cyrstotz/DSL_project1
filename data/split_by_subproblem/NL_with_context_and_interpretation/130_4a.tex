Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 'T (k)' for temperature in Kelvin.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'p (bar)' for pressure in bar.  
   - Four points are marked: 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - Two horizontal lines connect points 1 to 2 and points 3 to 4, labeled as 'Isobar' (constant pressure).  
   - A curved line connects points 2 to 3, forming a dome-like shape.  

2. The second diagram is also a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 'T' for temperature.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'p'.  
   - Four points are marked: 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - Two horizontal lines connect points 1 to 2 and points 3 to 4.  
   - The dome-like curve is labeled with three regions:  
     - 'flüssigkeit' (liquid) on the left side.  
     - 'gesättigter dampf' (saturated vapor) on the right side.  
     - 'gesättigte dampf' (saturated vapor) at the top.
