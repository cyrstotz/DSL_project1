A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as pressure (p [bar]) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [K]) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, connected by lines representing different processes:  
- 1 to 2: Isentropic  
- 2 to 3: Isentropic  
- 3 to 4: Isobaric  
- 4 to 1: Pressure reduction
