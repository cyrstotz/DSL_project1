Exergy balance:  
Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by negative change in flow exergy plus the summation over j of one minus temperature j divided by temperature zero multiplied by heat flow rate j minus the summation of mass flow rate j multiplied by specific enthalpy j minus exergy loss rate.  

Exergy loss rate equals negative mass flow rate multiplied by change in flow exergy.  

Exergy loss equals negative change in flow exergy equals negative 100 kilojoules per kilogram.
