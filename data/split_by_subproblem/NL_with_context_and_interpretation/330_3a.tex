The pressure of the gas \( p_g \) is given as:  
\( p_g = p_{amb} + p_{piston} + p_{EW} \)  

The pressure \( p_g \) can also be expressed as:  
\( p_g = \eta_{bar} + \frac{A \cdot m_g}{A} + \frac{m_{EW} \cdot g}{A} \)  

The mass of the gas \( m_g \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
\( m_g = \frac{RT}{pV} \), where \( R = \frac{R}{M_g} \).
