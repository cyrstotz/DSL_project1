A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph shows a thermodynamic process with points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Between points 3 and 5, the process is labeled "isobar (geht durch 3)" (isobar, passes through 3).  
- Between points 5 and 6, the process is labeled "isobar".
