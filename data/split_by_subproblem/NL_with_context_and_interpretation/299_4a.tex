Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with labeled regions: "dampf" (vapor), "eis" (ice), and "wasser" (water). The graph includes lines separating these regions.  
2. The second diagram is another p-T graph with labeled points and regions: "dampf" (vapor), "wasser" (water), and "eis" (ice). Specific points are marked as "3" and "4", and arrows indicate transitions between states.
