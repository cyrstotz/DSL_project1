The velocity \( w_6 \) and temperature \( T_6 \) are to be calculated.  

Given data:  
- \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  

A note mentions "Balance in the boundary layer" and includes an equation:  
\[ \dot{m} = \dot{m}_{\text{in}} = \dot{m}_{\text{out}} \].  

Assumptions:  
- Mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) is constant.  
- \( p \cdot V^n \) is constant.
