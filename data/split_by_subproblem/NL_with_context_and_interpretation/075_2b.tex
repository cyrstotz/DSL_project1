The velocity w_6 and temperature T_6 of the gas are calculated.  

Given values:  
- w_5 = 220 meters per second  
- p_5 = 0.5 bar  
- T_5 = 431.9 Kelvin  
- p_0 = 0.191 bar  

The process is labeled "isentrop: S_5 → S_6".  

Equations:  
- m_dot * (h_5 - h_6) + (w_5 squared - w_6 squared) / 2 = 0  
- c_p * (T_5 - T_0) + (w_5 squared / 2 - w_6 squared / 2) = 0  

Constants:  
- κ = 1.4  

Polytropic relation:  
T_6 = T_5 * (p_6 / p_5) raised to the power of (κ - 1) / κ  
T_6 = 328.07 Kelvin  

Final calculations:  
w_6 = square root of [(1.006 * (T_5 - T_6) + w_5 squared / 2) * 2]  
w_6 = 220.17 meters per second  

Boxed results:  
T_6 = 328.07 Kelvin  
w_6 = 220.17 meters per second
