T mean equals integral from s c to s e of T dS divided by (s c minus s e) equals (h a minus h e) divided by (s c minus s e).  

T mean equals (T a minus T e) divided by ln(T a divided by T e).  
T mean equals (298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin) divided by ln(298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin).  
T mean equals 293.12 Kelvin.
