An equation is written:  
Partial derivative of E with respect to t equals the summation over i of mass flow rate m_i(t) multiplied by enthalpy h_i(t) plus kinetic energy k_i(t) plus potential energy p_i(t), plus the summation of heat flow Q_i(t), minus the summation of work flow W_i(t).  

Another equation is written:  
W_u equals mass flow rate m dot multiplied by (h_2 minus h_3).  

A third equation is written:  
T_2 equals T_i minus CU.  

Additional notes:  
- p_1 equals p_2.  
- p_3 equals p_4 equals delta p dot.
