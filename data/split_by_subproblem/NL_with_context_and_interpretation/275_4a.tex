Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram shows pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T(K)) on the horizontal axis. It includes phase regions with curves intersecting, representing different states of the refrigerant.  
2. The second diagram shows pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T(K)) on the horizontal axis, with a curve labeled "z" indicating a specific point or transition.
