E_C equals Q̇_zul divided by Ẇ_t equals Q̇_zul divided by (Q̇_zul minus Q̇_ab) equals Q̇_zul divided by Q̇_ab.  

E_C equals Q̇_K divided by Ẇ_K equals ṁ_R134a multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1) divided by 28 W.  

Energy balance evaporator:  
0 equals ṁ multiplied by (h_1 minus h_2) plus Q̇_c.  
Q̇_c equals ṁ multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1).
