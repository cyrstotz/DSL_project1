The page contains a T-s diagram with labeled isobars and process points. The diagram includes the following:  
- \( T[K] \) on the vertical axis and \( s[\text{kJ/kg·K}] \) on the horizontal axis.  
- Points labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \).  
- Isentropic processes are marked between \( 1 \) and \( 2 \), and between \( 5 \) and \( 6 \).  
- Isobaric processes are marked between \( 2 \) and \( 3 \), and between \( 4 \) and \( 5 \).  
- The temperature at point \( 5 \) is \( 431.9 \, \text{K} \), and the pressure is \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The pressure at point \( 0 \) is \( 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).

A T-s diagram is drawn with entropy (s) on the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kg·K]' and temperature (T) on the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The diagram includes several curves representing isobars: \( p_0 \), \( p_2 \), \( p_5 \), and \( p_6 \). Arrows indicate the process flow between states labeled as 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The curves show transitions between these states, with state 2 starting at a lower entropy and temperature, moving upward and to the right through the process.
