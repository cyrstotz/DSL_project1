The page contains two diagrams related to the freeze-drying process.  

**Diagram 1:**  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'T (°C)' and spans from negative temperatures to above zero.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'p (mbar)' and spans logarithmically from 0.01 to 1, 10, and beyond.  
- The diagram includes phase regions labeled as 'fest' (solid), 'flüssig' (liquid), and 'gas' (gas).  
- A curve labeled 'Tripel' (triple point) separates the solid, liquid, and gas regions.  
- There is a shaded region labeled 'flüssig gas' and a dashed line labeled 'Nassdampf gas' (wet steam gas).  

**Diagram 2:**  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'T (°C)' and spans from -30 to 0.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'p (mbar)' and spans logarithmically from 0.01 to 10.  
- The diagram includes phase regions labeled as 'fest' (solid), 'flüssig' (liquid), and 'gas' (gas).  
- A curve labeled 'Tripel' (triple point) separates the solid, liquid, and gas regions.  
- A note is written: '(ii) T_i -> T_i'.  

Both diagrams visually represent the phase transitions and conditions relevant to the freeze-drying process.
