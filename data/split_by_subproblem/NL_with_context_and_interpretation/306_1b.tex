T KF equals integral from s a to s e of T d s at constant pressure divided by integral from s a to s e of d h.  
Equals c f times (T a KF minus T e KF) equals c f times ln of (T a KF divided by T e KF).  

T KF equals 298.15 minus 288.15 divided by ln of (298.15 divided by 288.15) equals 293.12 Kelvin.
