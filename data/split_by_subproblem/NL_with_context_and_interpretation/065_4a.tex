A pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram is drawn. The diagram includes labeled regions and points:  
- "Fl√ºssigebiet" (liquid region) on the left.  
- "Mischgebiet" (mixture region) in the middle.  
- "Dampfgebiet" (vapor region) on the right.  
- A critical point labeled at the top of the curve.  
- Points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected by yellow lines to represent the process cycle.  
- The curve transitions between the liquid, mixture, and vapor regions.
