Second law of thermodynamics, stationary, adiabatic:  

Q equals s zero minus s six plus entropy production rate (S erz) implies entropy production rate equals s six minus s zero.  

Entropy production rate equals c p Luft multiplied by the natural logarithm of T six divided by T zero minus R h multiplied by the natural logarithm of p six divided by p zero.  

Entropy production rate equals 1.006 multiplied by the natural logarithm of 298.15 divided by 243.15 minus 0.3 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Entropy production rate equals 0.3 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Therefore, exergy loss equals T zero multiplied by entropy production rate equals 73.27 kilowatts per kilogram.
