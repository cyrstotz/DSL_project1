x two, ice equals the absolute value of U two minus U melt divided by U ice minus U melt, with T two equals 0.003 degrees Celsius.  

U two equals c V times (T two minus T one) plus U one, which equals 0.633 times (273.153 minus 773.15) plus (-333.442 plus x one times (-0.073 plus 333.442)).  
This equals minus 449.91 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Therefore, x two, ice equals the absolute value of 1 minus (-449.91 minus (-333.442)) divided by (-0.073 minus (-333.442)), which equals 0.3943, approximately 39.43 percent.
