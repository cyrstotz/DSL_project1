E_k = Q_k divided by v_t  

Q_k = m_R divided by M_R multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1) plus a_R divided by M_R multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1)  

a_R divided by M_R multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1) = 0.000837 multiplied by (231.7 minus 93.52 divided by 2) = 120.3163 divided by s_R  

E_k = 120.3163 divided by 28.0 = 4.30
