Thermodynamic mean temperature of the system: open, stationary, assuming ideal liquid.  

T KF in equals 288.15 Kelvin.  
T KF out equals 298.15 Kelvin.  

T KF equals integral from T KF in to T KF out of T dT divided by integral from T KF in to T KF out of dT.  

This simplifies to:  
T KF equals T KF out minus T KF in divided by ln of T KF out divided by T KF in.  

Substituting values:  
T KF equals (298.15 minus 288.15) divided by ln of (298.15 divided by 288.15) equals approximately 293.12 Kelvin.
