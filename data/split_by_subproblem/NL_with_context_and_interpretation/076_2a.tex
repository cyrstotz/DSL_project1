A T-s diagram is drawn with temperature (T in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and entropy (s in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled isobars and states:  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \)  
- \( p_1 = p_4 = p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( p_0 = p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  

The states are connected as follows:  
- State 1 to State 2 is labeled as "adiabatic."  
- State 2 to State 3 is labeled as "isentropic."  
- State 3 to State 4 is labeled as "isobar."  
- State 4 to State 5 is labeled as "isobar."  
- State 5 to State 6 is labeled as "isentropic."
