First law of thermodynamics for a closed system:  
Delta U equals Q one two minus W one two.  
Delta U equals m times c subscript V times (T two minus T one).  
Delta U equals 0.0034 times 0.633 times (0 minus 500).  
Delta U equals negative 1,076.1.  

W one two: Isobaric compression.  
W one two equals p one times (V two three minus V one three) equals 278.582 minus 285.54 joules.  

p two times V two three equals R times T two.  
V two three equals R times T two divided by p two equals 0.0011 cubic meters.  

T two equals 0 degrees Celsius.  
m one equals m two.  
p two equals p ambient.  

Q one two equals Delta U plus W one two.  
Q one two equals negative 1,076.1 joules minus 285.54 joules equals negative 1,361.64 joules.
