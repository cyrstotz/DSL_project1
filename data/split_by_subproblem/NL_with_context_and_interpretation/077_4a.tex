A diagram is drawn showing the freeze-drying process in a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram.  
- The diagram includes labeled regions: "solid," "liquid," and "gas."  
- The triple point is marked, and the pressure is indicated as "5 mbar under the triple point."  
- Points labeled "1," "2," and "3" are connected with arrows to show transitions.  
- The x-axis is labeled as temperature in degrees Celsius (Â°C), and the y-axis is labeled as pressure (p).  
- The process steps are described:  
  1) Isobar freezing: Pressure remains constant, temperature decreases, and the state is solid.  
  2) Isothermal sublimation: Pressure decreases, temperature remains constant, and the state is gas.
