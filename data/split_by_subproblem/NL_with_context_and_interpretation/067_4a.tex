A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p [bar]" and the x-axis labeled as "T [Â°C]". The graph shows a curve labeled "Tripel" (Triple Point). Two points are marked on the graph:  
- Point 1 is at 1 mbar.  
- Point 2 is below the curve at a lower pressure.  
The temperature \( T_i \) is marked on the x-axis.
