A T-s diagram is drawn with entropy (S) labeled on the x-axis in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K) and temperature (T) on the y-axis. The diagram includes labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left, representing the initial state.  
- Point 1 higher up, connected by a curve to point 2.  
- Point 2 connected to point 3 by another curve.  
- Point 3 connected to point 5 by a dashed line.  
- Point 5 connected to point 6 by another dashed line.  
The isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_5 \) are clearly marked.
