A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and processes. The diagram includes the following:  
- Axes labeled as 'T (K)' for temperature and 's (kJ/kgÂ·K)' for entropy.  
- Points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Processes labeled as:  
  - Between 1 and 2: 'adiabat s = const reversibel' (adiabatic, entropy constant, reversible).  
  - Between 2 and 3: 'isobar p2 = p3' (isobaric process).  
  - Between 3 and 4: 'adiabat in' (adiabatic process).  
  - Between 4 and 5: 'adiabat irreversibel' (adiabatic, irreversible).  
  - Between 5 and 6: 'isobar p6 = p0' (isobaric process).  
- Pressure values:  
  - At point 5: 'p5 = 0.5 bar'.  
  - At point 0: 'p0 = p6 = 0.1916 bar'.
