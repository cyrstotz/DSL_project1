A table is presented with the following columns labeled: P, T, S, and U. The rows are labeled with values of \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \):  

- \( x_1 = 1 \):  
  - P = 2.268  
  - T = -6  
  - S = 20045  
  - U = 26718, 93.42  

- \( x_2 = 1 \):  
  - P = 2.268  
  - T = 11  
  - S = 11  
  - U = (no value provided)  

- Row 3:  
  - P = 8  
  - T = 8  
  - S = (no value provided)  
  - U = (no value provided)  

- \( x_1 = 0 \):  
  - P = 8  
  - T = 8  
  - S = 26718, 93.42  
  - U = 11  

Below the table, a graph is drawn with axes labeled P (pressure) on the vertical axis and T (temperature) on the horizontal axis.  

The graph depicts a cycle with four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- Between states 1 and 4, the process is labeled "isobar."  
- Between states 4 and 3, the process is labeled "isobar."  
- Between states 3 and 2, the process is labeled "isobar."  
- Between states 2 and 1, the process is labeled "isobar."  

The graph shows a curved line connecting the states in a cycle.
