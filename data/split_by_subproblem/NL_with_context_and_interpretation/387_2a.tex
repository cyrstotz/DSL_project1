A temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram is drawn with labeled isobars.  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's (u/specific u)' and the y-axis is labeled as 'T (u)'.  
- Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 along the process curve.  
- Isobars are labeled as \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_5 \).  
- The curve shows compression, heat addition, expansion, and mixing processes.
