Thermodynamic mean temperature T_bar equals the integral of T multiplied by ds divided by (s_a minus s_e).  

No pressure change, so integral of T multiplied by ds equals Q_rev.  

T_bar equals Q_rev divided by (s_a minus s_e).  

T_bar equals c_p multiplied by (T_2 minus T_1) divided by c_p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_2 divided by T_1).  

T_bar equals (T_2 minus T_1) divided by the natural logarithm of (T_2 divided by T_1).  

T_bar equals (288.15 minus 288.15) Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of (288.15 divided by 288.15).  

T_bar equals 293.12 Kelvin.
