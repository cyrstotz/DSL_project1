\( T_{g,2} \), \( p_{g,2} \)  

\( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \), it is present in equilibrium.  

Short explanation:  
The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is exactly the equilibrium temperature of the EW, i.e., \( T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \). The thermal equilibrium is achieved (no heat flow). \( p_{g,2} \) remains constant because the piston weight and atmospheric pressure remain unchanged, and the volume of the ice-water mixture is constant.
