pV equals mRT  
(mEW plus mEis equals 0.16 kilograms)  
Sum of forces equals 0  

pg,1 times A minus 0.1 times g minus 32 times g minus pamb times A equals 0  

pg,1 equals (0.1 plus 32) times g divided by A plus pamb  

A equals (pi divided by 4) times D squared equals (10 times 10 to the power of -2) squared divided by 4 equals 0.0078 meters cubed  

pg,1 equals (0.1 plus 32) times g divided by 0.0078 plus 1.10 to the power of 5 equals 1.4 bar  

mg,1 equals pg,1 times Vg,1 divided by R divided by Tg,1  

R equals R divided by M equals 8314 divided by 50 equals 166.28  

mg,1 equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 times 3.14 times 10 to the power of -3 divided by 166.28 times 773 equals 0.0034 kilograms equals 3.4 grams

Energy balance:  
Q minus W equals delta U plus delta KE plus delta PE.  

Q12 equals W12 plus delta U12.  
Delta U12 equals U2 minus U1 equals m_g times (u2 minus u1) equals m_g times (c_V times (T_g,2 minus T_g,1)).  

Equals 3.6 times 10 to the power of negative 3 times 0.633 times (0.003 minus 500).  
Equals negative 1.14 kJ.
