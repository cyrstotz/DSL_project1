A T-s diagram is drawn with the temperature (T) on the vertical axis labeled in Kelvin [K] and entropy (S) on the horizontal axis labeled in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin [kJ/kgÂ·K].  

The diagram includes the following labeled points and processes:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 slightly above and to the right of point 0.  
- Point 2 further above point 1.  
- Point 3 at the top, connected to point 2 by an isobaric line.  
- Point 4 below point 3, connected by a vertical line labeled "isentropic."  
- Point 5 to the right of point 4, connected by an isobaric line.  
- Point 6 below point 5, connected by a vertical line labeled "isentropic."  

The diagram includes arrows indicating the direction of processes, and the isobars are labeled with pressure values, including "0.191 bar."
