rho times V equals m times R times T.  

m sub g equals p times V divided by R times T sub g,1 equals F divided by A times V sub g,1 divided by R times T sub g,1 equals (32.1 divided by 0.05 squared) times 3.14 divided by (50 times (500 plus 273.15)) equals 9.9825399 equals approximately 9.983 grams.  

p equals F divided by A equals F sub K plus F sub EW divided by A equals 4087.059939 divided by 0.05 squared equals approximately 4087 newtons per meter squared.
