A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis labeled in millibars [mbar] and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis labeled in degrees Celsius [Â°C].  

Key features of the graph:  
- The graph includes three regions labeled "gas," "water," and "ice."  
- The triple point is marked at the intersection of the three regions.  
- The line labeled "isotherm" runs vertically from the triple point upwards.  
- The line labeled "isobar" runs horizontally from the triple point to the right.  
- Points are marked as "1," "2," and "3" along the graph, with "(ii)" written near points 1 and 2.  
- The region labeled "Eis" (German for ice) is below the triple point.  
- The region labeled "Wasser" (German for water) is to the right of the triple point.
