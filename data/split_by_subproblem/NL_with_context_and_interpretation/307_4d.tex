The coefficient of performance (COP) is equal to the absolute value of the heat removed \( Q_K \) divided by the absolute value of the heat added \( Q_ab \), minus the absolute value of \( Q_K \).  

Equation:  
COP = \( |Q_K| / (|Q_ab| - |Q_K|) \)  

The energy balance is written as:  
0 = \( \dot{m}_{R134a} (h_3 - h_4) + Q_ab \)  

Where:  
\( Q_ab = \dot{m}_{R134a} (h_4 - h_3) \)  

Rewriting:  
0 = \( \dot{m}_{R134a} (h_1 - h_2) + Q_K \)  

Thus:  
COP = \( |h_3 - h_4| / (|h_3 - h_4| - |h_2 - h_1|) \)
