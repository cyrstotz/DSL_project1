A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states. The diagram includes:  
- Axes labeled as 'T [K]' for temperature and 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]' for entropy.  
- States 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked.  
- Isobars are labeled as \( p_0 \), \( p_5 = p_4 \), \( p_3 = p_2 \), and \( p_7 \).  
- The process paths are drawn, including compression, heat addition, and expansion.  
- A note is written: "blaue Kurve nicht beachten!" (Do not consider the blue curve!).
