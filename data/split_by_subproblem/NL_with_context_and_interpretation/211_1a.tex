1 → [box] → 2  
T1 = 70°C  
T2 = 100°C  

O = ṁ (h2 - h1) + Q̇ab → Q̇ab = ṁ (h2 - h1) = Q̇aus + Q̇R  
(remains in the system = 0)  

h2 = only the liquid portion exits:  
h2 (T = 100°C) = 418.04 kJ/kg  

h1:  
h1 (T = 70°C) = 292.88 kJ/kg  

=> Q̇ab = ṁ (h2 - h1) - Q̇R  
=> Q̇ab = 0.3 kg/s (418.04 - 292.88) kJ/kg - 100 kW  
= 107.818 kW

dE/dt equals plus Q dot implies delta V12 equals Qout,12.  

Delta m12 multiplied by (u2,E minus u1,E) plus mges multiplied by (u2,gas minus u1,gas) equals negative 35 MJ.  

Delta m12 multiplied by C multiplied by (T2 minus Tin,12) plus mges multiplied by C multiplied by (T2 minus Treactor,1) equals negative 35 MJ.  

Delta m12 multiplied by C multiplied by (T2 minus Tin,12) equals negative 35 MJ minus mges multiplied by C multiplied by (T2 minus Treactor,1).  

Delta m12 equals negative 35 MJ divided by C minus mges multiplied by (T2 minus Treactor,1) divided by C.  

Delta m12 equals negative 35 MJ divided by C minus mges multiplied by (u2,gas minus u1,gas) divided by (u2,k minus u1,k).  

ureactor,1 equals 418.94 kilojoules per kilogram plus 0.005 multiplied by (2506.5 minus 418.94) kilojoules per kilogram equals 423.38 kilojoules per kilogram.  

uk,1 equals 83.55 kilojoules per kilogram.  

u2 equals
