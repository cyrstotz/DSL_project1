The temperature would decrease because the removed heat flow extracts energy from the system. (At constant volume.)

Zero equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy at state 1 minus enthalpy at state 2) plus heat flow \( Q_K \).  

Heat flow \( Q_K \) equals negative mass flow rate times (enthalpy at state 1 minus enthalpy at state 2) equals 744.3 kilojoules per hour equals 120.3 watts.  

Coefficient of performance \( \epsilon_K \) equals absolute value of \( Q_K \) divided by absolute value of \( W_A \) equals 4.3.
