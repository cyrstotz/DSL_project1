Two pressure-temperature (p-T) diagrams are drawn.  
- The first diagram shows phase regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "gas" (gas). The triple point (TP) is marked, and the states 1 and 2 are indicated along the phase boundaries.  
- The second diagram is similar, with the same phase regions labeled and the triple point (TP) marked. States 1 and 2 are shown along the phase boundaries.
