p subscript g,1 equals 7.35 bar, m subscript g equals 3.6 kilograms.  
T subscript g,2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.  
T subscript 2 divided by T subscript n equals (p subscript 2 divided by p subscript n) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n.  
n equals c subscript p divided by c subscript v equals 0.63376 divided by 0.633 equals 1.00025.  
R equals c subscript p minus c subscript v equals R plus c subscript v.  
c subscript p equals 0.63376.  
p subscript 2 equals (T subscript 2 divided by T subscript n) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n times p subscript 1.  
The temperature is the same as the ice because the ice temperature cannot change with x greater than 0.
