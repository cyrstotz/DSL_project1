A graph is drawn with pressure (p) labeled in bar on the y-axis and temperature (T) labeled in degrees Celsius on the x-axis. The graph depicts the freeze-drying process with labeled points:  
- Point 1: Fluid  
- Point 2: Saturated vapor  
- Point 3: Superheated vapor  
The curve is labeled as "isotherm."
