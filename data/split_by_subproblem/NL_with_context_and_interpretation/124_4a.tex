A graph is drawn with pressure (p [bar]) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [K]) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows phase regions with labeled points:  
- Point 2 is marked on the left side of the graph.  
- Point 1 is marked in the middle of the graph.  
- Point 7 is marked on the right side of the graph.  
There is a horizontal line connecting points 2, 1, and 7, labeled as "T_inlet." The graph includes curved lines representing phase boundaries.
