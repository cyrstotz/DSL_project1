The equation for energy balance is written as:  
dE/dt = Σṁ (hi + ce^2/2 + gz) + Q̇ - Ẇ  

This is crossed out and replaced with:  
Q̇ = ṁ (he - ha) + Q̇ + Ẇ  

Further simplified to:  
ṁ = Ẇ - Q̇ / (he - ha)  

A table is provided with the following values:  
1: p = 0, T = 0, x = 0  
2: p = 8 bar, T = 1, x = 1  
3: p = 8 bar, T = 1, x = 0  

Additional notes:  
- Wärmeübertrager (heat exchanger)  
- 1 → 2: ṁ (he - ha) + Q̇ = 0 → Q̇ = ṁ (ha - he)  

Annotations include:  
- Ẇ = 28 W  
- Q̇i = ?  
- Q̇ab = ?
