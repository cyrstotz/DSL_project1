A T-s diagram is drawn with entropy (s) on the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]' and temperature (T) on the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The diagram includes six states labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  

- From state 0 to state 1: s decreases, T increases.  
- From state 1 to state 2: Isentropic process, s1 equals s2.  
- From state 2 to state 3: Isobaric process, T increases.  
- From state 3 to state 4: s increases.  
- From state 4 to state 5: p4 equals p5.  
- From state 5 to state 6: s5 equals s6.  

Additional notes are written next to the diagram:  
- 's = const' is marked between states 1 and 2, and between states 5 and 6.  
- 'p = p4 = p5' is marked between states 4 and 5.
