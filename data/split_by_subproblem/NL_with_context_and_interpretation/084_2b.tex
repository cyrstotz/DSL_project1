To determine w6 and T6:  
Air is treated as an ideal gas.  

Equation:  
p0 times v0 equals R times T0  

Constants:  
R_air equals 8.314 joules per mole-kelvin divided by molar mass_air equals 28.97 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms per mole.  

Result:  
R_air equals 287 joules per kilogram-kelvin.  

Further calculation:  
From 5 to 6, the process is isentropic.  

Equation:  
Sf equals S6  

Values:  
T5 equals 50 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals, 431.9 kelvin (from Table A-22).
