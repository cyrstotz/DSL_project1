A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars:  
- \( p = p_3 \)  
- \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  

The diagram includes points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, connected by arrows indicating the process flow. The axes are labeled:  
- \( T \, [\text{K}] \) on the vertical axis  
- \( S \, [\text{J/K}] \) on the horizontal axis  

A note is written:  
\( T_0 = 273.15 - 30 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \)
