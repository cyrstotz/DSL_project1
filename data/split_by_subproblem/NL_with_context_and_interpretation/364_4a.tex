Isobaric process:  
1-2: isobaric, T increases  
2-3: pressure increases, isentropic  
3-4: isobaric  
4-1: pressure decreases, enthalpy decreases, isothermal  

Diagrams:  
- Left diagram: A pressure-volume (p-V) graph with a looping curve.  
- Right diagram: A pressure-temperature (p-T) graph labeled with the following:  
  - Point 1: "x = 1, gas"  
  - Point 2: "x = 0, liquid"  
  - Curve labeled "isobaric" and "isentropic"  
  - Region labeled "ND" (near the bottom right corner)
