A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states.  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'S [kJ/K]' and the y-axis as 'T [K]'.  
- States 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the diagram.  
- Isobars are labeled as \( p_z \), \( p_1 \), \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), and \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The temperature values \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_0 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \) are indicated.  
- Entropy values are labeled as \( s_1 = s_2 \), \( s_3 = s_4 \), \( s_5 = s_6 \).
