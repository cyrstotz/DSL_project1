A graph is drawn with pressure (P [Pa]) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [K]) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes the following labeled regions:  
- "Go" (above the curve).  
- "Supercritical" (near the top right of the curve).  
- "Tripelpunkt" (near the middle of the curve).  
- "Fehl Fl√ºssig" (below the curve).
