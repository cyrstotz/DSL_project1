A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled phase regions. The diagram includes the following:  
- A vertical axis labeled as "p [bar]" and a horizontal axis labeled as "T [K]".  
- Points labeled as "1i", "2i", "3i", and "4i".  
- A curve connecting these points, representing the process steps.  
- The pressure at point "1i" is marked as "5 bar".
