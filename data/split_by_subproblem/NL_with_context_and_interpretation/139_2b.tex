Energy balance:  
u = ṁ (h_e - h_a - w_e squared / 2 - w_a squared / 2 + g (z_e - z_a)) + Q̇ - V̇ dp  
The terms "g(z_e - z_a)" and "V̇ dp" are crossed out with a note: "0, since volumetric work is not considered."  

q_B = Q̇_B / ṁ_K  
q_B = ṁ_K = Q̇_B = q_B  

ṁ_M / ṁ_K = 5.293 = 5.293 / 7 = ṁ_K = (5.293 / 7) ṁ

T_0: p v equals R T implies p divided by R equals constant implies T divided by v.  

T_6 equals T_5, due to adiabatic process.  

T_6 divided by v_6 equals T_0 divided by v_0.
