A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn. The diagram includes the following labeled elements:  
- A curve separating the "gas" phase from the "liquid" phase.  
- Points labeled "1", "2", and "3" along the curve.  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T [Â°C]" (temperature).  
- The y-axis is labeled as "p [mbar]" (pressure).
