Two diagrams are drawn, both labeled with axes and points.  

**First Diagram:**  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "S [kJ/kg·K]" (entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  
- The diagram shows a curve starting at point "0" and moving upwards to point "1".  
- Another curve starts at point "1" and moves upwards to point "2", labeled "isobar".  

**Second Diagram:**  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "S [kJ/kg·K]" (entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  
- The diagram shows a curve starting at point "0" and moving upwards to point "1".  
- A second curve moves from point "1" to point "3", labeled "isochoric".  
- The curve then descends from point "3" to point "4".  
- Another curve moves from point "4" to point "5".  
- Point "5" is connected to point "6" with a dashed line, labeled "T5 = 431.9 K".
