Question: \( \dot{Q}_{out} \)  

A diagram is drawn showing a reactor with inlet and outlet flows. The inlet temperature is labeled as 70 degrees Celsius, and the outlet temperature is labeled as 100 degrees Celsius. The inlet mass flow rate is \( 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \). The coolant enters at 288.15 Kelvin and exits at 298.15 Kelvin. The reactor contains pure water, and the steam quality is \( x = 0.005 \).  

The equation for energy balance is written:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_1 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_{out} \)  

The heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{out} \) is calculated:  
\( \dot{Q}_{out} = \dot{m} \cdot [h(70^\circ \text{C}) - h(100^\circ \text{C})] \)  
\( \dot{Q}_{out} = \dot{m} \cdot [292.98 - 415.04] \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
\( \dot{Q}_{out} = -37.818 \, \text{kJ/s} = -37.818 \, \text{kW} \)
