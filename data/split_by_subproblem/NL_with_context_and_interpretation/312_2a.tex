A graph is drawn with temperature (T) in Kelvin on the vertical axis and entropy (S) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The graph represents a thermodynamic process with six labeled states: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- State 0 is at the lowest entropy and temperature.  
- States 1, 2, and 3 show an increasing trend in both entropy and temperature.  
- States 4 and 5 show a decrease in entropy, while state 6 returns to the initial entropy level of state 0.  
- The isobars are marked as \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_1 = p_5 = p_4 \), and \( p_0 = p_6 \).  
- The word "Isobaren" (isobars) is written near the dashed lines representing constant pressure.
