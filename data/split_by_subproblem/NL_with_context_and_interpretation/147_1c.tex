Zero equals inlet mass flow rate multiplied by (entropy at state 2 minus entropy at state 1) minus heat flow divided by thermodynamic mean temperature plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals inlet mass flow rate multiplied by (entropy at state 2 minus entropy at state 1) plus heat flow divided by thermodynamic mean temperature.  

Zero equals inlet mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 1) plus heat flow.  

Inlet mass flow rate equals heat flow divided by (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 1), which equals 62.182 kilograms per second.
