A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states:  
- States 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked.  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_4 \), \( p_5 \), \( p_m \), \( p_0 = p_6 \).  
- A curved line labeled "richtlinie" connects states 5 and 6.  
- Axes are labeled: \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( S \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis.
