A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and processes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as 'T [K]' (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as '[u] [kJ/kgK]' (specific entropy).  
- The diagram includes curves labeled 'isobar', 'isentropic compression', 'non-isentropic compression', 'isentropic turbine', 'non-isentropic turbine', and 'isobaric mixing'.  
- Points are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 along the curves, corresponding to different states in the jet engine process.
