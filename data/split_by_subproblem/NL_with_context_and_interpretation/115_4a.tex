The page contains two diagrams:  

1. **Diagram 1 (Top)**:  
   - The graph is labeled with "Eis" (ice) and "Wasser" (water).  
   - There is a curve transitioning from "Eis" to "Wasser," indicating a phase change.  
   - A horizontal line labeled "Tripel" (triple point) intersects the curve.  
   - The x-axis is labeled "T" (temperature).  
   - The y-axis is not explicitly labeled but appears to represent pressure or another thermodynamic property.  

2. **Diagram 2 (Bottom)**:  
   - The graph includes a curve with a sharp transition.  
   - The x-axis is labeled "T" (temperature).  
   - The y-axis is labeled "p" (pressure).  
   - The diagram includes annotations such as "Tripel" (triple point) and "1000m, i," possibly indicating altitude or a specific condition.  
   - There is an arrow pointing downward labeled "200m."
