Entropy balance between coolant and reactor:  
dS/dt = Q dot out divided by T plus S dot erz  
→ both are not closed  

→ 0 = Q dot out divided by T plus S dot erz  
→ S dot erz = Q dot out divided by T KF = negative open bracket negative 37.838 kilowatts close bracket divided by 295 kelvin = 0.7283 kilojoules per kilogram kelvin
