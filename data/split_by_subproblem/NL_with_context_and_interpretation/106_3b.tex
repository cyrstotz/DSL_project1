Since the entire heat \( Q_{12} \) flows into the process of ice melting and equilibrium is always maintained, it follows that \( T_{2,Eis} = 0^\circ \text{C} \), and thus also \( T_{2,gas} = 0^\circ \text{C} \) (due to thermal equilibrium). The pressure remains constant in this configuration:  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).
