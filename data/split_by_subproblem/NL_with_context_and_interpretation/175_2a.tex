0-1 Isentropic: q equals 0  
1-2 Isentropic: q equals 0  
2-3 Isobaric: w equals 0  
3-4 Q equals 0, not isentropic  
4-5 Isobaric: w equals 0  
5-6 Isentropic  

A diagram is shown with the label "T-s diagram."  
The x-axis is labeled "s in kJ per kgÂ·K," and the y-axis is labeled "T in K."  
The diagram includes labeled regions:  
- "Isentropic" between points 0-1 and 5-6.  
- "Isobaric" between points 2-3 and 4-5.  
- A curved line labeled "3-4" with "Q equals 0."
