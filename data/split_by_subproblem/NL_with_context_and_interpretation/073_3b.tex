No heat flows anymore once all the ice has melted. The pressure remains constant.  

\( \Rightarrow \) Temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is equal to the temperature of the EW:  

\( \Rightarrow T_{g,2} = 0^\circ C \)  

The pressure of the gas remains constant:  

\( \Rightarrow p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 2.8 \, \text{bar} \)
