Perfect gas:  
p1 = pamb plus (32 times g) divided by (pi divided by 4 times D squared)  
= 1.40059 bar  

Ideal gas state:  
mg = p1 times Vg,1 divided by R times Tg,1  
R = R divided by Mg = 166.28 kilogram meter squared per second squared per kelvin  
= 1.40059 times 3.14 times 10 to the power of -3 divided by 166.28 times (500 plus 273.15)  
= 3.634 grams
