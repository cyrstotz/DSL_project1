The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) and pressure \( p_{g,2} \) are determined as follows:  
\[ T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \]  
Since the EW remains in the two-phase region, the temperature stays constant. As the entire system is in equilibrium, \( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

The pressure:  
\[ p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 14 \, \text{bar} \]  
Since the EW maintains the same mass and the piston weight and atmospheric pressure remain constant, the pressure remains unchanged.
