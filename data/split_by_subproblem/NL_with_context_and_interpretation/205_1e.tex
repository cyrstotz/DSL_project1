e) Entropy change:  

Delta S equals m times (s2 minus s1)  

s in equals s f of 70 degrees Celsius (from Table A-2)  

s out equals s f of 100 degrees Celsius (from Table A-2)  

System mass remains constant:  
Delta m equals 0

All is a half-open system.  
Delta E equals m total times u total minus m in times u in plus Q minus w equals 0.  

Minus Q plus w (motor work) equals m total times u total minus m in times u in equals delta m times u total minus u in.  

Delta m equals minus Q divided by (u total minus u in).  

h in and h total can be found in the table.
