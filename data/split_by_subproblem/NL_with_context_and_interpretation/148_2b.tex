The equation for energy balance is written:  
`w squared divided by 2 equals m dot times (h e plus w squared divided by 2)`  

Reference to 'Table A-22' is made.  

The enthalpy difference is calculated:  
`h e minus h a equals c p times (T2 minus T1)`  
`c p equals 1.006`  
`T2 minus T1 equals 526.948 minus 431.9`  
`h e minus h a equals 1.006 times (526.948 minus 431.9) equals 95.58 kilojoules per kilogram (kJ/kg)`  

Values are provided:  
`T1 equals 431.9 Kelvin (K)`  
`T2`  

The temperature ratio is calculated:  
`T2 divided by T1 equals (p2 divided by p1) to the power of (kappa minus 1 divided by kappa)`  
`T2 equals T1 times 1.22 equals 526.948 Kelvin equals T6`  

Further calculations:  
`95.58 kilojoules per kilogram plus 220 meters per second squared divided by 2 minus w a squared divided by 2 equals 0`  
`w a squared divided by 2 equals 95580 joules per kilogram plus 24200 joules per kilogram`

T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n.  

T6 divided by T5 equals (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4.  

T6 equals T5 multiplied by 0.759.  

T6 equals 327.81 Kelvin.  

m dot multiplied by (he minus ha plus we squared divided by 2 minus wa squared divided by 2) equals 0.  

he minus ha equals 104.71.  

wa squared divided by 2 equals 104710 joules per kilogram plus 24200 joules per kilogram.  

wa squared divided by 2 equals 128910 joules per kilogram.  

wa squared equals 257820 joules per kilogram.  

wa equals 507.76 meters per second.
