Delta ex_str equals u_6 minus u_0 minus T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0) plus p_0 multiplied by (v_6 minus v_0).  
u_6 minus u_0 equals c_p multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0).  
s_6 minus s_0 equals c_p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0).  

Delta ex_str equals c_p multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 multiplied by c_p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0) plus w_6 squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2.  

T_0 equals 243 Kelvin.  
Delta ex_str equals c_p multiplied by ((T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0)) plus w_6 squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta ex_str equals minus 11.0923 kilojoules per kilogram.
