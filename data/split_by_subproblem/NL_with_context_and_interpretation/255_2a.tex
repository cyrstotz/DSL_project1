The page contains two diagrams:  

1. **T-s Diagram** (Temperature vs. Specific Entropy):  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "T [K]" (Temperature in Kelvin).  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]" (Specific Entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  
   - A curve is drawn, representing the thermodynamic process qualitatively.  

2. **Detailed Process Diagram**:  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "T [K]" (Temperature in Kelvin).  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]" (Specific Entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  
   - Several points are marked and connected by lines, representing different states in the process:  
     - Points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
     - Isobars are drawn, labeled as "p0" and "p5 = p4".  
     - A zigzag line is drawn between points 5 and 6, indicating a mixing or turbulent process.
