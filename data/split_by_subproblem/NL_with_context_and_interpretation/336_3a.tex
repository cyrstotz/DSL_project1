A table is presented with the following columns: T, P, V, and X_ice.  

For the gas (g):  
- Row 1:  
  - T = 500 degrees Celsius  
  - P = 740,744 Pa  
- Row 2:  
  - T = T_end  

For the ice-water mixture (EW):  
- Row 1:  
  - T = 0 degrees Celsius  
  - X_ice = 0.6  
- Row 2:  
  - T = T_end  

Below the table:  

Pressure (p) is calculated using the formula:  
p = F / A  

Area (A) of the piston:  
A = pi * D^2 / 4  

D = 10 cm = 0.1 m  

A = (0.1 m)^2 * pi / 4 = 0.00785  

Force (F) is calculated as:  
F = m * a = (m_K + m_EW) * g = 374.9 N  

Gas pressure (p_g):  
p_g = p_amb + F / A = 740,744 Pa  

Mass of the gas (m_g):  
p * V = m * R * T  

R = R_specific = R_universal / M_g = 0.16628  

V = 3.14 L = 3.14 dm^3 = 0.00314 m^3  

m = p * V / (R * T) = 3.422 kg
