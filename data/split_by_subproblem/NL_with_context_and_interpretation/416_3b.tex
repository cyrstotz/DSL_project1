\( T_{g,2} = T_{EW,2} = 0.0^\circ \text{C} \)  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \)  

- The pressure from outside is the same as in state 1.  
- Since there is still ice in the water, all heat is used for melting.  
- In equilibrium, the temperature does not change further, and the ice content remains constant.
