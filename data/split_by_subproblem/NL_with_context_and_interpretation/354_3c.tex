\( C_{p,\text{gas}} = \frac{R}{M} + c_v = 799.28 \, \text{J/kgÂ·K} \).  

\( m_g (h_{n2} - h_{n1}) = m_g (h_{n2} - h_{n1}) \).  
\( m_g c_p (T_2 - T_1) = m_g c_p (T_2 - T_1) \).  

Since in state 2, water is still at \( 0^\circ C \) and state 2 is the equilibrium state, the gas is also at \( 0^\circ C \).  

\( Q_{12} = m_g (h_{n2} - h_{n1}) \).  
\( = m_g c_p (T_2 - T_1) \).  
\( T_2 - T_1 = 500 \, \text{K} \).  

\( = 1366.77 \, \text{J} \).
