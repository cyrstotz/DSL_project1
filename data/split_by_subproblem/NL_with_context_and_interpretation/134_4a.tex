The page contains several diagrams and equations related to Task 4.  

1. A pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram is drawn with labeled points.  
   - The diagram shows a curve with points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4".  
   - The curve transitions between different states, indicating processes in the freeze-drying cycle.  

2. Another diagram is drawn with axes labeled "p" and "T".  
   - Points "1", "2", "3", and "4" are connected, forming a cycle.  
   - The process transitions are marked with arrows, indicating directionality.
