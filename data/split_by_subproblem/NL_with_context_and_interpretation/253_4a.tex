A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points:  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.  
- Points 2 and 4 are close together on the curve.  
- Point 3 is above points 2 and 4, with an arrow indicating movement upward.  
Arrows indicate transitions between the points, showing the process flow.
