Entropy balance must be applied:  
O equals the sum of Q dot divided by T sub s plus S dot erz.  

A diagram is shown with arrows labeled as follows:  
- T KF,in (coolant inlet temperature)  
- T KF,out (coolant outlet temperature)  
- Q dot out (heat flow out)  
- T aus (temperature leaving the system)
