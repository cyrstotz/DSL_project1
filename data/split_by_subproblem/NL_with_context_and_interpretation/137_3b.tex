Since ice is still present, \( T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

The system is isobaric because the piston is movable:  

\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.3897 \, \text{bar} \)  

Thermodynamic equilibrium is reached, and ice remains, so everything is at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \):  

\( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).
