Cooling jacket: closed system, steady-state flow process in equilibrium.  

0 equals m dot times (s_e minus s_a) plus Q dot_out divided by T plus S dot_erz.  

S dot_erz equals m dot times (s_a minus s_e) minus Q dot_out divided by T.  
S dot_erz equals 212.77 joules per second.  

Entropy production occurs between the reactor and cooling jacket, not only in the cooling jacket.
