A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as \( T_{in} \, \text{OK} \) (temperature in Kelvin) and the x-axis unlabeled. The graph contains several curves, resembling thermodynamic processes. Below the graph, the text "75 in 17 kÂ·kg" is written.

w6, Q, T6  
w5 = 220 meters per second  
p5 = 0.5 bar  
T5 = 431.9 Kelvin  

T6 / T5 = (p6 / p5)^(k-1 / k)  
T6 = (p6 / p5)^(k-1 / k) = 328.07 Kelvin  

h5 + w5 squared / 2 = h6 + w6 squared / 2  
w6 squared / 2 = h5 - h6 + w5 squared / 2  
w6 squared / 2 = cp(T5 - T6) + w5 squared / 2  
w6 = square root of [2(cp(T5 - T6) + w5 squared / 2)]  
w6 = 507.25 meters per second
