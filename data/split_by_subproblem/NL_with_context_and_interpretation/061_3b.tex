\( p \cdot V = m \cdot R \cdot T \quad \Rightarrow \quad T: \)  

The ice-water mixture (EW) consists of ice and water.  
\( T_{\text{EW}} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  

No heat exchange occurs anymore.  
\( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \)  

Pressure:  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \) since \( p_{amb} \) remains constant and the mass of the weight and the EW remains constant.  
\( \Rightarrow p_{g,2} = 7.407 \, \text{bar} \)
