A graph is drawn with pressure (P [bar]) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [K]) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts phase regions labeled as "sol." (solid), "fl." (fluid), and "gas." Points labeled as "1," "2," and "3" are marked along the curve, with arrows indicating transitions between these states.
