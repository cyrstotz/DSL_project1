The diagram is a T-s (temperature-entropy) graph with labeled points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The x-axis is labeled as "s (kJ/kgÂ·K)" and the y-axis is labeled as "T (K)". The graph shows curved lines representing isobars, with dashed orange lines indicating the isobaric regions. The process path is drawn with solid blue lines connecting the points in sequence.  

Below the graph, the following equations and expressions are written:  

\[
\dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \left( h_e - h_a + \frac{1}{2} w_5^2 - \frac{1}{2} w_6^2 \right) = 0
\]

\[
h_a - h_e = c_p (T_2 - T_1) = 1.006 \cdot (T_6 - T_5)
\]

\[
T_6 = T_5 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}
\]
