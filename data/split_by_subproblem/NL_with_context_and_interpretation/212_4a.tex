A graph is drawn with axes labeled as \( p \) [\( p_0 \)] on the vertical axis and \( T \) [K] on the horizontal axis. Four points are marked on the graph: 1, 2, 3, and 4. The points are connected in a cycle, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.

The coefficient of performance \( \varepsilon_c \) is calculated as:  
\( \varepsilon_c = \dot{Q}_K / (\dot{Q}_{AB} - \dot{Q}_{zu}) = \dot{Q}_K / (\dot{Q}_{AB} - \dot{W}_K) = 0.02 \).
