Tg equals 500 degrees Celsius.  
Vg equals 3.14 liters.  

pg times Vg equals Mg times R divided by M times Tg.  

A equals (D divided by 2) squared times pi equals 0.00785 square meters.  

Force equilibrium:  
Diagram shows a cylinder with arrows indicating forces acting on the piston and membrane.  
- pamb times A (ambient pressure force) acts downward.  
- Mg times g (mass of piston times gravity) acts downward.  
- pg times A (gas pressure force) acts upward.  

In equilibrium:  
pg times A equals pamb times A plus Mg times g.  

pg equals pamb plus Mg times g divided by A.  
g equals 9.81 meters per second squared.  

pg equals 139,870 pascals.  
pg equals 1.4 bar.  

Mg equals pg times Vg divided by (R divided by M times Tg).  
Mg equals 3.429 grams.  
Mg equals 3.42 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms.  

pg equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals.  
Vg equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.  

R equals 8.314 joules per mole per kelvin.  
M equals 50 kilograms per kilomole.  
Tg equals 773.15 kelvin.
