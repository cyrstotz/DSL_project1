Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The graph includes labeled isobars and phase regions.  
   - Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked along the curve.  
   - The region between points 1 and 2 is labeled "x = 0" and "x = 1".  
   - The isobar at "p = 5 bar" is indicated.  

2. The second diagram is another pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - An isobar labeled "8 bar" is drawn.  
   - Points 1, 2, and 3 are marked.  
   - The region between points 1 and 2 is labeled "x = 0" and "x = 1".
