A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled as "T" (temperature) and the horizontal axis labeled as "s" (entropy). The graph appears to depict a qualitative T-s diagram with curves and arrows indicating thermodynamic processes. Specific points are marked, but their labels are unclear.

h2 equals h (328.075 K)  
equals h (320 K) plus 8.075 times (h (350 K) minus h (320 K)) divided by 10  

equals 320.29 kilojoules per kilogram plus 8.075 times (320.36 kilojoules per kilogram minus 320.25 kilojoules per kilogram) divided by 10  

equals 328.405 kilojoules per kilogram  

w5 equals velocity 5 equals 220 meters per second  

w6 equals square root of (2 times (h2 minus h5) plus w5 squared)  

equals 220.47 meters per second
