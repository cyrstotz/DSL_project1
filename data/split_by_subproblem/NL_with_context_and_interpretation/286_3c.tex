p_2 equals p_1 times (T_2 divided by T_1) raised to the power of n divided by n minus 1.  
n equals c_p divided by c_v equals 0.79928 divided by 0.633 equals 1.263.  

p_2 equals p_1 times (T_2 divided by T_1) raised to the power of n divided by n minus 1 equals 0.37 bar times (273.15 kelvin divided by 773.15 kelvin) raised to the power of 1.263 divided by 0.263 equals 9.47 times 10^-3 bar.

Q twelve equals W twelve.  
Q twelve equals the integral from one to two of p dV equals R times (T two minus T one) divided by one minus n.  
Q twelve equals R times (T two minus T one) divided by one minus n equals zero point four six six two eight times (seven hundred seventy-three point one five minus two hundred seventy-three point one five) divided by one minus one point two six three.  

Equals eight point three four one times (seven hundred seventy-three point one five minus two hundred seventy-three point one five) divided by one minus one point two six three times ten to the power of three.  

Equals negative two five eight zero six point one four.  
Equals negative one thousand five hundred eighty point six joules.
