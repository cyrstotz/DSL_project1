The diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with the following elements:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as 'p (bar)'.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
- A curve is drawn, starting at point '1' and moving downward to point '2'.  
- The curve is divided into two segments:  
  - Segment 'i' is labeled as "schaar Î”T < 0" (sharp, delta T less than zero).  
  - Segment 'ii' is labeled as "ist isotherm" (is isothermal).  
- An isotherm line is marked near the top of the graph.  
- Point '6' is indicated along the curve, closer to point '1'.
