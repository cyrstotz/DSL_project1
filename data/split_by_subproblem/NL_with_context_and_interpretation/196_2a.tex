A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's (kJ/kg·K)'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T (K)'.  

The diagram includes six states (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) connected by various processes:  
- Between states 0 and 1: 'isobar'.  
- Between states 1 and 2: 'adiabat, reversible, isentrop'.  
- Between states 2 and 3: 'isobar'.  
- Between states 3 and 4: 'adiabat, irreversible, 0.5 bar, Δs ≠ 0'.  
- Between states 4 and 5: 'isobar'.  
- Between states 5 and 6: 'isentrop'.

\( T_0 = 283.15 \, \text{K} \)  

\( \Delta ex_{str} = (85.493 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 283.15 \, \text{K} \cdot (0.303 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}) + \frac{(357.294 \, \text{m/s})^2}{2} - \frac{(700 \, \text{m/s})^2}{2}) \)  

\( = 85.493 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 73.7272 \, \text{kJ/kg} + 123.688 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 257.296 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 70 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

\( = -120.005 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)
