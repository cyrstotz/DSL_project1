The problem asks for \( w_6 \) and \( T_0 \).  

Adiabatic, reversible implies \( s = const \).  

The equation for \( T_6 / T_5 \) is given as:  
\( T_6 / T_5 = (p_6 / p_5)^{(n - 1) / n} \).  

The equation for \( T_6 \) is derived as:  
\( T_6 = T_5 \cdot (p_6 / p_5)^{(n - 1) / n} \).  

Substituting values:  
\( T_6 = 431.9 \cdot (0.5 \, \text{bar} / 0.191 \, \text{bar})^{(1.4 - 1) / 1.4} \).  

Result:  
\( T_6 = 562.6 \, \text{K} \).  

\( s = const \).  

Energy balance equation:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} \cdot (u_5 - u_6 + w_5^2 - w_6^2 / 2) \).

Two times mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 5 minus enthalpy at state 6) plus mass flow rate multiplied by (velocity at state 5 squared divided by two) equals mass flow rate multiplied by velocity at state 6 squared divided by two.  

h5 (431.9, 0.5 bar) equals enthalpy at 435 minus enthalpy at 430 divided by (305 minus 300) multiplied by (431.9 minus 430) plus enthalpy at 430.  

h5 (431.9, 0.5 bar) equals enthalpy at 440 minus enthalpy at 430 divided by (440 minus 430) multiplied by (431.9 minus 430) plus enthalpy at 430.  

Equals (444.61 minus 431.43) multiplied by (1.9) divided by 10 plus 431.43.  

Equals 433.36.  

h6 (-30 degrees Celsius, 0.191 bar) equals enthalpy at 250 minus enthalpy at 240 divided by (250 minus 240) multiplied by (247.75 minus 240) plus enthalpy at 240.  

Equals 250.05 minus 240.02 divided by (250 minus 240) multiplied by (3.15) plus 240.02.  

Ideal gas: enthalpy at T2 minus enthalpy at T1 equals Cp multiplied by (T2 minus T1).  

Therefore, velocity at state 6 squared equals two multiplied by Cp multiplied by (T6 minus T5) plus velocity at state 5 squared.  

Velocity at state 6 equals the square root of two multiplied by 1.006 multiplied by (568.6 minus 431.9) plus (220 squared).  

Equals 226.6 meters per second.  

Equals 568.71 meters per second.
