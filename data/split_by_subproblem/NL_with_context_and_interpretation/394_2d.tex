Exergy loss equals T subscript 0 multiplied by entropy change.  

Entropy change equals (s subscript 4 minus s subscript 2) minus q subscript B divided by T subscript B.  

Entropy change equals c subscript p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 4) minus q subscript B divided by T subscript B.
