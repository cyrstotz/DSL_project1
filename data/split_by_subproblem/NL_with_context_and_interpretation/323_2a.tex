Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is labeled "T-S" (temperature-entropy) and shows a qualitative process. It includes numbered points (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) and labeled regions:  
   - "Isentrop" (isentropic)  
   - "Isobar" (isobaric)  
   - A dashed line connects points.  
   - The process transitions between states, with arrows indicating flow.  

2. The second diagram is labeled "T-p" (temperature-pressure) and includes numbered points (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). It shows:  
   - "Isobar" (isobaric) processes between points 3 and 4.  
   - "Adiabatic" process between points 2 and 3.  
   - "Isentrop" (isentropic) process between points 1 and 2.  
   - A dashed line connects points.
