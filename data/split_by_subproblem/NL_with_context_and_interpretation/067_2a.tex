A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The diagram includes curved lines representing isobars, labeled with \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \). The x-axis is labeled \( s \, [\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}] \), and the y-axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \). A note indicates that the star symbol (*) represents isobars.
