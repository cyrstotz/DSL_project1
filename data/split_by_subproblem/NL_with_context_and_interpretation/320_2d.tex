ex_verl equals T_0 multiplied by s_verl.  

Zero equals q_B divided by T_B plus s_verl.  

s_verl equals q_B divided by T_B which equals 1195 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 1289 Kelvin which equals 0.927 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

ex_verl equals 303.15 Kelvin multiplied by 0.927 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin which equals 281.1 kilowatts.
