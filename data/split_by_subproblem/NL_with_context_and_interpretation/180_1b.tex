Thermodynamic mean temperature:  
T bar equals integral of Q divided by T out over S a minus S e.  

T bar equals h a minus h e divided by S a minus S e.  

T bar equals two hundred ninety-three point two one four Kelvin.  

S a (from table A-2) equals zero point three eight four kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
S e (from table A-2) equals zero point two two four five kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

h e (from table A-2) equals sixty-two point five five kilojoules per kilogram.  
h a (from table A-2) equals one hundred twenty-four point eight five kilojoules per kilogram.
