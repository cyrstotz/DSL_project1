\( T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  

Because the ice content \( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \), the temperature remains at 0Â°C.  

\( p_{EW,2} = p_{g,1} = 135565.5 \, \text{Pa} \)  

The force acting on the system and the area of the cylinder, as well as the volume of the ice-water mixture (EW), remain constant, and therefore the pressure also remains constant.
