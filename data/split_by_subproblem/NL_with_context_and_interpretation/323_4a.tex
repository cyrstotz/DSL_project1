A pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram is drawn. The diagram includes labeled phase regions and processes:  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 with an isentropic curve labeled "Isentrop."  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 with an isobaric curve labeled "Isobar."  
- Point 3 is connected to point 4 with another isobaric curve labeled "Isobar."  
- Point 4 is connected back to point 1 with an isentropic curve labeled "Isentrop."  
The x-axis is labeled "T" (temperature), and the y-axis is labeled "p" (pressure).  
The region near point 2 is labeled "ND."
