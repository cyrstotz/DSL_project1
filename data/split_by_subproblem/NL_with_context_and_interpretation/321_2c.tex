Delta exergy flow equals h six minus h zero minus T zero multiplied by (s six minus s zero) plus w six squared minus w zero squared divided by two.  

h six minus h zero equals c p of air multiplied by (T six minus T zero) equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by (328.16 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin) equals 85.4597 kilojoules per kilogram.  

T zero multiplied by (s six minus s zero) equals T zero multiplied by (s five minus s zero) equals T zero multiplied by (c p of air multiplied by ln of T six divided by T zero minus R multiplied by ln of p six divided by p zero).  

p six equals p zero.  

243.15 Kelvin divided by 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by ln of (328.1 Kelvin divided by 243.15 Kelvin) equals 73.2946 kilojoules per kilogram.  

w six squared minus w zero squared divided by two equals 507.1 meters squared per second squared minus 200 meters squared per second squared divided by two equals 108620.85 joules per kilogram equals 108.621 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy flow equals 85.4597 kilojoules per kilogram minus 73.2946 kilojoules per kilogram plus 108.621 kilojoules per kilogram equals 120.786 kilojoules per kilogram.
