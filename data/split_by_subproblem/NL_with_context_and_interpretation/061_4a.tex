A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis. The graph shows phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). A curve separates the solid and liquid phases, with annotations "geschmolzen" (melted) and "noch nicht geschmolzen" (not yet melted). Another curve separates the liquid and gas phases, with the annotation "Schluss" (end).
