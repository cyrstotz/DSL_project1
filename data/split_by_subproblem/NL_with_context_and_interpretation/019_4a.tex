A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn. The y-axis is labeled as 'P [bar]' and the x-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'. The diagram shows a dome-shaped curve representing phase regions. Points labeled '1', '2', '3', and '4' are marked along the curve and outside of it. Point '1' is on the left side of the curve, point '2' is at the bottom right of the curve, point '3' is above the curve, and point '4' is on the right side of the curve. The region inside the dome is shaded, and the label 'isobar' is written near the curve.

COP equals Q dot cool divided by W dot t equals Q dot cool divided by Q dot t minus Q dot cool.
