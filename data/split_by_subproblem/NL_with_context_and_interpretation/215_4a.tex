A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn. The diagram includes labeled regions:  
- "flüssig" (liquid)  
- "gasförmig" (gaseous)  
The diagram shows two steps:  
- Step (i): A vertical line moving upward from the "gasförmig" region into the "flüssig" region.  
- Step (ii): A horizontal line moving leftward from the "flüssig" region into the "gasförmig" region.  
Additional labels:  
- "test" near the intersection of steps (i) and (ii).  
- "5 mbar" is marked below the horizontal line of step (ii).  
- "10K" is marked below the horizontal line of step (ii).  
- "Ti" is marked on the temperature axis.
