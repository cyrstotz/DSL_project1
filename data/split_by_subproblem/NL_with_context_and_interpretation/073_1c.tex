Entropy balance:  
O equals Q aus divided by T KF plus S erz.  
S erz equals Q aus divided by T KF plus Q R divided by T Reactor,1.  
S erz equals (Q aus divided by T KF) plus (Q R divided by T Reactor,1).  
S erz equals (100,000 W divided by 293 K) plus (100,000 W divided by 373.15 K).  
S erz equals 47.64 W per K.
