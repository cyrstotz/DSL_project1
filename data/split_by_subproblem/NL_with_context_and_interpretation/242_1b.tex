Thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant stream:  
Mean temperature equals integral of entropy change divided by temperature difference between outlet and inlet.  

Entropy change equals integral of enthalpy change divided by temperature difference plus pressure-volume work (neglected here).  

Entropy change equals integral of enthalpy change divided by temperature difference.  
Entropy change equals specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at outlet minus temperature at inlet) divided by logarithm of temperature ratio.  

Mean temperature equals temperature at outlet minus temperature at inlet divided by logarithm of temperature ratio.  
Mean temperature equals 288.15 Kelvin minus 298.15 Kelvin divided by logarithm of temperature ratio.  
Mean temperature equals 283.124 Kelvin.
