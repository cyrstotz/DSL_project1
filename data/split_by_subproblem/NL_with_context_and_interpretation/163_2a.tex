**Diagrams:**
Three diagrams are drawn, labeled with axes and annotations:
1. The first diagram shows a curve labeled "T_s" (temperature) on the y-axis and "s_k,s_k,s_k" (entropy) on the x-axis. Points are marked as "2,3,4" with arrows indicating transitions between states. Additional annotations include "N_w" and "Isobar."
2. The second diagram has similar axes ("N_w" and "s_k,s_k,s_k") with points labeled "0,1,2,3,4,5." Arrows indicate transitions, and "Isobar" is written near the curve.
3. The third diagram is labeled "(a)" with "T_s" on the y-axis and "s_k,s_k,s_k" on the x-axis. Points are marked "0,1,2,3,4,5" with annotations "p_3,p_0,p_5,p_0,p_0."

**Equations and Text:**
"Energiebilanz um Schubdüse  
Düse = -Drossel Keine Arbeit  

Q = m_gas (h_5 - h_6 + w_5 squared - w_6 squared divided by 2) = 0 = 0  
1 divided by m_gas  
Q = m_gas (h_5 - h_6 + Delta RE + Q_45 - W_45) -> h_6 - h_5 = w_5 squared - w_6 squared divided by 2  

Isentrop Adiabatic reversed  
n = k + 1 divided by k - 1  

T_6 divided by T_5 = (p_6 divided by p_5) to the power of (n - 1 divided by n) -> T_6 = T_5 * (p_6 divided by p_5) to the power of (0.4 divided by 1.4) = 431.9 * (0.5 divided by 0.5) to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4 = 328.1 K  

h_6 - h_5 (ideal gas) = c_p Luft (T_6 - T_5) = 1.006 * (w_5 squared divided by 2) * (328.1 K - 431.9 K) = -104.145 K."
