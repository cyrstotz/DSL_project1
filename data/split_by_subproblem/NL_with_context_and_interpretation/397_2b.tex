From the energy balance:  
0 = \( \dot{m} \) [he - ha + (we squared - wa squared) divided by 2] I + \( \sum \dot{Q}_j \) - \( \sum \dot{W}_{en} \) = 0.  

\( \dot{Q}_j \) term is crossed out.  

\( \dot{W}_t = 0 \).  
q = 1195 kJ/kg.  
we = wLuft = 200 m/s.  

(we squared - wa squared) divided by 2 = ha - he - q.  
= cpL (Ta - Te) - q.  

From 5 to 6: Isentropic process.  
T6 divided by T5 = (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n - 1 divided by n).  
= (p0 divided by p5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4.  
= [0.191 divided by 0.5] raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4.  
= 0.76.  

T6 = T5 multiplied by 0.76 = 0.76 multiplied by 431.9 K = 328.07 K.

The equation for \( w_6^2 - w_5^2 \) divided by 2 is given as:  
\( Cp \cdot (T_6 - T_5) \)  
\( = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \cdot (328.07 - 431.91) \, \text{K} \)  
\( = -104.45 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

The velocity \( w_6 \) is calculated as:  
\( w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot (-104.45 \, \text{kJ/kg}) + w_5^2} \)  
\( = 510 \, \text{m/s} \).
