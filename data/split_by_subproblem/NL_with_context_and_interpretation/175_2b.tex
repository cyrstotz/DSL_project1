0 equals m-dot multiplied by (h_0 minus h_6) plus (w_e squared minus w_a squared) divided by 2 times rho_0 plus Q-dot_j minus W-dot_tn.  
- Adiabatic to the outside: Q-dot_j equals 0  

W-dot_tn equals m multiplied by (h_5 minus h_6) plus (w_e squared minus w_a squared) divided by 2.  

[W_tn divided by m plus (h_6 minus h_5)] multiplied by 2 equals w_e squared minus w_a squared.  

w_0 squared equals w_5 squared minus W_tn divided by m-dot plus [h_5 minus h_6].  

v_5 equals m multiplied by R multiplied by T_5 divided by p_5.  
v_5 equals (0.1286 joules per gram multiplied by 431.9 kelvin) divided by (0.5 times 10^5 pascal).  
v_5 equals 0.10024789 cubic meters per gram.  

T_6 divided by T_5 equals (p_6 divided by p_5) raised to the power of (kappa minus 1 divided by kappa).  
Therefore, T_6 equals T_5 multiplied by (p_6 divided by p_5).  
T_6 equals 328.107 kelvin.  

h_6 minus h_5 equals c_p multiplied by (T_6 minus T_5).  

h_5 minus h_x equals c_p multiplied by (T_5 minus T_6).  
h_5 minus h_x equals (1.006 kilojoules per kilogramÂ·K) multiplied by (431.9 kelvin minus 328.107 kelvin).  
h_5 minus h_x equals 104.143 kilojoules per kilogram.

\( w_6^2 = w_5^2 - \dot{W}_{en} / \dot{m} + [h_5 - h_6] \)  

\( \dot{W}_{en} = R(T_6 - T_5) = 0.12367 \, \text{J/g} \, [328.07 \, \text{K} - 431.13 \, \text{K}] / 0.4 \)  

\( = -741.42 \, \text{J/g} \)  

\( w_6 = \sqrt{(200 \, \text{m/s})^2 + 741.42 \, \text{J/g} + 104.45 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2} \)
