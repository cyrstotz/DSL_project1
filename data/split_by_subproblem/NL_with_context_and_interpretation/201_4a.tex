A diagram is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p [bar]" and the x-axis labeled as "T [K]". The diagram shows a cycle with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The transitions between these points are as follows:  
- 1 → 2: isobar  
- 2 → 3: adiabatic rev → isentropic  
- 3 → 4: isobar  
- 4 → 1: isentropic
