A diagram is drawn showing a cross-section of a reactor wall labeled "Wand" (wall). Inside the reactor, "H2O" is written, and arrows indicate heat transfer labeled as "Qaus" (heat flow out). The cooling jacket is labeled "Kühlmittel" (coolant), and dashed lines represent boundaries.

Below the diagram, the heading "Bilanzgleichung: Entropiebilanz um die Wand:" (Balance equation: Entropy balance around the wall) is written.

Equations:  
Q equals Qaus divided by TH2O minus Qaus divided by TKF plus Ṡerg.  
TH2O equals TR equals 100 degrees Celsius equals 373.15 Kelvin.  
TKF equals 295 Kelvin.  

Ṡerg equals Qaus multiplied by (1 divided by TH2O plus 1 divided by TKF).  
Ṡerg equals 65 kilowatts multiplied by (1 divided by 295 Kelvin minus 1 divided by 373.15 Kelvin).  
Ṡerg equals 4.194 times 10 to the power of negative 2 kilowatts per Kelvin.

A table is drawn with columns labeled Q, W, Z, and T.  
Rows:  
- Row 0: No values.  
- Row 1: T equals 100 degrees Celsius.  
- Row 2: T equals 70 degrees Celsius.  

Below the table:  
ΔM12 equals 35 megajoules.
