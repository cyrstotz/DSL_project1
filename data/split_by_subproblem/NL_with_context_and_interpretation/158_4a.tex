A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The x-axis is labeled 'T [K]'.  
- The y-axis is labeled 'P [bar]'.  

The diagram represents the freeze-drying process, showing phase regions and transitions. Key points are labeled:  
- '1' corresponds to the evaporator.  
- '2' corresponds to the compressor.  
- '3' corresponds to the condenser.  
- '4' corresponds to the expansion valve.  

Additional annotations include:  
- 'gefrorene Trocknung' (frozen drying).  
- 'gefrorene Dampfdruck' (frozen vapor pressure).  
- 'Nassdampf Gebiet' (wet steam region).
