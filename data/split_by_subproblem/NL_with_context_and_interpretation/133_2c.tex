Equations and calculations are provided:  
- \( T_C = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_0} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} T_0 \), resulting in \( T_C = 328.075 \, \text{K} \).  
- \( w_C = w_6 = 437.427 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- \( v_s = \frac{R T_5}{P_5} = 0.0049 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \).  
Constants:  
- \( R = c_p - c_v = 0.2874 \).  
- \( \kappa = \frac{c_p}{c_v} \), \( c_v = \frac{c_p}{\kappa} = 0.749 \).

Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream at state 6 minus exergy stream at state 0.  

Delta exergy stream equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus temperature at state 0 multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0) plus change in kinetic energy).  

Delta exergy stream equals 87.829 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 equals specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at state 6 minus temperature at state 0), which equals 85.921 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Temperature at state 0 equals 243.15 Kelvin.  

Entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0 equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 0) minus gas constant multiplied by the natural logarithm of (pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at state 0), which equals 0.30136 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Change in kinetic energy equals velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2 minus velocity at state 0 squared divided by 2, which equals 75.621 kilojoules per kilogram.
