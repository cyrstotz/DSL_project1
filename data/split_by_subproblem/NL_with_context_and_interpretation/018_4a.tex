The diagram shows a p-T graph with labeled phase regions for the freeze-drying process.  
- The graph includes four states:  
  - State 1: Isobaric process at 1 bar.  
  - State 2: Isothermal and isobaric process.  
  - State 3: Isentropic process at 8 bar.  
  - State 4: Isobaric process at 8 bar.  
- The temperature \( T_i \) is calculated as \( T_i = 10 \, \text{K} + T_{\text{triple}} \), where \( T_{\text{triple}} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \).  
  - \( T_i = 283.15 \, \text{K} \).  
- The temperature \( T_2 \) is calculated as \( T_2 = T_i - 6 \, \text{K} \), resulting in \( T_2 = 277.15 \, \text{K} \).
