Since the ice is not completely melted, the heat transfer \( Q \) is zero because the temperature remains constant.  

The temperature and pressure must decrease since the heat flows from warm to cold.  

Gas and ice are in thermodynamic equilibrium: \( Q = 0 \).  

At \( T = 0^\circ \text{C} \), the gas must have the same temperature as the ice-water mixture (0°C), otherwise, no ice would remain, and the system would not be in equilibrium.  

\( p_{1} \cdot V_{1} / T_{1} = p_{2} \cdot V_{2} / T_{2} \)  

\( T_{2} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{1} = 773.15 \, \text{K} \)  

\( p_{2} = \frac{p_{1} \cdot V_{1} \cdot T_{2}}{T_{1} \cdot V_{2}} = \frac{2.37 \, \text{bar} \cdot 3.74 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3 \cdot 273.15 \, \text{K}}{773.15 \, \text{K} \cdot 3.74 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3} = 0.49 \, \text{bar} \)

p2 equals p1.  
T2 divided by T1 equals (p2 divided by p1) raised to the power of (κ minus 1) divided by κ.  
κ equals cp divided by cv equals 7.2637.  
cv equals 0.633.  
cp equals 8.314 divided by M equals 0.79958.  
p2 equals p1 implies the pressure through p0 and mass has not changed.
