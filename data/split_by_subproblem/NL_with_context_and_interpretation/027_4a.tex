A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled regions:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "P" (pressure).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
- A curve is drawn, separating different phases: solid, liquid, and gas.  
- The triple point (TP) is marked.  
- The solid region is labeled as "Solid is lower (under TP)."  
- The liquid region is labeled as "Isobar (freezing)."  
- The gas region is labeled as "Gas."  
- An arrow labeled "water curves back" points to the gas region.
