Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a T-s diagram (temperature vs. entropy).  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 's' (entropy).  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
   - Several isobars are drawn and labeled as \( P_0 \), \( P_5 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_4 \).  
   - Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 along the curves.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the process.  

2. The second diagram is a T-v diagram (temperature vs. specific volume).  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 'v' (specific volume).  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
   - Several isobars are drawn and labeled as \( P_0 \), \( P_5 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_4 \).  
   - Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 along the curves.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the process.
