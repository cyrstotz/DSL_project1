A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled phase regions.  
- The diagram includes a curve labeled "Tripel" (triple point).  
- The regions are labeled "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous).  
- Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked on the diagram, with arrows indicating transitions between states.  
- A line labeled "5 mbar" is drawn below the triple point.  
- The temperature axis is labeled \( T \), and the pressure axis is labeled \( p \).
