A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph represents a T-s diagram with several labeled points and curves:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 connected to point 0 by a curve labeled "p = p1".  
- Point 2 connected to point 1 by a vertical line labeled "p = p2".  
- Point 3 connected to point 2 by a curve labeled "p = p2".  
- Point 4 connected to point 3 by a curve labeled "p' = p4".  
- Point 5 connected to point 4 by a vertical line labeled "p = p0".  
- Point 6 connected to point 5 by a curve labeled "p = p0".
