x2 equals 1, xC equals 0, TK equals Ti minus 6 Kelvin, Ti equals 10 Kelvin under sublimation speed.  
Ti at 5 mbar equals -1 degrees Celsius.  
Tisob at 5 mbar equals -1 degrees Celsius.  
Ti equals 9 degrees Celsius equals 282.15 Kelvin.  

Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled with axes:  
   - The vertical axis is labeled "p [mbar]".  
   - The horizontal axis is labeled "T [°C]".  
   - The diagram shows phase regions labeled "flüssig" (liquid), "fest" (solid), and "gas" (gas).  
   - The triple point is marked at 0°C.  
   - A dashed line is drawn at 5 mbar, indicating the sublimation pressure.  

2. The second diagram is similar, with the same axes labeled "p [mbar]" and "T [°C]".  
   - It also shows the phase regions "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gas" (gas).  
   - The triple point is marked at 0°C.  
   - A dashed line is drawn at 5 mbar, indicating the sublimation pressure.
