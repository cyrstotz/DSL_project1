A diagram is drawn with temperature (T) on the x-axis and entropy (s) on the y-axis. The process is labeled with points 1 through 6, showing the following transitions:  
- From point 1 to point 2: "adiabatic, s = const"  
- From point 2 to point 3: "isentropic p2 → p3"  
- From point 3 to point 4: "isobaric p3"  
- From point 4 to point 5: "isentropic p5 → p6"  
- From point 5 to point 6: "adiabatic, s = const"  
The diagram also includes arrows indicating the return path and various process lines.
