The equation for heat transfer in the cooling cycle is written:  
Q dot K equals m dot times (h e minus h a).  

Rewritten:  
Q dot K equals m dot times (h 2 minus h 1).  

Further calculations and notes:  
- h 1 and h 2 are referenced.  
- Transition from state '2 to 3' is described with entropy constant:  
s 2 equals s 3.  
s j (8 bar).  

Work done by the compressor:  
W K equals 28 W.  

Mass flow rate equation:  
m dot times (h 2 minus h 3) equals 28 W.
