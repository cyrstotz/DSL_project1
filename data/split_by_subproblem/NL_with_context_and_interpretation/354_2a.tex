The diagram is a T-s (temperature-entropy) graph. It shows the process qualitatively with labeled isobars \( P_0 = P_6 \), \( P_1 \), \( P_3 \), and points marked as \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). The curve starts at \( 0 \), rises to \( 1 \), continues to \( 2 \), peaks at \( 3 \), descends to \( 4 \), and ends at \( 6 \).
