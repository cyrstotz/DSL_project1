A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "S [kJ/kg]" (entropy in kilojoules per kilogram).  

The diagram shows a curve representing a thermodynamic process.  
- The curve starts at a lower point, rises to a peak, and then descends.  
- A straight line labeled "isoline" intersects the descending part of the curve.  
- Points on the curve are marked, but no specific values are provided.
