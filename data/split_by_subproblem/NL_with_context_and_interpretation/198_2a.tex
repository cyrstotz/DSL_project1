A temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and processes.  
- The diagram includes points labeled 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The processes between these points are labeled as follows:  
  - Between 0 and 2: "isentrop"  
  - Between 2 and 3: "isobar"  
  - Between 3 and 4: "isobar"  
  - Between 4 and 5: "isobar"  
  - Between 5 and 6: "isentrop"  
- The isobars are labeled with pressures:  
  - \( p_0 = p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - \( p_2 = p_3 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)
