Entropy balance:  
Change in entropy equals mass at state 2 multiplied by specific entropy at state 2 minus mass at state 1 multiplied by specific entropy at state 1.  

Summation of changes in mass multiplied by specific entropy plus summation of heat flow divided by temperature plus entropy production.
