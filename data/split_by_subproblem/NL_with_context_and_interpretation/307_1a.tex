Energy balance:  
Zero equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy in minus enthalpy out) plus heat flow out plus work flow.  

Heat flow out equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy out minus enthalpy in), which equals mass flow rate times the integral from inlet temperature to outlet temperature of specific heat times dT plus zero (velocity term is crossed out).  

This simplifies to mass flow rate times specific heat times (outlet temperature minus inlet temperature).
