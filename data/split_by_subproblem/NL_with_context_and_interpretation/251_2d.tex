Zero equals Delta exergy of the stream plus summation of (1 minus T sub c divided by T sub i) multiplied by Q dot minus W dot in minus e sub x, vol.  

Negative e sub x, vol equals Delta exergy of the stream minus W dot in.  

Exergy vol equals T sub 0 multiplied by S dot erz equals T sub 0 multiplied by (s sub a minus s sub e) equals T sub 0 multiplied by (s sub 6 minus s sub a).  

This equals:  
T sub 0 multiplied by (cp multiplied by ln(T sub 0 divided by T sub 5) minus R multiplied by ln(p sub 0 divided by p sub c)).  

This equals:  
15421.75 joules per kilogram equals 15.622 kilojoules per kilogram.
