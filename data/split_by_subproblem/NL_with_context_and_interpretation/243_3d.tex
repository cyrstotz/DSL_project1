Ex total equals Ex ice plus Ex EW.  

Ex Q equals open parenthesis one minus T zero divided by T close parenthesis multiplied by Q.  

m EW equals first line.  

m in equals m total minus m EW equals m ice equals 5.925 kilograms.  

m in multiplied by open parenthesis one plus 5.925 close parenthesis equals m total.  

m in equals m ice divided by 6.925.

\( x_{12} = \frac{U_{final}}{U_{initial} + U_{heat}} = \frac{-33.462}{-33.462 + 0.003} = 0.999 \)  

\( K \cdot R \cdot T_{g} = T_{final} = 0.0005 \, \text{C} \)
