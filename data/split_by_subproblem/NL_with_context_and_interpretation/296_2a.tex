A diagram is drawn with the x-axis labeled as entropy (S) and the y-axis labeled as temperature (T [K]). The diagram represents a T-s plot with several labeled points and processes:  
- Point 1: Adiabatic nozzle.  
- Point 2: Adiabatic, reversible process.  
- Point 3: Adiabatic, reversible process.  
- Point 5: Isobaric process at 0.5 bar.  
- Point 6: Adiabatic, reversible process.  
- Arrows indicate the flow direction between points.  
- The mantle flow (\( \dot{m}_M \)) and core flow (\( \dot{m}_K \)) are labeled.  
- A note references \( \dot{Q}_R \).
