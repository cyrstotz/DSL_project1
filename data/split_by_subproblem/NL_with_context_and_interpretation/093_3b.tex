p2 = p1 (No pressure change because the pressure from the weight and piston remains constant.)  

Interpolation of temperature from table:  
T (1.4 bar) = T (1.4 bar) minus (T (2 bar) minus T (1.4 bar)) divided by (2 minus 1.4 bar)  
= -0.012 degrees Celsius (Temperature must remain constant because of the phase transition of ice to water.)
