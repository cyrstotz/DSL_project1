A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph shows a qualitative T-s diagram with labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the origin.  
- Point 2 higher up on the graph.  
- Point 3 further up and to the right.  
- Point 4 slightly lower and to the right of point 3.  
- Point 5 lower and to the left of point 4.  
- Point 6 slightly higher and to the left of point 5.  
- Point 7 lower and to the left of point 6, closer to point 0.
