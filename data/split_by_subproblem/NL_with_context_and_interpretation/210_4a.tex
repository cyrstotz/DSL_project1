Three diagrams are drawn, each representing pressure (P) versus temperature (T) relationships for different phases of R134a refrigerant.

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled as P (pressure) in unspecified units and T (temperature) in Kelvin.  
   - Three regions are marked:  
     - "fest" (solid phase)  
     - "flüssig" (liquid phase)  
     - "gas" (gas phase)  
   - A line labeled "Tripel" (triple point) separates the solid, liquid, and gas regions.  

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled as P (pressure) in bar and T (temperature) in Kelvin.  
   - Three regions are marked:  
     - "fest" (solid phase)  
     - "flüssig" (liquid phase)  
     - "gasförmig" (gaseous phase)  
   - Two steps are indicated:  
     - Step "i" shows movement from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase.  
     - Step "ii" shows movement from the solid phase to the liquid phase.  
   - The triple point is labeled "Tripel," and two points are marked as "0" and "z."  

3. **Third Diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled as P (pressure) in bar and T (temperature) in Kelvin.  
   - The diagram includes intersecting curves and lines representing phase boundaries.  
   - No specific labels are provided for the regions, but the lines suggest transitions between phases.
