A graph is drawn with pressure labeled as "P [bar]" on the vertical axis and temperature labeled as "T [K]" on the horizontal axis. The graph consists of four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, connected by lines forming a cycle.  

- Point 1 to Point 2: A horizontal line indicating constant pressure.  
- Point 2 to Point 3: A downward sloping line indicating a decrease in pressure and temperature.  
- Point 3 to Point 4: A horizontal line indicating constant pressure.  
- Point 4 to Point 1: An upward sloping line indicating an increase in pressure and temperature.  

Arrows are drawn along the lines to indicate the direction of the process.
