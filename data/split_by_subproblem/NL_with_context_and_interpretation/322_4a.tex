The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram. It shows phase regions labeled as "Gas," "Fl√ºssig" (Liquid), and "Fest" (Solid). The curve represents the phase boundaries, including the triple point. The x-axis is labeled as temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (K), and the y-axis is labeled as pressure \( p \).  

The second diagram is another pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram. It includes a dome-shaped curve labeled "Mischung" (Mixture) with points marked as "1" and "2." The triple point is indicated at the peak of the curve. The x-axis is labeled as temperature \( T \), and the y-axis is labeled as pressure \( p \).
