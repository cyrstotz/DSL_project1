A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points representing the jet engine process. The x-axis is labeled as 'S [kJ/kg·K]' and the y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'. The diagram shows the following points:  
- Point 0: Initial state  
- Point 1: Pre-compressor  
- Point 2: High-pressure compressor  
- Point 3: Combustion chamber  
- Point 4: Turbine  
- Point 5: Mixing chamber  
- Point 6: Nozzle  

The process is depicted with curves and straight lines connecting the points, indicating changes in temperature and entropy during the jet engine operation.  

Below the diagram, the following text is written:  
"Bei 1 teilt sich die Luft auf mk durchläuft den Turbinenprozess während mm direkt weiter zur Mischkammer geführt wird."  
Translation: "At point 1, the air splits; mk passes through the turbine process while mm is directly guided to the mixing chamber."
