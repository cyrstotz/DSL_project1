The pressure remains constant \( p_{1,3} = p_{2,s} \), as the temperature changes, but simultaneously the volume also changes, since the mass presses downward.  

\(\Delta U = \dot{m} \cdot Q_{12}\) (First Law of Thermodynamics)  

\(Q_{12} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)\)  

\(Q_{12} = 3.6 \, \text{kg} \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)\)
