In state 2, which is the final state, the ice-water mixture and the gas must have the same temperature:  
\( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

This ensures that no more heat is transferred and the system remains constant.  

The pressure \( p_2 \) remains equal to \( p_{amb} \), as the external conditions do not change.
