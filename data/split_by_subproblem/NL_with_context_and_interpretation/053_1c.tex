Q equals Q-out divided by T-reactor minus Q-out divided by T-bar.  
S-dot equals entropy balance equation used.  

S-dot equals Q-out divided by T-bar minus Q-out divided by T-reactor.  
S-dot equals 654 watts divided by 285 Kelvin minus 654 watts divided by 373.15 Kelvin equals 0.04615 watts per Kelvin.
