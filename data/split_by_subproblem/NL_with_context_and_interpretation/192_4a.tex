Two diagrams are drawn:

1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The vertical axis is labeled as 'p' (pressure).  
   - The horizontal axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
   - A triangular region is depicted, with lines intersecting to form phase boundaries.  
   - A curved line within the triangle is labeled 'NO'.  
   - The diagram appears to represent phase regions, possibly for the freeze-drying process.

2. The second diagram is another pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The vertical axis is labeled as 'p' (pressure).  
   - The horizontal axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
   - A point on the horizontal axis is marked as 'Ti'.  
   - The graph is simpler, showing a single horizontal line extending from 'Ti'.
