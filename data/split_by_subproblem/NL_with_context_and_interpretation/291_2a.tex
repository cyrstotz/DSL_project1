A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and processes. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T [K]" for temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" for entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.  

The diagram includes the following labeled points and processes:  
- Point 1: "wLuft"  
- Point 2: "adiabat rev"  
- Point 3: "isobar"  
- Point 5: "P5 = Pk = p1"  
- Point 6: "adiabat rev isentrop"  

Additional annotations:  
- "Mischkammer isobar" is written near the isobaric mixing chamber.  
- "P6 = p0" is labeled at the end of the process.
