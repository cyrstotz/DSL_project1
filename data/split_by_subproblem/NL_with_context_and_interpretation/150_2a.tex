A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]'.  

The diagram includes the following points and processes:  
- Point 0 leading to point 1 via an isobaric process.  
- Point 1 leading to point 2 via an isentropic process.  
- Point 2 leading to point 3 via an isobaric process.  
- Point 3 leading to point 4 via an isentropic process.  
- Point 4 leading to point 5 via an isobaric process.  
- Point 5 leading back to point 0 via an isentropic process.
