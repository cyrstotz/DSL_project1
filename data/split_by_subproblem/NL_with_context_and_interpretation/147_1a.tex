a) Steady-state flow process:  
Zero equals mass flow rate of coolant multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at inlet, plus velocity squared divided by two, plus gravitational acceleration multiplied by the height difference, equals heat flow transferred to the coolant.  

Zero equals mass flow rate of coolant multiplied by (enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at inlet plus velocity squared divided by two plus gravitational acceleration multiplied by height difference), equals heat flow transferred to the coolant.  

Steady-state reactor:  
Zero equals mass flow rate at inlet multiplied by (enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at inlet plus velocity squared divided by two plus gravitational acceleration multiplied by height difference), plus heat flow transferred to the coolant plus reaction heat.  

Enthalpy at exit equals enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius from water tables (A-2), equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.  
Enthalpy at inlet equals enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius from water tables (A-2), equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Heat flow transferred equals mass flow rate at inlet multiplied by (enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at inlet) plus reaction heat.  
Heat flow transferred equals 0.3 kilograms per second multiplied by (292.98 kilojoules per kilogram minus 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram) plus 100 kilowatts.  
Heat flow transferred equals 62.182 kilowatts.
