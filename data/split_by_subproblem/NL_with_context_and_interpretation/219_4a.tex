The page contains two diagrams:  

1. **First Diagram (p-T Diagram)**:  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature), and the y-axis is labeled as "p" (pressure).  
   - The diagram shows phase regions with labeled boundaries:  
     - "unterk端hlte Fl端ssigkeit" (subcooled liquid) on the left.  
     - "端berhitzter Dampf" (superheated vapor) on the right.  
     - "NQ-Gebiet (Nassdampf)" (wet steam region) in the middle.  
   - A "Triplepunkt" (triple point) is marked where the phase boundaries intersect.  

2. **Second Diagram (p-T Diagram)**:  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature), and the y-axis is labeled as "p" (pressure).  
   - The diagram shows three distinct regions:  
     - "Fest" (solid) on the left.  
     - "Fl端ssig" (liquid) in the middle.  
     - "Gas" (gas) on the right.  
   - A "Triplepunkt" (triple point) is marked where the solid, liquid, and gas regions meet.
