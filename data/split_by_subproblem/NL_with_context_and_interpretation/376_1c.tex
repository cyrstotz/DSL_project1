Entropy due to heat flow (mass of heat = 0):  

Negative heat flow divided by thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant plus positive heat flow divided by thermodynamic mean temperature of the reactor plus entropy production equals zero:  
- \( \dot{Q}_{out} / T_{KF} + \dot{Q}_{out} / T_{W} + \dot{S}_{erz} = 0 \)  

Rearranging:  
\( \dot{Q}_{out} / T_{KF} - \dot{Q}_{out} / T_{W} = \dot{S}_{erz} \)  

Thermodynamic mean temperature of the reactor:  
\( T_{W} = 100^\circ C = 393.15 \, \text{K} \)  

Entropy production:  
\( \dot{S}_{erz} = 0.095 \, \text{kW/K} = 95.5 \, \text{J/K} \)
