Energy balance for the jet engine (system boundary: entire engine):  
The equation is written as:  
dE/dt = m dot (h0 minus h6 plus w Luft squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2) plus summation of Q dot i minus summation of W dot i.  

Further derivations:  
- w6 squared equals 2 h0 minus 2 h6 plus w Luft squared.  
- h0 minus h6 equals Cp integral of dT from T0 to T6.  

To determine T6:  
T6 equals T5 multiplied by (P0 divided by P5) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4).  

Calculation:  
T6 equals 431.5 Kelvin multiplied by (0.191 divided by 0.15) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4), resulting in T6 = 328.08747 Kelvin.  

Further calculation:  
h0 minus h6 equals Cp multiplied by (743.15 Kelvin minus 328.08747 Kelvin), which equals minus 85.134 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Final derivation:  
w6 equals the square root of 2 multiplied by (minus 85.134) plus 200 meters per second squared.
