Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a T-s (temperature-entropy) diagram.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 's' (entropy), and the y-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
   - Several isobaric lines are shown, including one labeled '0.191 bar'.  
   - A process path is drawn, starting at point '0', moving to point '1', and then to point '2'.  
   - The path includes an isochoric segment labeled 'isochor'.  

2. The second diagram is a T-s diagram with additional details.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 's' (entropy), and the y-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
   - Several isobaric lines are shown, including one labeled '0.019 bar'.  
   - A process path is drawn, starting at point '0', moving to '1', then '2k', '3k', and finally '5'.  
   - The path includes segments labeled 'isochor' and 'isobar'.
