A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn with labeled axes: pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis.  
- The diagram includes regions labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point), "Gas," "Fest" (solid), and "Isobar."  
- An isothermal line is marked as "10K Ã¼ber Sublimationspunkt" (10K above sublimation point).  
- Another line is labeled "10K unter Tripelpunkt" (10K below triple point).  
- The phase regions are shaded, and points are marked to indicate transitions between phases.
