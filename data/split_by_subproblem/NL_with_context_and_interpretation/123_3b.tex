\( T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} = 500^\circ \text{C} \)  
The process is adiabatic; therefore, the polytropic relationship \( pV^n = \text{constant} \) applies.  
From the ideal gas equation \( pV = mRT \), it follows that if \( pV^n \) is constant, the process must also be isothermal.  

Thus, \( T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} = 500^\circ \text{C} \).  

\( pV^n = mRT \)  
\( p_2 = \frac{mRT}{V^n} = \frac{3.1422 \times 10^{-3} \times 166.28}{3.14 \times 10^{-3}} \)  
\( p_2 = 166.28 \, \text{bar} \).
