The pressure remains constant because the external pressure and mass of EW/piston remain equal:  
\( p_2 = 1.40094 \, \text{bar} \).  

Mass of the gas, pressure, and gas constant remain the same, but volume changes, so temperature also changes.  

At \( x_{\text{Ice},2} > 0 \), the temperature of EW = 0Â°C, and the gas temperature \( T_{g,2} = 0 \).
