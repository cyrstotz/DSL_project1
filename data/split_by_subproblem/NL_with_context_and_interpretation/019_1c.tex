Entropy production S dot erz:  
S dot erz equals m dot multiplied by (s2 minus s1) plus Q dot R divided by 100 degrees Celsius.  

S dot erz equals m dot multiplied by (0) plus Q dot R divided by 100 degrees Celsius.  

Result:  
S dot erz equals negative 0.268 kilowatts per Kelvin.  

Since the calculation was done for water, adjustments must be made.  

Final result:  
S dot erz equals 0.268 kilowatts per Kelvin.
