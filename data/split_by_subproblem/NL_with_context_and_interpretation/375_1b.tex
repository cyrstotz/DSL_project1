Thermodynamic mean temperature \( T \) equals the integral from \( s_a \) to \( s_e \) of temperature \( T \) with respect to entropy \( ds \).  

\( s_2 - s_1 \) equals the integral from \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \) of specific heat \( c \) divided by temperature \( T \) with respect to temperature \( dt \).  
This simplifies to \( c \) multiplied by the natural logarithm of \( T_2 \) divided by \( T_1 \).
