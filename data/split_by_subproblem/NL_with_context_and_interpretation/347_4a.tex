A graph is drawn with pressure (p [bar]) on the y-axis and temperature (T [°C]) on the x-axis. The graph shows a curve labeled with different regions:  
- The left side is labeled "Flüssigkeit" (liquid).  
- The middle region is labeled "1" and "2" with "Nassdampf" (wet steam).  
- The right side is labeled "Dampf" (steam).  
- The curve peaks at the top and transitions between the labeled regions.  
- \( T_i \) is marked on the x-axis.
