A graph is drawn with pressure (p) labeled on the vertical axis in bar and temperature (T) labeled on the horizontal axis in Kelvin. The graph shows a curve with three labeled regions:  
- "Huis" (on the left side of the curve)  
- "Triple point" (at the peak of the curve)  
- "Dampf" (on the right side of the curve)
