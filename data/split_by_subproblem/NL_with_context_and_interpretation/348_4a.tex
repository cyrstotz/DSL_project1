A diagram is drawn showing phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gasförmig" (gaseous). The diagram includes a line labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point) and an arrow pointing to "Ti" (interior temperature). The x-axis is labeled "Tin in °C" (temperature in degrees Celsius), and the y-axis is labeled "p in bar" (pressure in bar).
