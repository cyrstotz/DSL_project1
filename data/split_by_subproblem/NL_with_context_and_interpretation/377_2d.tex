Exergy loss equals delta exergy minus exergy at state R.  

Exergy loss equals summation of exergy at state 6 plus summation of exergy at state R minus summation of work minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals delta exergy plus (1 minus temperature at state 0 divided by temperature at state B) times heat at state B minus work minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals delta exergy plus (1 minus temperature at state 0 divided by temperature at state B) times heat at state B.  

Exergy loss equals 37,531 kilojoules per kilogram plus (1 minus temperature at state 0 divided by temperature at state B) times heat at state B.  

Exergy loss equals 37,531 kilojoules per kilogram plus (1 minus temperature at state 0 divided by temperature at state B) times heat at state B.  

Exergy loss equals 37,531 kilojoules per kilogram plus (1 minus temperature at state 0 divided by temperature at state B) times heat at state B.  

Exergy loss equals 37,531 kilojoules per kilogram plus (1 minus temperature at state 0 divided by temperature at state B) times heat at state B.  

Exergy loss equals 1,067.17 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Temperature at state 0 equals 243.15 Kelvin.  
Temperature at state B equals 1289 Kelvin.  
Heat at state B equals 1195 kilojoules per kilogram.
