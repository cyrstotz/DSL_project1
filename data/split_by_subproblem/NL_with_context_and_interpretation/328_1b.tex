Thermodynamic mean temperature:  

T tilde equals integral of T dS divided by S_a minus S_e.  

T tilde equals c_w times ln(T_a divided by T_e) divided by c_w times ln(T_a divided by T_e).  

c_w times ln(T_a divided by T_e) equals c_w times (T_a minus T_e) plus v times (p2 divided by p1).  

S_a minus S_e equals c_w times ln(T_a divided by T_e).  

T tilde equals 10 divided by ln(292.15 divided by 288.15).  

T tilde approximately equals 293.121 Kelvin.
