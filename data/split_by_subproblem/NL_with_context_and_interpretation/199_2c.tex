The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as:  
\( R = c_{p,\text{Luft}} - c_{v,\text{Luft}} \)  
Substituting:  
\( R = \frac{c_{p,\text{Luft}}}{n} \cdot (n - 1) \)  
\( R = \frac{1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}}{1.4} \cdot (1.4 - 1) \)  
Result: \( R = 0.72285 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \).

Exergy equation:  
exergy at state 6 minus exergy at state 0 equals delta exergy.  

Delta exergy equals h subscript c minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript c minus s subscript 0) plus delta kinetic energy.  

Delta exergy equals c subscript p multiplied by (T subscript 0 minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript 0 multiplied by c subscript p divided by R multiplied by ln of (p subscript 0 divided by p subscript c) minus w subscript 2 squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy equals mass multiplied by (1.006 multiplied by (320.8 minus 293.15 minus 293.15 multiplied by ln of (320.8 divided by 293.15)) minus 222.88 plus ln of (p subscript 1 divided by p subscript 0)).  

Delta exergy equals 502.28 minus 20.09 equals 120.8 kilojoules per kilogram.
