Delta exergy (exergy_str) equals exergy_str,6 minus exergy_str,0.  

exergy_str,0 equals:  
h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0) plus w_6 squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy equals:  
c_p multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 multiplied by c_p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0) plus w_6 squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2.  

T_6 equals 431.9 K, w_6 equals 220 meters per second.  

Result: 110065.46 joules per kilogram equals 110 kilojoules per kilogram.
