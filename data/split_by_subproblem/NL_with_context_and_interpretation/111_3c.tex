(*) State 2 is a thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e., T_g2 = T_EW,2.  
x_ice,2 > 0 and x_ice,2 ≠ 1 must hold.  
T_EW,2 equals T_EW,1, i.e., T_g2 = 0°C.

Consider the energy balance around the gas:  
Closed system implies that the change in energy (ΔE) equals the heat transfer (Q12) minus the work done (Wv).  

For an isobaric process:  
Pressure of gas (pg) equals initial pressure (pg1).  
Work done (Wv) equals the integral of pressure times the change in volume (∫pdV), which simplifies to:  
Wv = pg1(V2 - V1).  

For an ideal gas:  
pg1V1/Tg1 = pg1V2/Tg2.  
Thus, V2 = V1(Tg2/Tg1).  

Substituting values:  
V2 = 3.14 × (273.153 / 773.15) × 10^-3 = 1.10936 × 10^-3 m^3.  

Calculating work done (Wv):  
Wv = 1.5 × 10^5 × (1.10936 - 3.14 × 10^-3) = -3.04596 × 10^2 J.  

Change in energy (ΔE):  
ΔE = mg × cv × (Tg2 - Tg1).  

For an ideal gas:  
Q12 = ΔE + Wv = 3.6 × 10^-3 × 0.633 × (273.153 - 773.15) - (-3.04596 × 10^2).  
Q12 = -1443.99 J.
