A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn with labeled regions and points:  
- The y-axis is labeled as "p [mBAR]" and the x-axis as "T [°C]".  
- The diagram includes three phase regions: "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas).  
- The sublimation point is marked, and the triple point is labeled as "Tripel".  
- Two steps are indicated:  
  - Step I shows a vertical line at constant pressure.  
  - Step II shows a horizontal line at constant temperature, labeled "10K".  
- The pressure inside the freeze dryer is marked as "5 mBAR".
