A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled phase regions. The diagram includes the following:  
- A curve labeled "Nass-Dampf" (wet vapor).  
- Four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- Two isobaric processes labeled "isobar."  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The y-axis is labeled as "[bar]" (pressure in bar).
