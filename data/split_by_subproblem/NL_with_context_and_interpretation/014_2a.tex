A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points:  
- \( T \) [°C] on the vertical axis and \( s \) [kJ/kg·K] on the horizontal axis.  
- Points 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curve.  
- \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) is labeled near point 5.  
- \( p_0 \) is labeled near point 0.  
- Dashed lines represent isobars for \( p_0 \) and \( p_5 \).
