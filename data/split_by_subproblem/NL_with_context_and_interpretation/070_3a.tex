R equals R bar divided by M equals 83.49 divided by 50 equals 166.98 joules per kilogram Kelvin.  

P_EW equals P_0 plus F divided by A equals 1 bar plus m times g times (pi divided by 2) squared equals 7.297 bar.  

P_g,1 equals P_g equals P_EW equals 7.297 bar.  

V_1 equals 3.19 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.  
T_1 equals 773.15 Kelvin.  

m_g equals P_g times V_1 divided by R times T_1 equals 0.03126 kilograms.
