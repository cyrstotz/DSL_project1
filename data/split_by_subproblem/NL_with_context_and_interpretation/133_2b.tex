A graph is drawn labeled `a)` with axes \( T \, (\text{K}) \) and \( S \, (\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}) \). The graph shows a qualitative T-s diagram with labeled points:  
- 0 (start),  
- 1 (compression),  
- 2 (mixing),  
- 3 (heat addition),  
- 4 (expansion),  
- 5 (exit).  
The curve includes isobars and transitions between processes.
