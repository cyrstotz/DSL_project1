Coefficient of performance (COP) equals Q2 divided by W2, which equals Q1 divided by W1.  

First law of thermodynamics: Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by (h1 minus h2) plus QK.  
QK equals mass flow rate multiplied by (h2 minus h1).  

h2 equals 234.08 kilojoules per kilogram (refer to Table A-10).  
Mass flow rate equals four kilograms per hour divided by sixty minutes per hour divided by sixty seconds per minute multiplied by (234.08 minus 93.42) kilojoules per kilogram equals 156.3 watts.  

COP equals 156.3 watts divided by 28 watts equals 5.582.
