A diagram is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (p-T) relationship. The graph includes labeled regions:  
- "fest" (solid)  
- "flüssig" (liquid)  
- "gasförmig" (gaseous)  
The triple point ("Tripel") is marked, and two steps are indicated:  
- Step (i)  
- Step (ii)  

The x-axis is labeled as temperature \( T \) in Kelvin (\( K \)), and the y-axis is labeled as pressure \( p \) in bar (\( \text{bar} \)).
