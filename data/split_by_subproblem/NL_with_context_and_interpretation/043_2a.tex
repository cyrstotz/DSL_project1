**T-s Diagram**  
A diagram is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 'S [kJ/kgÂ·K]' and the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]'.  
The diagram includes the following labeled points and processes:  
- Point 1: Isobar  
- Point 2: Isobar  
- Point 3: Adiabatic  
- Point 4: Isobar  
- Point 5: Mixing chamber labeled as 'MM'  
- Point 6: Isobar  
The pressure difference is indicated as \( p_3 = p_1 \).
