Steady flow process:  
O equals m dot multiplied by (h5 minus h6 plus w6 squared divided by 2 minus w5 squared divided by 2) plus Q minus W.  
O equals m dot CES multiplied by (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2).  
h5 minus h6 equals (T5 minus T6) multiplied by cp.  

T6 equals T5 multiplied by (p0 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  
T6 equals 328.07 K.  

m dot CES equals m dot K plus m dot M.  
m dot M equals 51.253 multiplied by m dot K.  

T1 equals T0 multiplied by (p1 divided by p0) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  
T1 equals 320.059 K.  

O equals m dot CES multiplied by (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2).  

Ansatz:  
O equals m dot CES multiplied by h5 minus m dot CES multiplied by h6 plus w5 squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2 equals w6 squared divided by 2.  

w6 squared equals 2 multiplied by (h5 minus h6) plus w5 squared.  
w6 equals square root of (2 multiplied by (h5 minus h6) plus w5 squared).  
w6 equals square root of (2 multiplied by cp multiplied by (T5 minus T6) plus w5 squared).  
w6 equals 220.474 meters per second.
