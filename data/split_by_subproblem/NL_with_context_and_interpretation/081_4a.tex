A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis.  

The graph includes three labeled points:  
- Point 1 is at the lower left.  
- Point 2 is slightly above and to the right of Point 1, connected by a curve.  
- Point 3 is further up and to the right, connected to Point 2 by another curve.  

The curves represent transitions between states in the freeze-drying process.
