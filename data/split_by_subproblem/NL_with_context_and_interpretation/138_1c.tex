Next, the entropy production is determined using the entropy balance:  

S dot equals m dot in times s in minus m dot out times s out plus Q dot out divided by T plus S dot erz equals zero (steady state).  

Thus:  
Q dot out divided by T plus m dot in times (s KF in minus s KF out) equals minus S dot erz.
