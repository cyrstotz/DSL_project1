A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [Â°C]) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes phase regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "gas."  
- Point 1 is marked in the liquid region.  
- Point 2 is marked in the solid region.  
- Point 3 is marked in the gas region.  
- An isothermal line connects points 2 and 3.  
- An isobaric line connects points 1 and 2.  
- The phase transition between solid and liquid is indicated.

In state 2: saturated vapor  

T4 equals T1 equals 31.33 degrees Celsius equals T3
