A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the y-axis labeled in "Pa" and temperature (T) on the x-axis. The graph shows a phase diagram with labeled regions and points:  
- "1" is in the liquid phase.  
- "2" is labeled "isobar" and transitions into the gas phase.  
- "3" is labeled "gas".  
- "4" is labeled "Tc r134" at the peak of the curve.  
- The curve transitions through "Non-Dampf" (non-vapor) and "isobar" regions.  
- Two arrows at the bottom indicate "Back" and "Exit".
