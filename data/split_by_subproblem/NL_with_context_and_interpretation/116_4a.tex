A diagram is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled curves and lines:  
- An "isobar" line at 8 bar.  
- Another "isobar" line at a lower pressure.  
- An "isenthalp" line connecting points 4 and 3.  
- An "isentrop" line connecting points 2 and 3.  
- Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked on the diagram.
