Delta exergy of the stream equals:  
(h sub 6 minus h sub a) minus T sub 0 multiplied by (s sub 6 minus s sub a) plus Delta e sub k.  

This equals:  
(h sub 6 minus h sub 0) minus T sub 0 multiplied by (s sub 6 minus s sub 0) plus Delta e sub k.  

With values from tables:  
This equals:  
(cp multiplied by (T sub 6 minus T sub 0)) minus T sub 0 multiplied by cp multiplied by ln(T sub 6 divided by T sub 0) minus R multiplied by ln(p sub 6 divided by p sub 0) plus (w sub 6 squared divided by 2 minus w sub 0 squared divided by 2).  

This equals:  
125497.75 joules per kilogram minus 125.47 kilojoules per kilogram.
