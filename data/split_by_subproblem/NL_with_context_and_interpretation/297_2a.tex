A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and process steps. The diagram includes the following:  
- Axes labeled as "T [K]" for temperature and "s [kJ/kgK]" for entropy.  
- Isobars (ideal gas) are shown as curved lines.  
- Process steps are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Arrows indicate the direction of the processes.  
- Labels include:  
  - "Isobaric reversible"  
  - "Adiabatic reversible"  
  - "Adiabatic irreversible â†’ isentropic"  
  - "Adiabatic expansion"
