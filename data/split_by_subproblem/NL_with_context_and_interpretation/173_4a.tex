A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) in bar on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) in Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a dome-shaped curve labeled with points 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left of the curve.  
- Point 2 is at the bottom right of the curve.  
- Point 3 is at the top of the curve.  
- Point 4 is on the left side of the curve, near the peak.  

The pressure at point 1 is labeled as \( p_1 = 1 \, \text{bar} \), and the temperature is labeled as \( T_1 = -10^\circ \text{C} \).
