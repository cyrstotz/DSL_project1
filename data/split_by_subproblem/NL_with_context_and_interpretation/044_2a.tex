A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states. The diagram includes the following:  
- States labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Isobars are shown as curved lines connecting the states.  
- \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) is noted.  
- \( p_2 \), \( p_3 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_5 \) are marked along the isobars.  
- The x-axis is labeled as \( S \) (entropy), and the y-axis is labeled as \( T \) (temperature).  
- Additional notes: "Mantle stream, core stream, thermodynamic mean temperature."
