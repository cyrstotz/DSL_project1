T-s diagram: Rocket side!  
[Two diagrams are drawn. The first diagram shows a series of loops with labeled axes "T" (temperature) and "s" (entropy). The second diagram includes intersecting lines and arrows, also labeled with "T" and "s".]

\( \Delta ex_{str} = 1.006 \cdot (328.15 - 243.15) - \frac{243.15}{328.15} \cdot (1.006 \cdot \ln(328.15 / 243.15)) + \frac{(400.55)^2}{2} \)  

\( \Delta ex_{str} = 80.23 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
\( \Delta ex_{str} = 80.2 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)
