Delta exergy equals exergy at state 6 minus exergy at state 0.  

Delta exergy equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus temperature at state 0 times (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0) plus velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2) minus mass flow rate times (enthalpy at state 0 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus temperature at state 0 times (entropy at state 0 minus entropy at state 0) plus velocity at state 0 squared divided by 2).  

Delta exergy equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus temperature at state 0 times (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0) plus velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2 minus velocity at state 0 squared divided by 2).  

Using substance properties:  
Enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 equals specific heat times (temperature at state 6 minus temperature at state 0).  
Entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0 equals specific heat times logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 0).  
Velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2 minus velocity at state 0 squared divided by 2 equals velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy equals specific heat times (temperature at state 6 minus temperature at state 0) minus temperature at state 0 times (specific heat times logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 0)) minus velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (temperature at state 6 minus temperature at state 0) minus 1.006 times 10 to the power of 3 joules per kilogram Kelvin times logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 0) minus velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy equals 37,551.573 joules per kilogram minus 37,551 kilojoules per kilogram minus 37,531 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy equals 37,531 kilojoules per kilogram.
