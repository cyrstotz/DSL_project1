Delta exergy stream equals h subscript a minus h subscript e minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript a minus s subscript e) plus (w subscript e squared minus w subscript 0 squared) divided by 2. This equals 232.33 joules per kilogram.  

T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript a minus s subscript e) equals c subscript p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p subscript c divided by p subscript 0). This equals 58.373 joules per kilogram.  

h subscript a minus h subscript e equals c subscript p multiplied by delta T. This equals 65.37 joules per kilogram.  

w subscript 0 equals 200 meters per second.  

Delta kinetic energy equals 108.652 joules.  

It is calculated with 700 liters per kilogram.
