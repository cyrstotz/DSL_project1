A graph is drawn with temperature (T in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and entropy (S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts a qualitative T-S diagram for the jet engine process. The states are labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There are curved and straight lines connecting the states, with annotations indicating processes such as "p = const" (pressure constant).  

Below the graph, the following values are listed:  
- \( p \): 0.191  
- \( T \): -30
