A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled regions and transitions:  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'T (Â°C)' and the y-axis as 'p'.  
- The diagram includes phase regions marked as 'solid', 'liquid', and 'gas'.  
- A line labeled 'ii' represents the transition from solid to liquid.  
- A point labeled 'Triple' indicates the triple point of water.  
- A line labeled 'Ti' represents the temperature inside the freeze dryer.  
- A shaded region labeled 'FL (5 mbar)' indicates the sublimation process.  
- The note 'Wasser kann hier sublimieren' translates to 'Water can sublimate here'.
