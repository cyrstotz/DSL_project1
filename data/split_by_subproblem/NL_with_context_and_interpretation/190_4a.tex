A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [K]) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows a cycle with four states labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. Arrows indicate the direction of the cycle, starting at state 1, moving to state 2, then state 3, and finally state 4 before returning to state 1.
