Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. On the left, a rectangular cycle labeled "i" is shown on a graph with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis. The cycle is labeled with points 1, 2, 3, and 4, connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
2. On the right, a phase diagram labeled "ii" is shown with pressure \( p \) (in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) (in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes curves for different phase regions, and points labeled 1, 2, and 3 are marked along the curves.
