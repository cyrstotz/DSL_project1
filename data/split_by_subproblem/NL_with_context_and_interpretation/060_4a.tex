A p-T diagram is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled points: 1, 2, 3, and 4. There is a phase region shaded near point 1, indicating the vapor-liquid equilibrium. The points are connected in a cycle, representing the refrigeration process.
