Entropy production rate plus mass flow rate times (entropy outlet minus entropy inlet) plus sum of heat flow divided by temperature equals 0.  
Entropy production rate equals 0.  

Heat flow to coolant divided by temperature equals mass flow rate times (entropy outlet minus entropy inlet).  
Thermodynamic mean temperature equals c times (T2 minus T1) divided by ln(T2 divided by T1).  
Thermodynamic mean temperature equals 293.12 Kelvin.
