Graph description:  
A T-s diagram is drawn with temperature (T) in Kelvin on the x-axis and entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the y-axis.  

The diagram includes labeled isobars and process points:  
- Point 0 (ambient conditions)  
- Point 1 (pre-compressor inlet)  
- Point 2 (pre-compressor outlet)  
- Point 3 (high-pressure compressor outlet)  
- Point 4 (combustion chamber outlet)  
- Point 5 (mixing chamber outlet)  
- Point 6 (nozzle outlet)  

The processes are connected with arrows and include isobaric and adiabatic transitions.
