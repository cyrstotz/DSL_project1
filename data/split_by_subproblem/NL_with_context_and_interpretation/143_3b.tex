p sub g,2 equals p sub g,1 equals 1.4 bar, since the same pressure from the atmosphere and weight still acts.  

Polytropic process:  
R plus c sub V divided by c sub V equals k equals 1.263.  

T sub g,2 equals T sub g,1 times (p sub 2 divided by p sub 1) raised to the power of k minus 1 divided by k equals 773.75 kelvin.
