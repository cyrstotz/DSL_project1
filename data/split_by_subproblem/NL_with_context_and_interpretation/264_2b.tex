The first law of thermodynamics is written as:  
"1HS: hs - h6 = 0 = m [(w6 squared minus w5 squared) divided by 2] + g(z6 minus z5) + (q minus w)."  

Further derivations:  
- "m dot w6 squared divided by 2 hs = m dot w6 squared divided by 2 h6."  
- "w6 squared hs = 600 squared h6 => w6 hs divided by h6 = w6."  

Interpolation is performed using Table A-22:  
- hs = 431.43 minus 421.26.  
- (431.43 minus 430) + 421.26 = 49.421,43566.  
- hs = 421.44 kJ/kg.  

Additional notes:  
- "Was ist h6?" (What is h6?)  
- "Wir ben√∂tigen T6." (We need T6.)  

Equation for T6:  
T6 = Tc multiplied by (Pc divided by Ps) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

Constants:  
- n = kappa = Cp divided by Cv = 1.006 kJ/kgK divided by Cp minus R.  
- Specified: n = 1.4.

\( T_6 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \)  
\( \frac{191,100 \, \text{Pa}}{50,000 \, \text{Pa}} \)  
\( = 328.67469 \, \text{K} \)  
\( = 328.1 \, \text{K} \)  

Interpolation:  
\( h_6 = \frac{330.34 - 325.31}{328.1 - 325} \times (328.1 - 325.31) + 325.31 \)  
\( = 328.4031 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
\( = 328.40 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

\( w_0 = w_s = \sqrt{\frac{h_s}{k_hc}} \)  
\( = 220 \, \text{m/s} \)  
\( = \sqrt{\frac{328.4031}{421.48366}} \)  
\( = 194.2051 \, \text{m/s} \)  

\( w_6 = 194.2 \, \text{m/s} \)
