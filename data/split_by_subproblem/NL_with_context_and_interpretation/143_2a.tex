A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and process points. The diagram includes the following:  
- Points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( s_n = s_2 \), \( p_t = p_s = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_1 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( s_s = s_6 \).  
- A note labeled "mein Punkt" near point 3.  
- Axes labeled \( T \, (\text{K}) \) and \( s \, (\text{kJ/kgK}) \).  

Another smaller T-s diagram is drawn below, showing similar labeled points and isobars.  
- \( p_1 = p_4 = p_s \).  
- \( p_5/p_s/p_6/p_0 \).  
- Axes labeled \( T \, (\text{K}) \) and \( s \, (\text{kJ/kgK}) \).  
- A note labeled "nicht nullpunkt" near point 0.
