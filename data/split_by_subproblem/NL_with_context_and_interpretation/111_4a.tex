A graph is drawn with labeled axes. The vertical axis is labeled 'p' (pressure), and the horizontal axis is labeled 'T' (temperature). Three phase regions are indicated: 'Fest' (solid), 'Fl√ºssig' (liquid), and 'Gas' (gas). Two processes are marked:  
- Process 'i)' starts in the solid region and moves into the liquid region.  
- Process 'ii)' starts in the liquid region and transitions into the gas region.  
Points labeled '1', '2', and '3' are marked along the curve separating the phases.
