A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as 'p' (pressure) on the vertical axis and 'T' (temperature) on the horizontal axis. Four points are marked on the diagram: 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- Point 1 is at the lower left, near the saturated vapor region.  
- Point 2 is slightly higher and to the right.  
- Point 3 is at the top right, above the saturated vapor region.  
- Point 4 is to the left of point 3, near the saturated liquid region.  
The diagram includes curves labeled as:  
- "Q = 0" (heat transfer is zero) near the saturated vapor region.  
- "Nassdampfgebiet" (wet steam region) near the saturated liquid region.  
- "p = const" (pressure is constant) along the horizontal lines connecting points 2 and 3, and points 3 and 4.
