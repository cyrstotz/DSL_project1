h sub f (31.33) equals 94.4 plus x multiplied by (34.39 minus 94.43).  
h sub f equals 94.4235.  
g (31.33) equals Gleich equals 2.6 times 1.5.  

A graph is drawn with axes labeled as p and T.

A table is presented with the following columns:  
- **State (zust)**: 1, 2, 3, 4  
- **Pressure (P)**: Not specified  
- **Temperature (T)**: \( T_i = T_4 \)  
- **Vapor Quality (x)**:  
  - State 1: \( x = 1 \)  
  - State 2: \( x = 1 \)  
  - State 3: \( x = 0 \)  
  - State 4: \( x = 0 \)  

Next to the table, the following annotations are written:  
- **State 1**: "Isobaric evaporation, 6K"  
- **State 2**: "Adiabatic compression"  
- **State 3**: "Isobaric condensation"  
- **State 4**: "Adiabatic expansion (Drossel)"  

A sketch of a process diagram is drawn, showing transitions between states with arrows labeled as described above.
