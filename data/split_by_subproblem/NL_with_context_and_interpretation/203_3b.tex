Since the mass above the membrane remains constant, the pressure below must also remain constant:  
\( p_{g,1} = p_{g,2} = 1.401 \, \text{bar} \)  

First law applied to the cylinder:  
\( \Delta E = Q - W = \Delta U \)  

\( W_{EZ} = \int p_1 \, \text{d}V = p_1 (V_2 - V_1) = U_1 - U_2 = c_V (T_1 - T_2) \)
