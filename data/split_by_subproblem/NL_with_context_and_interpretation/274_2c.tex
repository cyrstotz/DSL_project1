m-dot S  
Delta ex_str equals c_p multiplied by (S_TG minus S_T0) minus ex_str_0.  
ex_str divided by m-dot equals [h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 multiplied by (S_6 minus S_0) plus w_6 squared divided by 2 minus w_0 squared divided by 2].  
Equals c_p multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 multiplied by [ln(T_6 divided by T_0) minus R multiplied by ln(p_0 divided by p_0)] plus w_6 squared divided by 2 minus w_0 squared divided by 2.  
Equals 110.488 kJ divided by kg.
