The equation for energy balance is written:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} + g(z_e - z_a) \right] + \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W} \).  

For states 5-6 (isentropic):  
\( 0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right] + 0 - 0 \).  
\( = \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \left[ h_5 - h_6 + \frac{220^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right] \).  

To find \( h_5 - h_6 \):  
Air is treated as ideal gas with \( c_{p,\text{Luft}} = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \).  
For states 5-6 (isentropic, \( n = \kappa = 1.4 \)):  
\( h(T_5) - h(T_6) = c_p \cdot (T_5 - T_6) \).  
\( = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \cdot (431.9 - T_6) \).

h6 minus h5 equals 220 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2.  
h6 minus h5 equals 200 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2.  

5 to 6 isentropic.  

T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k).  
T6 divided by T5 equals (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4).  
T6 divided by T5 equals 0.759608.  
T6 equals 0.759608 multiplied by 431.9K.  
T6 equals 328.0747K.  

Von(1):  
0 equals 1.006 multiplied by (431.9K minus 328.0747K) plus 220 squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2.  
w6 squared divided by 2 equals 24304.  
w6 equals square root of 48608.  
w6 equals 220.472 meters per second.
