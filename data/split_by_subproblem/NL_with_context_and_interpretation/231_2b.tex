The flow process is stationary:  
0 equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 5 plus velocity at state 6 squared minus velocity at state 5 squared divided by 2) plus the sum of heat flows minus the sum of work flows.  

Negative reaction heat divided by mass flow rate equals enthalpy at state 5 minus enthalpy at state 6 plus velocity at state 6 squared minus velocity at state 5 squared divided by 2.  

T5 equals 431.9 Kelvin.  
T6 is calculated as:  
T6 equals T5 multiplied by (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  
T6 equals 431.9 Kelvin multiplied by (0.191 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4).  
T6 equals 328.08 Kelvin.  

Enthalpy at state 5 is calculated as:  
h at state 5 equals h at 490 Kelvin plus (431.9 Kelvin minus 430 Kelvin) divided by (490 Kelvin minus 430 Kelvin) multiplied by (h at 490 Kelvin minus h at 430 Kelvin).  
h at state 5 equals 433.364 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Enthalpy at state 6 is calculated as:  
h at state 6 equals h at 330 Kelvin plus (328.08 Kelvin minus 325 Kelvin) divided by (330 Kelvin minus 325 Kelvin) multiplied by (h at 330 Kelvin minus h at 325 Kelvin).  
h at state 6 equals 328.38 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Velocity at state 6 squared equals velocity at state 5 squared plus (enthalpy at state 5 minus enthalpy at state 6) multiplied by 2 plus reaction heat divided by mass flow rate multiplied by 2.  

Mass flow rate equals ?.
