\( P_{g,2} = P_{g,1} \), as the weight of the piston and the weight of the ice-water mixture, as well as the surrounding pressure, do not change.  

\( T_{g,2} = \frac{0.1 \, \text{kg} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K} + 3.4217 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg} \cdot 773.15 \, \text{K}}{0.1 \, \text{kg} + 3.4217 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{kg}} = 289.694 \, \text{K} \)  

\( T_{g,2} = 16.54^\circ \text{C} \)
