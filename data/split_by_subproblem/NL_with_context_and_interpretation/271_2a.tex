A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \). The diagram shows the process states labeled as 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (entropy) on the horizontal axis. The process includes isobaric and adiabatic transitions, with arrows indicating the direction of the process flow.
