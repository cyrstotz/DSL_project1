A diagram is drawn with the temperature (T) in Kelvin on the vertical axis and entropy (s) in Joules per Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The diagram represents a T-s process for a jet engine. The process includes labeled points and curves:  
- Point 1: "isentropic"  
- Point 2: "adiabatic, irreversible"  
- Point 3: "isentropic"  
- Point 4: "adiabatic, irreversible"  
- Point 5: "isentropic"  
- Point 6: "turbine"
