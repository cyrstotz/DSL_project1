T KF bar equals integral of T d s divided by s a minus s e equals q rev divided by s a minus s e equals integral from T 1 to T 2 of c p divided by T d T plus v multiplied by (p 2 minus p 1).  

T KF bar equals c p multiplied by (T 2 minus T 1) divided by ln of T 2 divided by T 1 equals (T 2 minus T 1) divided by ln of T 2 divided by T 1.  

T KF bar equals 298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by ln of 288.15 divided by 298.15 equals 10 divided by ln of h water divided by h in equals 293.12 Kelvin.
