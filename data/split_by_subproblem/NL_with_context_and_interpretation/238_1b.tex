The thermodynamic mean temperature can be determined as follows:  

Equation:  
T_mean = Q_ab / (m_in (s_out - s_in))  

Entropy equation:  
s_out - s_in = integral from T_in to T_out of c_l divided by T dt = c_l ln(T_out / T_in)  

Value:  
c_l = 0.034115  

Calculation:  
T_mean = Q_ab / (c_l ln(T_out / T_in)) = c_l * 0.034115
