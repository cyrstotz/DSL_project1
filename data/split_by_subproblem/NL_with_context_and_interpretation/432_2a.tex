A graph is drawn representing a T-s diagram with labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 connected to Point 2 via a curve.  
- Point 2 connected to Point 3 via a vertical line labeled "p2".  
- Point 3 connected to Point 4 via a curve.  
- Point 4 connected to Point 5 via a curve labeled "p5 = 0.5 bar".  
- Point 5 connected to Point 6 via a curve.  
- Point 6 connected back to Point 0 via a dashed line.  

The x-axis is labeled "s [kJ/kg·K]" and the y-axis is labeled "T [K]".

Delta exergy of the stream equals exergy at state 6 minus exergy at state 0, which is equal to the mass flow rate multiplied by the enthalpy difference minus the surrounding temperature multiplied by the entropy difference plus the change in kinetic energy.  

Delta kinetic energy equals w6 squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals:  
\[ c_p \cdot (T_6 - T_0) - T_0 \cdot \text{ln}(T_6 / T_0) + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2} \]  

Delta exergy of the stream equals:  
\[ 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \cdot (325.09 - 243.15) - 243.15 \cdot \text{ln}(325.09 / 243.15) + \frac{220^2 - 200^2}{2} \]  

Delta exergy of the stream equals:  
\[ 122.21 \, \text{kJ/kg} \]
