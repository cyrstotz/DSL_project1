Exergy loss of the jet engine.  

Exergy loss equals temperature at state 0 multiplied by entropy generation.  

Temperature at state 0 equals 243.15 Kelvin.  

Entropy generation equals (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0) plus heat transfer divided by thermodynamic mean temperature.  

Entropy generation equals (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0) plus heat transfer divided by thermodynamic mean temperature, which equals 1.2284.  

Entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0 equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 0), which equals 0.30136 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Heat transfer divided by thermodynamic mean temperature equals 0.922 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Exergy loss equals temperature at state 0 multiplied by entropy generation, which equals 298.694 kilojoules per kilogram.
