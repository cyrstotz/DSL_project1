The pressure of the gas \( p_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,1} \):  
\( p_{g,1} = \frac{m_K \cdot g}{A} + p_{amb} \)  
\( = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \), since the mass of the piston and the atmospheric pressure remain constant (density difference between phases is negligible).  

\( T_{g,2} = T_{EW,2} = \text{Thermodynamic equilibrium temperature} \)  
\( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \), since the system is still in equilibrium with ice in water. The water does not heat further because the ice has not completely melted.
