A second T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as 's' (entropy), and the vertical axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
- State points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- State 5 is labeled with '0.5 bar'.  
- State 6 is labeled with '0.191 bar'.  
- Processes between states are labeled with arrows indicating transitions.

The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is calculated as:  
Δeₓₛₜᵣ = eₓₛₜᵣ,₆ - eₓₛₜᵣ,₀ = h₀ - h₆ - T₀ (s₆ - s₀) + (w₆ squared - w₀ squared) divided by 2  

Substituting entropy terms:  
Δeₓₛₜᵣ = cp [T₀ - T₆ - T₀ ln(T₆/T₀)] + (w₆ squared - w₀ squared) divided by 2  

Further substitution:  
Δeₓₛₜᵣ = cp [340 K - 243.15 K - 243.15 K ln(340 K / 243.15 K)] + (240 squared - 200 squared) divided by 2  

Final result:  
Δeₓₛₜᵣ = 25.5 kJ/kg
