Statistical FP:  
0 equals Delta exergy_out plus 1 minus T_0 divided by T multiplied by Q_dot_B minus W_dot_t minus exergy_loss.  

Adiabatic turbine condition applies.  

W_dot_t equals W_dot_HP plus W_dot_V.  

W_dot_HP equals h_6 minus h_4 plus (w_6 squared minus w_4 squared divided by 2) plus Q_B divided by (c_p multiplied by (T_4 minus T_0)).
