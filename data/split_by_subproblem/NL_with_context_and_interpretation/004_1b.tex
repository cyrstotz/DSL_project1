Thermodynamic mean temperature T bar KF:  

Integral of dW plus pressure times dV equals zero.  

Integral from s in to s out of T ds equals s out minus s in.  

Substance model:  

Delta S equals mass times specific heat capacity times natural logarithm of (T out divided by T in).  

Delta U equals mass times specific heat capacity times (T out minus T in).  

T bar equals (T out minus T in) divided by natural logarithm of (T out divided by T in) equals 293.72 Kelvin.
