O equals m dot multiplied by the quantity h zero minus h a plus w two squared minus w a squared divided by two, plus Q dot minus W dot.  

Isentropic state change  

u equals H equals 1.9  

T two divided by T n equals the quantity u two divided by u n raised to the power of n minus one divided by n.  

Here:  
T six divided by T five equals the quantity u zero divided by u five raised to the power of k minus one divided by k.  

T six equals T five multiplied by the quantity u zero divided by u five raised to the power of k minus one divided by k, equals 328.07 Kelvin.
