A diagram is drawn showing a p-T curve with labeled points and regions.  
- The curve includes labeled points: 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- The region labeled "MD - KÃ¼hlt." (MD cooling) is marked.  
- The curve transitions through different phases, including "isobar" and "sublimation."  
- The temperature axis is labeled as "T_i [K]" and the pressure axis as "p [bar]."  
- The diagram includes annotations such as "Druck [pressure]" and "Temperatur [temperature]."
