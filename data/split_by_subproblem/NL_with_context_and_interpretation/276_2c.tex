Delta exergy of the stream equals [h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0) plus kinetic energy at state 6].  

h6 minus h0 equals cp times (T6 minus T0).  
s6 minus s0 equals cp times the natural logarithm of (T6 divided by T0) plus k times the natural logarithm of (p6 divided by p0).  

This is isobaric, where p6 equals p0.  

T0 equals negative 30 degrees Celsius, which is 243.15 Kelvin.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals cp times [T6 minus T0] minus T0 times the natural logarithm of (T6 divided by T0) plus one-half times w6 squared.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals 13,084 kilojoules per kilogram.
