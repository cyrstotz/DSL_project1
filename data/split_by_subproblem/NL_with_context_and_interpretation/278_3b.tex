\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \)  

The system must remain in equilibrium with the surroundingsâ€”pressure and gravitational force!  

\( \Rightarrow p_{g,2} = 1.40 \, bar \)  

\( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ C \)  

The gas is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the ice-water mixture, where \( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \). It must therefore remain at \( T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ C \), and thus the gas temperature is also \( 0^\circ C \)!
