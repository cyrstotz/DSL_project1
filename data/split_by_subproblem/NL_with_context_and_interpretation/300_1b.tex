T_mean equals the integral of T multiplied by ds divided by s_2 minus s_1.  

s_2 minus s_1 equals c_if multiplied by the natural logarithm of T_2 divided by T_1.  

The integral of T multiplied by ds equals s_2 minus s_1.  

T_mean equals (T_1 plus T_2) divided by 2, which equals 233.15 degrees Celsius.  

This is because c_if is constant.
