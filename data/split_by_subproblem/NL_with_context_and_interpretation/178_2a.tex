The page contains three diagrams labeled with axes and points.  

1. **Top Diagram**:  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kg]'.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
   - The diagram shows a curved line with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
   - Between points 2 and 3, the process is labeled 'isobaric'.  
   - Between points 5 and 6, there is an arrow indicating flow.  
   - The line between points 3 and 4 is labeled 'p2 = p3'.  

2. **Bottom Left Diagram**:  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 's'.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
   - The diagram shows a similar curved line with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.  
   - The process between points 2 and 3 is labeled 'isobaric'.  

3. **Bottom Right Diagram**:  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 's'.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
   - The diagram shows a curved line with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.  
   - The process between points 2 and 3 is labeled 'isobaric'.  
   - The process between points 5 and 6 is labeled 'isobaric'.  

All diagrams are drawn on a grid background.

The equation is written as:  
dS over dt equals the summation of m dot sub i of t multiplied by s sub i of t plus the integral of dQ dot of t over T sub G of t plus S dot sub erz of t.
