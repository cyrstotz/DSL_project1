cv = cp divided by k = 0.71853 kJ/kg·K  

R = cp minus cv = 0.2889 kJ/kg·K

Delta ex_str equals h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 multiplied by (s_0 minus s_6) plus w_6 squared divided by 2 minus w_0 squared divided by 2.  

h_6 minus h_0 equals c_p multiplied by (T_0 minus T_6) equals 85.439 kilojoules per kilogram.  

s_0 minus s_6 equals c_p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_0 divided by T_6) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p_6 divided by p_0) equals negative 0.3013 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

w_6 squared divided by 2 minus w_0 squared divided by 2 equals negative 108.649 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta ex_str equals 96.187 kilojoules per kilogram.
