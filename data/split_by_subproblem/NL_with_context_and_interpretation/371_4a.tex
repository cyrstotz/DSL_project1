A p-T diagram is drawn with the following labels:  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'p [bar]'.  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
- The curve represents phase regions, with the left side labeled 'gesättigte Flüssigkeit' (saturated liquid), the right side labeled 'gesättigter Dampf' (saturated vapor), and the middle labeled 'Nassdampf' (wet steam).  
- Horizontal lines are drawn across the curve, labeled 'isobar' and 'adiabat'.  
- Points are marked as '1', '2', and '3' along the curve.
