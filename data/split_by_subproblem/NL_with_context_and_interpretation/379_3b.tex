\( x_{\text{Ice},2} > 0 \rightarrow T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  
Thermal equilibrium: \( Q = 0 \rightarrow T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} = T_{\text{EW}} \)  

\( p_{g,2} \): The weight on the piston does not change.  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.400942 \, \text{bar} \)  

Explanation: Since the ice content is greater than zero, this means the ice-water temperature remains constant and, in state 2, no heat transfer exists anymore. Thus, the second gas temperature must be \( 0^\circ \text{C} \). Additionally, the pressure remains constant because the piston force remains constant.
