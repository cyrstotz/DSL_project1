Tgas2 equals 0 degrees Celsius equals 273.15 kelvin.  

Since xIce2 is greater than 0, the temperature of EW in state 2 is 0 degrees Celsius. Since state 2 is already at equilibrium (final state), the temperature of the gas is equal to that of EW, thus 0 degrees Celsius.  

Pgas2 equals Pgas1 equals 1.4 bar.  

Since the mass above is unchanged, the pressure must remain constant so that the gas can "carry" the mass, i.e., remain in equilibrium.
