A diagram is drawn representing a T-s (temperature-entropy) process. The diagram includes labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 above point 0.  
- Point 2 to the right of point 1.  
- Point 3 above point 2, labeled with \( P_2 \).  
- Point 4 to the right of point 3, labeled with \( P_5 \).  
- Point 5 below point 4.  
- Point 6 below point 5, aligned horizontally with point 0, labeled with \( P_0 \).  

The curve connecting points 3 and 4 is labeled "isobare" (isobaric).  
The axes are labeled:  
- Horizontal axis: \( S \) (entropy).  
- Vertical axis: \( h \) (specific enthalpy) or \( T \) (temperature).
