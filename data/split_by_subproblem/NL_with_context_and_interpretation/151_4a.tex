A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The pressure axis is labeled with values ranging from 0.01 to 10 bar, and the temperature axis ranges from -50°C to 10°C. The graph includes the following labeled regions and points:  
- A curve labeled "isobar" and "gas" transitioning into "flüssig" (liquid).  
- Points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4" connected by arrows indicating transitions.  
- A vertical line labeled "6K" between points "1" and "2".  
- The region between points "3" and "4" is labeled "isobar".  
- The region between points "2" and "3" is labeled "isotherm".
