The mass flow rate of R134a is calculated using the following equation:  
Q equals m-dot multiplied by (he minus ha) minus Wk.  

m-dot equals Wk divided by (he minus ha), which equals 28 W divided by (he minus ha).  

Wk equals 25 W.  

he and ha are to be determined from Table A-11.  

he equals (value not provided).
