A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states.  
- The diagram includes states 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The axes are labeled: entropy (S) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K) on the x-axis and temperature (T) on the y-axis.  
- The process transitions are marked as isobaric and isentropic.

U_Fe2 = (333.82 - 333.498) / (2.9 - 2)  
= 333.498 = 333.533 kJ/kg
