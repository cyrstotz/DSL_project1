Given \( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \):  

Using \( p = \frac{mRT}{V} \):  
\( p = \frac{3.422 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 8.314 \cdot 273.15}{3.14 \cdot 10^{-3}} \)  
\( = 0.495 \, \text{bar} \).  

Since ice is still present, \( T_{EW} \) must remain at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \), as thermodynamic equilibrium requires \( T_{g,2} \) and \( T_{EW} \) to be \( 0^\circ \text{C} \). The pressure is therefore calculated accordingly.
