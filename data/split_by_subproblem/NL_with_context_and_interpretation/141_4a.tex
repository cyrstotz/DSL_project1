A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn. The y-axis is labeled as "p" (pressure), and the x-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature). The diagram includes three points labeled "1", "2", and "3".  
- Point "1" is at the lower left, near the curve labeled "isotherpe".  
- Point "2" is on the curve labeled "isotherpe".  
- Point "3" is above point "2" and connected by a line labeled "isentrope".  
The curve labeled "isotherpe" extends downward and curves to the right.
