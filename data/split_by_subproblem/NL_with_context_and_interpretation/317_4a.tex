A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T [°C]" (temperature).  
- The y-axis is labeled as "p [mbar]" (pressure).  

The diagram includes:  
- A curve labeled "Triple" indicating the triple point.  
- Regions labeled "gas," "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "isotherm" (isothermal).  
- Points labeled "1," "2," and "3" connected by vertical and horizontal lines.  
- The isobaric and isothermal processes are indicated.
