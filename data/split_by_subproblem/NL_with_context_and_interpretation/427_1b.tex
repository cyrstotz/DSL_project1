C equals constant. Therefore, S(T equals 298.15 Kelvin) minus S(T equals 288.15 Kelvin) equals integral from T sub 2 to T sub 1 of 1 divided by T dT equals C multiplied by ln(T sub 2 divided by T sub 1).  

T bar sub KF equals integral from S sub a to S sub e of T dS divided by S sub a minus S sub e equals T sub a minus T sub e divided by C multiplied by ln(298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin) equals [...] approximately 298 Kelvin.
