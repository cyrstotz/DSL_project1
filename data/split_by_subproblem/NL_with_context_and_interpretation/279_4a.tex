Two diagrams are drawn, both with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis.  

1. The first diagram shows labeled regions for "Eis" (ice), "Wasser" (water), and "Dampf" (steam).  
   - A line labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point) is marked where the three phases meet.  
   - Points 1, 2, and 3 are connected by arrows, indicating transitions between phases.  
   - The diagram includes a region labeled "liquid," and arrows point to transitions between ice, water, and steam.  

2. The second diagram similarly shows regions for "Eis" (ice), "Wasser" (water), and "Dampf" (steam).  
   - Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked, with arrows indicating transitions.  
   - A vertical line labeled "b2" is drawn in the ice region.
