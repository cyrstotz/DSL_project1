Exergy flow rate equals mass flow rate times the specific exergy, which equals mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 0 minus the product of ambient temperature and the entropy difference between states 6 and 0.  

Kinetic energy change equals one-half times mass flow rate times the square of the velocity difference, which equals one-half times mass flow rate times the square of the velocity at state 6 minus the square of the velocity at state 0.  

Exergy flow rate at state 0 equals mass flow rate times the specific exergy at state 0, which equals mass flow rate times enthalpy at state 0.  

The change in exergy flow rate equals the exergy flow rate at state 6 minus the exergy flow rate at state 0, which equals mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 0 minus the product of ambient temperature and the entropy difference between states 6 and 0 plus the change in kinetic energy.  

The change in kinetic energy equals one-half times mass flow rate times the square of the velocity difference, which equals one-half times mass flow rate times the square of the velocity difference between 510 meters per second and 200 meters per second.  

From Table A-22:  
The enthalpy at state 0 (243 Kelvin, 0.1 kilograms per second) equals the interpolated value between 250.05 and 240.02, which equals 247.04 kilojoules per kilogram.  

The entropy difference between states 6 and 0 equals the entropy at ambient temperature minus the entropy at state 6 minus the product of the gas constant and the natural logarithm of the ratio of pressure at state 0 to pressure at state 6.
