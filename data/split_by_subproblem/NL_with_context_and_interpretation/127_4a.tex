A diagram is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and an unspecified variable (likely temperature or entropy) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- The process from state 1 to state 2 is labeled "isobar."  
- The process from state 3 to state 4 is labeled "isobar."  
- There is a curved line connecting states 2 and 3, labeled "ND."  
Arrows indicate the direction of the processes.
