Exergy loss:  
0 equals mass flow rate multiplied by (minus delta exergy stream) plus (1 minus ambient temperature divided by temperature at state B) multiplied by heat flow at state B minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals mass flow rate multiplied by (minus delta exergy stream) plus (1 minus ambient temperature divided by temperature at state B) multiplied by heat flow at state B.  

Exergy loss equals 100 kilojoules per kilogram plus (1 minus 243.15 Kelvin divided by 1289 Kelvin) multiplied by 1195 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Exergy loss equals 1069.55 kilojoules per kilogram.
