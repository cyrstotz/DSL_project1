\( p_{1g} = p_{2g} \) as it does not change from state 1.  

\( T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \)  

\( n = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = \frac{R + c_v}{c_v} = \frac{\frac{R}{M} + c_v}{c_v} \)  

\( = \frac{\frac{8.314}{50} + 0.633}{0.633} = 1.2627 \)  

\( T_2 = 500 \, \text{K} \left( \frac{1.4}{1} \right)^{\frac{0.2627}{1.2627}} \to 1 \)  

\( T_2 = T_1 \) as the pressure does not change, \( T \) remains constant.
