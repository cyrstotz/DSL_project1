A graph is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'T [Â°C]'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'p [bar]'.  

The graph shows a curve representing phase regions.  
- The curve starts at point 1, moves through points 2 and 3, and ends at point 4.  
- Point 1 is labeled as 'vapor'.  
- Point 2 is labeled as 'liquid'.  
- Point 3 is labeled as 'saturated damp'.  
- Point 4 is labeled as 'condensed'.
