P sub g,2 equals P sub g,1 equals 1.4 bar, because in the state change there is no additional mass that must counteract P sub g (since EW has constant mass and volume).  

T of ice is also constant because the aggregate state does not change (at constant P and T).  

T equals DV divided by mRT (because V decreases, T decreases, while the rest remains constant).
