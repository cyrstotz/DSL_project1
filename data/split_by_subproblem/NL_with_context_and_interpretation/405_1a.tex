The inlet mass flow rate is 0.3 kilograms per second.  

a) \( \dot{Q}_{out} \):  
\( \dot{Q}_R = 100,000 \, \text{W} \)  
\( T_R = 100^\circ \text{C} = 373.15 \, \text{K} \)  

Steady-state fluid process:  
0 equals \( \dot{m} (\text{h}_{e} - \text{h}_{a}) + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{Q}_{out} \) (reaction).  

0 equals \( \dot{m}_K (\text{h}_{ER} - \text{h}_{AK}) + \dot{Q}_{out} \).  

\( m_{ges} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \)  
\( x_D = 0.005 \)  

b)  
\( \bar{T} = \int_{a}^{c} T \, \text{d}s / (s_a - s_c) \)  

c)  
\( \dot{S}_{erz} = - \dot{Q}_{out} / \bar{T} \)  

d)  
\( \Delta \mathcal{E} = \sum m_i (\text{h}_i T) + \sum Q_i \)

The page contains a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram.  

- The vertical axis is labeled as "p" (pressure).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
- There is a dome-shaped curve dividing the diagram into regions.  

Regions are labeled as follows:  
- To the left of the dome: "Flüssig" (liquid).  
- Inside the dome: "Nass-Dampf" (wet steam).  
- To the right of the dome: "gasförmig Dampf" (gaseous steam).  

Additional text:  
- Below the dome, there is a crossed-out label "test".  
- The base of the dome is labeled "test".
