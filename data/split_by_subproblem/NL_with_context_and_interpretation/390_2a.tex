A graph is drawn with the title "Aufgabe 2" and labeled axes. The x-axis is labeled as entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kg·K), and the y-axis is labeled as temperature (T) in degrees Celsius (°C). The graph includes several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves.  
- Isobars are labeled as \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \).  
- \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) is noted.  
- The temperature at point 0 is marked as \(-30^\circ \text{C}\).  
- The process transitions are described in a list on the right side:  
  - 0 → 2: Adiabatic compression with \( \eta_{V,s} < 1 \).  
  - 2 → 3: Adiabatic pre-compression.  
  - 3 → 4: Isobaric heat addition.  
  - 4 → 5: Mixing.  
  - 5 → 6: Adiabatic nozzle expansion at \( p_0 \).
