"5 -> 6 isentrope Zustandsaenderung"  
(5 -> 6 isentropic state change)  

An equation is written:  
he = w squared divided by 2 / m dot = g Aw  

Constants and equations:  
k = 1.4  
T6 divided by T5 equals (p5 divided by p6) raised to the power of (k minus 1) divided by k  

Values:  
p0 equals p0 = 0.191 bar  
T5 equals 431.9 Kelvin  
p5 equals 0.5 bar  

Calculation:  
T6 equals T5 multiplied by (p5 divided by p6) raised to the power of (k minus 1) divided by k  
T6 equals 568.58 Kelvin  

The final result is underlined:  
T6 = 568.58 K

Energy balance SFP for the jet engine:  

O equals m dot multiplied by the quantity h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 plus w subscript 5 squared minus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2, plus O.  

O equals m dot multiplied by the integral of c subscript p multiplied by the quantity T subscript 5 minus T subscript 6, plus w subscript 5 squared minus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2.  

w subscript 6 squared minus w subscript 5 squared divided by 2 equals m dot multiplied by the integral of c subscript p multiplied by the quantity T subscript 5 minus T subscript 6.  

w subscript 6 squared equals 2 multiplied by c subscript p multiplied by the quantity T subscript 5 minus T subscript 6, minus w subscript 5 squared.  

w subscript 6 equals the square root of the quantity 2 multiplied by c subscript p multiplied by the quantity T subscript 5 minus T subscript 6, minus w subscript 5 squared.
