A pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram is drawn. The diagram includes a curved line representing phase transitions, with oscillations along the curve. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "p" (pressure).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "T" (temperature).  

Another smaller diagram is shown with axes labeled:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "P [ln]" (logarithmic pressure).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).
