Negative delta exergy specific equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state a minus ambient temperature multiplied by the difference between entropy at state 6 and entropy at state a, plus the difference in velocity squared divided by two.  

Negative delta exergy specific divided by mass flow rate equals enthalpy at negative thirty degrees minus enthalpy at three hundred forty Kelvin minus ambient temperature multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of ambient temperature divided by reference temperature, plus the difference in velocity squared divided by two.  

Enthalpy at two hundred ninety-three point one five Kelvin equals enthalpy at two hundred forty degrees plus two hundred ninety-three point one five Kelvin minus two hundred forty Kelvin multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at two hundred fifty degrees and enthalpy at two hundred forty degrees.  

Enthalpy at two hundred ninety-three point one five Kelvin equals two hundred forty-three point one five zero kilojoules per kilogram.  

Negative delta exergy specific divided by mass flow rate equals two hundred forty-three point one five zero kilojoules per kilogram minus three hundred forty point four two kilojoules per kilogram minus two hundred forty-three point one five Kelvin multiplied by one point zero zero six kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by the natural logarithm of three hundred forty Kelvin divided by two hundred ninety-three point one five Kelvin, plus two hundred squared meters per second squared minus five hundred ten squared meters per second squared divided by two.  

Delta exergy specific divided by mass flow rate equals eleven thousand twenty-three point two seven kilojoules per kilogram.
