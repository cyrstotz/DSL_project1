Exergy loss equals E dot exergy loss divided by m dot stream, which equals T0 times S dot entropy production.  

Entropy balance:  
Zero equals m dot stream times s0 minus m dot stream times s6 plus Q dot divided by T0 plus S dot entropy production.  

S dot entropy production equals m dot stream divided by m dot stream times s6 minus s0.

Mass flow balance at the mixing chamber:  
m dot stream times (h0 minus hNS) equals m dot stream times (h0 minus hN).  

Efficiency of the mixing chamber equals h0 minus hNS divided by h0 minus hN, which equals m dot stream divided by m dot stream.
