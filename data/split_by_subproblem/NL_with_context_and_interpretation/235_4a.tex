A pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram is drawn. The diagram includes labeled phase regions and processes:  
- The y-axis is labeled as "p" (pressure) with a marker at "1 mbar".  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
- A curve is drawn, labeled "Triple Point".  
- The diagram includes three states labeled "1", "2", and "3".  
  - State 1 is connected to State 2 via an "Isobar" process.  
  - State 2 is connected to State 3 via an "Isotherm" process.  
- The temperature \( T_i \) is marked on the x-axis.
