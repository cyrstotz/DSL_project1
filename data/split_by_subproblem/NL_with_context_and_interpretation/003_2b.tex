The energy equation is written as:  
dE/dt = summation of (m_i(t) * h_i(t) + l_e_i(t) + p_e_i(t)) + summation of q_i(t) - summation of w_in(t).  

An expression for energy is provided:  
0 = m_gas * (h_s - h_6) + (w_s squared / 2 - w_6 squared / 2) - integral from 1 to n of rho * dv.  

The enthalpy difference is expressed as:  
h_s - h_6 = integral from T_6 to T_s of c_p(T) dT = c_p * (T_s - T_6).  

The term "m_gas" is written below the equations.
