Mean temperature \( T_{KF} \):  
\( T_{KF,out} = 298.15 \, \text{K} = T_{K2} \)  
\( T_{KF,in} = 288.15 \, \text{K} = T_{K1} \)  

The mean temperature \( T \) is calculated as:  
\( T = \frac{\int_{s_e}^{s_a} T \, ds}{s_a - s_e} \)  

This simplifies to:  
\( T = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{\ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)} = 293.12 \, \text{K} \)
