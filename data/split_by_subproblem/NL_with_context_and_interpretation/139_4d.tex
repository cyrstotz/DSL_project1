The coefficient of performance (COP) equation is written as:  
COP = |QK| / |WK| = [|Qabs| - |Qzu|] / |WK| = |QK| / |WK|  

The heat transfer equation is expanded as:  
QK = "Energiebilanz"  
QK = ṁR134a (hc - ha + wc² - wa² / 2 + eg (ze - za))  

Further simplified:  
dE/dt = ΣQi - ΣnWn  

Energy terms are defined:  
E = U + KE + PE → ΔE = U  

ΔV = QK
