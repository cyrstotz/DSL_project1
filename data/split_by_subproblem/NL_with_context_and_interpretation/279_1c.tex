Zero equals the inlet mass flow rate multiplied by the difference in entropy (se minus sa), plus the heat flow removed divided by the thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant, plus the reaction heat flow divided by the reactor temperature, plus the entropy production.  

Entropy production equals the inlet mass flow rate multiplied by the difference in entropy (sa minus se), minus the heat flow removed divided by the thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant.  

Entropy production equals negative heat flow removed divided by the thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant.  

Entropy production equals 0.212 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
