A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" and the y-axis labeled as "T [K]". The graph contains three isobars labeled as "isobar 0 = p0", "isobar 1 = p5", and "isobar 2". Points labeled "1", "2", "3", "5", and "6" are marked on the graph, with arrows indicating transitions between these states. The graph visually represents a thermodynamic process.
