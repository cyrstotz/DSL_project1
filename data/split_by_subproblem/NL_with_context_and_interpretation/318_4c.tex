T2 equals negative 22 degrees Celsius.  
s2 equals sf plus x times (sg minus sf).  
x equals (s2 minus sf) divided by (sg minus sf).  

s3 equals s2 because compression is isentropic.  
s2 is determined through interpolation between 20 and... (crossed out text).  
k1 equals 0.0351 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Throttle is isenthalpic.  
u7 equals u2.  
u4 equals 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.  

u equals uf plus x times (ug minus uf).  
x equals (u minus uf) divided by (ug minus uf).  
uf and ug are at the outlet pressure.
