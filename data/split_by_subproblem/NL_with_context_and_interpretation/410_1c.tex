T KF equals 293 Kelvin divided by Q dot out equals 65 kilowatts.  

0 equals Q dot out divided by T reactor minus Q dot out divided by T KF plus S dot erz.  

S dot erz equals Q dot out divided by T KF minus Q dot out divided by T reactor.  
S dot erz equals 46.146 kilojoules.  

Diagram:  
A rectangular diagram is shown with Q dot out pointing upwards and Q dot in pointing downwards.
