A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a curve labeled with points 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left of the curve.  
- Point 2 is on the lower part of the curve.  
- Point 3 is at the top right of the curve.  
- Point 4 is on the upper flat section of the curve.  

In the top right corner, there is a small schematic diagram with the following labels:  
1 → "locker → applied"  
2 → "T → deter."  
3 → "P →"  
4 → "inner → P lower."
