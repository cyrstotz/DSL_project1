A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points and processes:  
- Point 0 is marked as "isentrop".  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 via an "isobar".  
- Point 3 connects to point 4 via an "isobar".  
- Point 4 connects to point 5 via an "isobar".  
- Point 5 connects to point 6 via an "isobar".  
- The axes are labeled:  
  - Horizontal axis: "s [kJ/kg·K]"  
  - Vertical axis: "[°C]"

Exergy equals total entropy.  

Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by (entropy at state 0 minus entropy at state 6) plus heat flow divided by ambient temperature plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals mass flow rate multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0).  

Entropy production equals mass flow rate multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by ambient temperature) minus gas constant multiplied by the natural logarithm of (pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at state 1).  

Entropy production divided by mass flow rate equals 1.006 multiplied by the natural logarithm of (340 Kelvin divided by 253.15 Kelvin) equals 0.337727 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Exergy equals total entropy equals negative (301273.15) plus 0.337727 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Equals 82,003 kilojoules.
