A graph is drawn with the axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "[K] T" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "[R2 by k] S" (entropy).  

The graph shows several curves representing isobars, with labels such as "p2 = p3," "p5 = p4," and "p10."  

An orange process path is drawn on the graph, connecting points labeled 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4.5, and 6. The path includes vertical and diagonal segments, with annotations such as "isobars" written near the curves.

A table is drawn with the following columns and rows:  

Columns:  
- \( T \)  
- \( w \)  
- \( Q \)  
- \( \eta \)  

Rows:  
- 0: \( T_0 = -30^\circ \text{C} \), \( w = 200 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- 1: \( T_1 = \text{adiabatic process} \)  
- 2: \( T_2 = \text{adiabatic process} \)  
- 3: \( T_3 = 1289 \, \text{K} \), \( \eta = \text{isentropic efficiency} \)  
- 4: \( T_4 = \text{adiabatic process} \)  
- 5: \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \), \( w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- 6: \( T_6 = \text{adiabatic process} \), \( w_6 = \text{exit velocity} \)  

Additional notes in the table:  
- \( \dot{Q}_B = \frac{\dot{Q}_B}{\dot{m}_K} = 1195 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
- \( T_B = 1289 \, \text{K} \)
