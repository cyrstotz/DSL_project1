A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. Three phase regions are labeled:  
- "Fest" (solid)  
- "Fl√ºssig" (liquid)  
- "Gas" (gas)  

Two processes are marked:  
- Process "i)" transitions from the solid phase to the liquid phase.  
- Process "ii)" transitions from the liquid phase to the gas phase.
