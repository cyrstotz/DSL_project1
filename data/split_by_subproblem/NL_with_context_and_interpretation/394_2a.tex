A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [h2/kgK]". The graph shows six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, connected by curves.  
- Between points 0 and 1, the curve rises steeply.  
- Between points 1 and 2, the curve continues upward.  
- Between points 2 and 3, the curve rises sharply again.  
- Between points 3 and 4, the curve descends slightly.  
- Between points 4 and 5, the curve rises again.  
- Between points 5 and 6, the curve descends slightly.  

Annotations on the graph:  
- "isobare bei p3 = p2" near points 2 and 3.  
- "isobare bei p4 = p5" near points 4 and 5.  
- "isobare bei p1 = p0" near points 5 and 6.
