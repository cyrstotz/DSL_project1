A graph is drawn with labeled axes. The x-axis is marked as 's in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K)', and the y-axis is marked as 'T in Kelvin (K)'. The graph depicts a qualitative T-s diagram with six labeled points: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 2 is vertically above point 1.  
- Point 3 is higher and to the right of point 2, with a steep curve upward.  
- Point 4 is to the right of point 3, with a downward curve.  
- Point 5 is below point 4, and point 6 is to the right of point 5.  
The pressure is labeled as 'p = 0.5 bar' near points 5 and 6.
