A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph represents a thermodynamic process with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The process includes isentropic and isobaric sections. A note indicates "isobar p = 0.1916 bar" and "isobaric reversible" near the graph.
