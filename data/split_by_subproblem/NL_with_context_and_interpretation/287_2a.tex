A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. The diagram includes the following:  
- Point 1 is labeled as "setup."  
- Point 2 is labeled as "isobar."  
- Point 3 is labeled as "isentrop."  
- Point 5 is labeled as "isobar (0.5 bar)."  
- Point 6 is labeled as "isobar (0.191 bar)."  
The x-axis is labeled as \( Ds \, [\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}] \), and the y-axis is labeled as \( T \, [\text{K}] \).
