Assumption: T KF equals 295 Kelvin.  

Zero equals negative Q dot out divided by T reactor,1 plus Q dot out divided by T KF plus S dot gen.  

S dot gen equals Q dot out divided by T reactor,1 minus Q dot out divided by T KF equals negative 62.18 divided by 373.15 minus negative 62.18 divided by 295 equals 0.044 kilowatts per Kelvin.  

A diagram is shown with arrows labeled Q dot out and Q dot out pointing to and away from a vertical rectangle.  

Annotations include "Wand" (German for "wall").
