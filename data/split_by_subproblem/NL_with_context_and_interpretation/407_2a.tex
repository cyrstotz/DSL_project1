A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and process points. The diagram includes the following:  
- Three curved lines representing isobars, labeled with pressures (e.g., 0.5 bar, 1.45 bar, 1.99 bar).  
- Points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 along the curves, indicating different states in the process.  
- Vertical lines connecting points 1 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 to 6, representing transitions between states.  
- Horizontal arrows indicating directions of processes.
