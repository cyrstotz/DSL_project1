The energy balance is expressed as:  
\( m (u_{2g} - u_{1g}) + Q_{12} = 0 \).  

A diagram shows heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) from the gas to the ice-water mixture (EW).  

The heat transfer \( Q_{12} \) is calculated as:  
\( m_g (c_V (T_{g,2} - T_{g,1})) = Q_{12} \).  

The specific heat \( c_V \) is given as:  
\( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \).  

Substituting values:  
\( 0.02777 \, \text{kg} \cdot 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \cdot (-499.997 \, \text{K}) = Q_{12} \).  

The result is:  
\( Q_{12} = -7.21 \, \text{kJ} \).  

This represents the heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture (EW).
