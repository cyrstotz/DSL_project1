The energy equation for system 6, which is stationary, is written as:  
\( \dot{m} \cdot \frac{w_6^2}{2} + h_6 = \dot{m} \cdot \frac{w_5^2}{2} + h_5 \).  

The rest mass flow rate is:  
\( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \) was found in Table A-22, and the inlet pressure is \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  

\( h_2 (431.9 \, \text{K}) = \frac{h_{g}(431.9) - h_{f}(431.9)}{404} \cdot (1.431) + h_{f}(431.9) = 133.36 \).  

\( h_{a} (0.5 \, \text{bar}) = h_{g, 0.5 \, \text{bar}} - h_{f, 0.5 \, \text{bar}} \cdot (0.5 - 0.4690) + h_{f, 0.4690} = \).
