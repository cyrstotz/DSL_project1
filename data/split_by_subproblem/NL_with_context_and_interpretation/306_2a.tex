A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points:  
- \( T \) (temperature) is on the vertical axis in Kelvin (K).  
- \( s \) (entropy) is on the horizontal axis in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (\( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)).  
- Points are labeled as \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), and \( 5 \).  
- The diagram shows curves connecting the points, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
