Delta ex_str equals ex_str,6 minus ex_str,0 equals ?  

Delta ex_str,6 equals Delta h_06 minus T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0) plus Delta ke_06  

Delta h_06 equals the integral from T_0 to T_6 of c_p dT equals c_p multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) equals 360 multiplied by (431.9 minus 243.15) equals 68,652 J/kg  

Delta S equals the integral from T_0 to T_6 of (c_p divided by T) dT minus R multiplied by ln(p_6 divided by p_0)  

equals c_p multiplied by (ln(T_6) minus ln(T_0)) minus R multiplied by ln(p_6 divided by p_0)  

equals 1.006 multiplied by ln(431.9 divided by 243.15) minus 0.287 multiplied by ln(0.5 divided by 0.191)  

equals 6.30135 J/kgK  

Delta ke_06 equals (w_6 squared minus w_0 squared) divided by 2 equals (220 squared minus 200 squared) divided by 2 equals 108,642 J/kg  

=> Delta ex_str equals Delta h minus T_0 multiplied by Delta s plus Delta ke equals 118,426 J/kg
