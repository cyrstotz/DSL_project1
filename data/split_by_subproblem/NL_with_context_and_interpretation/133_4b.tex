- \( \dot{m}_{R134a} \):  
  Transition from state 2 to state 3 is isentropic, meaning entropy remains constant.  
  Transition from state 3 to state 4 involves gas-liquid mixture condensation.  
  Transition from state 4 to state 1 is isenthalpic.  

First law of thermodynamics:  
\( Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K \).
