\( p \) remains constant:  
=> Has the same conditions as state 1  

\( \frac{m_g}{A} + \dots \)  

We know the volume is smaller: From the gas law, it follows that \( T_2 \) is smaller.  

\( \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{(n-1)/n} \)  
=> \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{0.2627} \)  

\( n = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = \frac{c_p - c_v + c_v}{c_v} \)  
= \( 1.2627 \)  

\( T_2 = 273.15312 \, \text{K} \)
