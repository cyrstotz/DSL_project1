xIce equals mIce divided by mEW.  
mEW equals 0.1 kilograms.  
TEW equals 0 degrees Celsius.  
Poutside equals 1.14 bar.  

PKS equals Pamb plus F divided by A.  
F equals mK times g.  
A equals r squared times pi.  
F equals 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared.  
A equals (0.05 meters squared) times pi equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.  

PKS equals 100,000 Pascal plus F divided by A equals 3,939,941 Pascal.  
Equals 139,839.44 divided by 4.3 equals 1.14 bar equals Poutside.  

V2 equals Vf plus x times (Vsolid minus Vf).
