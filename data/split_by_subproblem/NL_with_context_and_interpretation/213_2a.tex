A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the vertical axis labeled in Kelvin [K] and entropy (S) on the horizontal axis labeled in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin [kJ/kgÂ·K]. The graph shows a qualitative T-s diagram with labeled isobars and processes.  
- Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 along the curve.  
- The curve includes segments labeled "isobar" and "adiabat."  
- The isobar for \( p_0 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) is indicated.  
- The isobar for \( p_2 = p_3 \) is also noted.
