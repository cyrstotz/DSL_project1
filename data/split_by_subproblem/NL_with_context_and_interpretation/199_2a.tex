A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points:  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]' (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]' (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  
- Points are labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, connected by curves and lines representing the thermodynamic processes.  
- Isobars are indicated with labels \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), \( p_3 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_5 \).
