Two diagrams are drawn.  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with multiple curves. The axes are labeled as 'p' (pressure) on the vertical axis and 'T' (temperature) on the horizontal axis.  
2. The second diagram is also a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph. It includes labeled regions: 'fest' (solid), 'fl√ºssig' (liquid), and 'Gas' (gas). The sublimation point is marked, and the transition between phases is indicated with arrows.
