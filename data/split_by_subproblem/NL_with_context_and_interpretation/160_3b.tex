\( x_{ice,2} > 0 \)  
\( x_{ice,1} = \frac{m_{ice}}{m_{EW}} = 0.6 \)  

\( m_{ice} = 0.6 \cdot m_{EW} = 0.06 \, \text{kg} \)  

Gas and EW Thermodynamic Equilibrium:  

Since the density of ice and water are equal, the mass (and volume) of the ice-water mixture does not change. From the \( K \, G \, W \), it can be seen that \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \).  

\( p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \)

\( m_{g,1} = m_{g,2} = 3.422 \, \text{g} \)  

Since the mass of EW can be treated as water in equilibrium and \( x_2 > 0 \), the temperature \( T_{EW,2} = T_{EW,1} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

For thermodynamic equilibrium, \( T_{g,2} = T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).
