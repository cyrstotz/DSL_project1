T mean equals integral of T d divided by e over s d minus s e.  

s d minus s e equals 133.792 divided by 7.7221987 equals minus 6.384 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Equals beta times T minus s d minus s e.  

s d minus s e equals integral of c p times d T divided by T equals c p times ln of T e divided by T i.
