T KF bar equals integral from s in to s out of T d s divided by (s out minus s in).  

d H equals T d s plus v d p (ideal fluidity, p constant).  
h out minus h in divided by (s out minus s in) equals c p KF times (T out minus T in) divided by ln (T out divided by T in).  

T out minus T in divided by ln (T out divided by T in) equals 298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by ln (298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin).  
Equals 293.12 Kelvin.
