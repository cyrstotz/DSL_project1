Energy balance for water:  
0 equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at inlet minus enthalpy at outlet) plus reaction heat minus heat flow out.  

Enthalpy at inlet equals h at 70 degrees Celsius, which equals 232.98 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table A-2).  
Enthalpy at outlet equals h at 100 degrees Celsius, which equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table A-2).  

Heat flow out equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at inlet minus enthalpy at outlet) plus reaction heat.  
Heat flow out equals 62.13 kilojoules per second.  

Since heat is removed:  
Heat flow out equals negative 62.13 kilojoules per second.
