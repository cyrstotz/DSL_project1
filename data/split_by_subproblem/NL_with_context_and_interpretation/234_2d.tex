Exergy balance for stationary flow process:  
0 equals m-dot multiplied by minus Delta exergy stream plus (1 minus T_0 divided by T) multiplied by Q-dot minus psi-in minus exergy-out.  

Exergy-in equals minus Delta exergy stream plus (1 minus T_0 divided by T_B) multiplied by q_B.  
This equals minus 100 watts per kilogram plus (1 minus 243 kelvin divided by 1289 kelvin) multiplied by 1195 watts per kilogram.  
Exergy-in equals 869.72 watts per kilogram.
