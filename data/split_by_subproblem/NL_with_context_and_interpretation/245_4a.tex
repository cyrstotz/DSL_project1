Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph labeled with 'p [mbar]' on the y-axis and 'T [K]' on the x-axis. It shows a cycle with four states labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. The transitions between states are marked as 'isobar' and 'adiabat'.  
2. The second diagram is also a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with the same axis labels. It shows a similar cycle with states 1, 2, 3, and 4, and transitions labeled as 'isobar' and 'adiabat'.
