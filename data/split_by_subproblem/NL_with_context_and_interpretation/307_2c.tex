T6 equals 340.4 Kelvin; w6 equals 510 meters per second; T0 equals 243.15 Kelvin.  

Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream at state 6 minus exergy stream at state 0.  

Exergy stream at state 6 equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0) plus one-half w6 squared.  

Equals cp of air multiplied by (T6 minus T0) minus T0 multiplied by (cp of air multiplied by the natural logarithm of T6 divided by T0 minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of p6 divided by p0) plus one-half w6 squared.  

Molar mass of air equals 28.97 kilograms per kilomole. R equals universal gas constant divided by molar mass, equals 0.28698 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Exergy stream at state 6 equals 130 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Exergy stream at state 0 equals (h0 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s0 minus s0) plus one-half w0 squared) equals 40 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Therefore, Delta exergy stream equals 90 kilojoules per kilogram.
