A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a cycle with labeled points:  
- Point 1 and Point 2 are connected by a curve.  
- Point 3 and Point 4 are connected by another curve.  
- \( p_1 = p_2 \)  
- \( p_3 = p_4 = 8 \, \text{bar} \)  

Additional notes:  
- Zustand 2: Nassgas (wet gas)  
- Zustand 4: Reingas (pure gas)
