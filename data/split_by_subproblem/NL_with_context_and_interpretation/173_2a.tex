A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- Horizontal axis: S [kJ/kgÂ·K]  
- Vertical axis: T  

The diagram includes the following details:  
- Isobars labeled as \( p_0 = p_6 \), \( p_2 = p_3 \), and \( p_4 = p_5 \).  
- States labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Arrows indicating transitions between states.  

Below the diagram, a table is partially filled:  
- Row 0: \( T = -30^\circ C \), \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  
- Row 5: \( T = 158.75 \), \( p = 0.5 \).  
- Row 6: \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).
