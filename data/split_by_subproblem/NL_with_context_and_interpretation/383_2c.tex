Delta exergy of the stream equals E dot exergy stream divided by m dot stream, which equals:  
[h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0)]  

s6 minus s0 equals s0 of T6 minus s0 of T0 minus R times ln(p6 divided by p0).  
The term R times ln(p6 divided by p0) equals zero.  

h6 minus h0 equals 189.88 kilojoules per kilogram (from subtask b).
