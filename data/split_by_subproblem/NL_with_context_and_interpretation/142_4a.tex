A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 'T [°C]' and the y-axis labeled as 'p [bar]'. The graph represents a phase diagram with a curve transitioning from liquid to gas.  

Key points and annotations:  
- The curve starts at the bottom left and rises steadily, representing the phase boundary.  
- The region below the curve is labeled 'flüssig' (liquid).  
- A point on the curve is marked as 'p3 = 8 bar'.  
- Another point is marked as 'x2'.  
- The top right corner of the graph includes a label 'Fig. 3'.  

Additional notes:  
- The task is labeled as 'Aufgabe 4: a)' at the top of the page.
