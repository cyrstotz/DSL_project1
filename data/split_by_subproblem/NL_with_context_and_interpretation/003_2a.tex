A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points and processes:  
- Point 1 is marked at the beginning of an isentropic curve.  
- Point 2 is connected to point 1 via a reversible adiabatic process.  
- Point 3 is connected to point 2 via an isobaric process.  
- Point 4 is connected to point 3 via another isentropic curve.  
- Point 5 is connected to point 4 via an isobaric process.  
- Point 6 is connected to point 5 via an isentropic process.  
The diagram includes labels such as "reversible adiabatic," "isobar," and "p0 = p6."
