A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) (in bar) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) (in Kelvin) on the x-axis. The graph includes three labeled regions:  
- "fest" (solid) in the lower left.  
- "fl√ºssig" (liquid) in the upper middle.  
- "gas" (gas) in the lower right.  

Two processes are marked:  
- "i)" is a horizontal line in the liquid region.  
- "ii)" is a vertical line transitioning from the liquid region to the gas region.
