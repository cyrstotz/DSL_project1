Exergy balance, stationary, mass-specific:  

Zero equals h zero minus h six minus T zero multiplied by (s zero minus s six) plus Q zero plus one minus T zero divided by T B multiplied by Q B minus w zero minus exergy loss.  

Zero equals minus delta exergy flow.  

Exergy loss equals minus delta exergy flow plus one minus T zero divided by T B multiplied by Q B.  

Exergy loss equals minus 120.786 kilojoules per kilogram plus (one minus 263.15 Kelvin divided by 1289 Kelvin) multiplied by 1195 kilojoules per kilogram equals 898.796 kilojoules per kilogram.
