A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]" (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  

The diagram includes the following labeled points and processes:  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are marked.  
- Two isobars are labeled: "isobaric" processes are shown between points 0 → 1 and 3 → 4.  
- Two isochoric processes are labeled: "isochoric" processes are shown between points 1 → 2 and 4 → 5.  
- Arrows indicate the direction of the processes.
