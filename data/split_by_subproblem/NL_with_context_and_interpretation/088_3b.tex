T subscript g,2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.  
p subscript g,2 equals p subscript g,1 equals 1.966 bar.  

Temperature:  
Since x is greater than 0, the EW remains in equilibrium, and all the added heat is used for melting, not for temperature increase. The system remains at the same temperature.  

Pressure:  
Since the external pressure and the mass are constant, p automatically remains constant as well.
