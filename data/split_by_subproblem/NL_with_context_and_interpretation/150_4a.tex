A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn with the following labels:  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
- The y-axis is labeled as "P" (pressure).  
- Three regions are marked:  
  - "Fest" (solid) in the lower left.  
  - "Flüssig" (liquid) in the middle.  
  - "Gasförmig" (gaseous) in the upper right.  
- A line labeled "Tripel" (triple point) separates the solid, liquid, and gaseous regions.  
- Two processes are marked:  
  - "Isobar, i" (isobaric process in step i).  
  - "Isotherm, ii" (isothermal process in step ii).
