A temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram is drawn. The diagram includes labeled points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, connected by curves representing different thermodynamic processes.  
- Between points 1 and 2: labeled as "isobar."  
- Between points 2 and 3: labeled as "isobar."  
- Between points 3 and 4: labeled as "isobar."  
- Between points 4 and 5: labeled as "isobar."  
- Between points 5 and 6: labeled as "isobar."
