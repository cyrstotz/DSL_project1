Delta exergy equals mass multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and state 0 minus the product of temperature at state 0 and the difference in entropy at state 6 and state 0, plus the difference in kinetic energy at state 6 and state 0.  

Entropy difference:  
s_6 minus s_0 equals s_6 at temperature 6 minus s_0 at temperature 0 minus the gas constant multiplied by the natural logarithm of pressure ratio (p_6 divided by p_0).  

Using table values:  
s_6 at temperature 6 equals s_6 at 325 Kelvin minus s_0 at 293.15 Kelvin equals 1.78243 minus 1.78243 multiplied by (325 minus 293.15 divided by 325 minus 293.15).  

Enthalpy difference:  
h_0 equals h at 293.15 Kelvin equals 256.05 minus 240.02 divided by 290 minus 240 multiplied by (243.15 minus 240) plus 240.02 equals 293.21 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Exergy calculation:  
exergy at state 6 minus exergy at state 0 equals mass multiplied by (328.46 minus 283.21 minus 283.15 multiplied by (1.7794 minus 1.481)) plus one-half multiplied by (568.26 squared minus 200 squared).
