Delta exergy stream:  
0 equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state e minus enthalpy at state a minus ambient temperature multiplied by (entropy at state c minus entropy at state a)) plus velocity at state e squared divided by 2 minus velocity at state a squared divided by 2 equals minus delta exergy stream.  

Ambient temperature equals 243.15 Kelvin, temperature at state e equals 340 Kelvin.  
Enthalpy at state e minus enthalpy at state a equals specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at state e minus ambient temperature) equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by (96.85 Kelvin) equals 97.43 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Entropy at state c minus entropy at state a equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state e divided by ambient temperature) minus gas constant multiplied by the natural logarithm of (pressure at state e divided by ambient pressure).  

Entropy at state c minus entropy at state a equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state e divided by ambient temperature) equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by the natural logarithm of (243.15 Kelvin divided by 240 Kelvin) equals approximately 0.33.  

Delta exergy stream equals minus mass flow rate multiplied by (specific heat capacity multiplied by (enthalpy at state e minus enthalpy at state a) minus ambient temperature multiplied by (specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state e divided by ambient temperature)) plus velocity at state e squared divided by 2 minus velocity at state a squared divided by 2).
