Energy balance: SFP:  

Q equals delta exergy flow plus exergy heat minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals density exergy flow plus exergy heat.  

n divided by m multiplied by (1 minus T zero divided by T) multiplied by Q.  

Equals (1 minus T zero divided by T_B) multiplied by q_B.  

Exergy loss equals density exergy flow plus (1 minus T zero divided by T_B) multiplied by q_B.
