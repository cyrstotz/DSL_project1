T equals integral of T dS from S-a to S-e equals (h-a minus h-e) divided by (S-a minus S-e) equals c-p multiplied by (T-aus minus T-ein) divided by c-p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T-aus divided by T-ein).  

298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by the natural logarithm of (298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin) equals 293.12 Kelvin, which equals T-KF.
