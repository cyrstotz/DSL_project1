Sigma u divided by Sigma q equals:  

Two times (Sigma divided by Sigma q2) plus (q4 minus q4o82q) multiplied by Sigma divided by Sigma q2 multiplied by 900 r minus Sigma divided by Sigma q2 multiplied by 200 q.  

Sigma m plus (q4 minus q4o) divided by q2 equals:  

Sigma m plus (q4 minus q4o) divided by q2 equals Sigma m.  

Sigma m divided by q2 equals Sigma m divided by q2 plus (q4 minus q4o) divided by q2 equals Sigma m divided by q2.  

Sigma m divided by q2 equals Sigma m divided by q2 plus (q4 minus q4o) divided by q2 multiplied by u equals:  

(Sigma divided by Sigma q2 minus Sigma divided by Sigma q2) multiplied by u plus (q4 minus q4o) multiplied by u equals zero.  

x multiplied by t0o82q equals k multiplied by 8o82q.  

(0o950 divided by 0o950) equals:  

Sigma divided by Sigma q2 equals Sigma divided by Sigma q2 multiplied by u divided by v minus u equals Sigma divided by Sigma q2.
