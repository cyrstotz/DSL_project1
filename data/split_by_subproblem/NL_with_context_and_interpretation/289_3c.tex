Q twelve equals Q two.  

Energy balance results:  
dE divided by dt equals Q in minus Q out.  
Therefore, delta E equals delta U equals Q twelve.  

Delta U equals m two times u two minus m one times u one equals m gas times (u two minus u one) equals Q twelve.  

m gas times c V times (T gas two minus T gas one) equals Q twelve equals negative one thousand eighty-three point zero six joules.
