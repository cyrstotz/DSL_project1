The equation for \( w_6 \) (velocity at state 6) is derived:  
\( w_6 = \sqrt{2 \, (h_0 - h_6) + w_0^2} \)  
\( w_6 = \sqrt{2 \, c_{p}^{Luft} \, (T_0 - T_6) + w_0^2} \)  

\( w_0 = 200 \, \text{m/s} \)  
\( c_{p}^{Luft} = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)  

Additional crossed-out content is ignored.

w subscript 6 equals square root of two times c subscript p times ṁ divided by ṁ times (T subscript 0 minus T subscript 6) plus w subscript 5 squared.  
T subscript 6 equals fifteen times (0.181 divided by 0.5) times (0.4 divided by 1.4) equals three hundred twenty-eight Kelvin.
