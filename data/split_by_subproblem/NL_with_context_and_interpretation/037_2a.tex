A graph is drawn with temperature \( T \) (in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and entropy \( s \) (in \( \text{kJ}/\text{kgÂ·K} \)) on the horizontal axis. The graph represents a T-s diagram with labeled isobars:  
- Isobar at \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- Isobar at \( p_0 = 0.797 \, \text{bar} \)  

The diagram includes six states labeled as 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- State 0 is at the bottom left.  
- States 2, 3, and 4 are connected by curved lines, with state 3 at the peak.  
- States 4, 5, and 6 are connected by downward lines.  
- A dashed line connects states 4 and 5.
