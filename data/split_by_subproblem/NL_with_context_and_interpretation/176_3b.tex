The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) because the ice-water mixture has a temperature of \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) and is in thermodynamic equilibrium (since ice is still present).  
Since the weight from above (piston, ice-water mixture, atmospheric pressure) remains unchanged, the pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is \( p_{g} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).
