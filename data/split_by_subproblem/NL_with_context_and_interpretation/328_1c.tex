Entropy balance:  

Closed system, adiabatic:  

Delta S equals sum of entropy flow plus entropy production.  

Delta S equals sum of heat flow divided by T_j plus entropy production.  

Q_out divided by T_R plus entropy production equals Q_out divided by T_R minus Q_out divided by T_e plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals Q_out times (1 divided by T_R minus 1 divided by T_e).  

Entropy production equals minus 62 kilowatts times (1 divided by 373.15 Kelvin minus 1 divided by 293.15 Kelvin).  

Entropy production equals approximately 0.04615 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Entropy production equals approximately 46.15 joules per kilogram.
