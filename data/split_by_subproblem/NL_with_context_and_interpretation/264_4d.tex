The coefficient of performance (COP) is calculated using the formula:  
COP equals heat flow divided by work input, which equals heat flow divided by the difference between heat rejected and heat input.  
For cooling cycles:  
COP equals heat flow removed divided by the difference between heat rejected and heat input.  
In our case:  
Heat flow removed divided by the difference between heat rejected and heat input gives us the COP.
