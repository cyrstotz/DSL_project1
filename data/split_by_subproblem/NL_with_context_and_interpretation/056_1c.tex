The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{erz} \) is calculated using the equation:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} (s_e - s_a) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{\bar{T}} + \dot{S}_{erz} \).  

\( \dot{S}_{erz} = \dot{m}_{in} (s_{out} - s_{in}) + \frac{\dot{Q}_{out}}{\bar{T}} \).  

Entropy values are determined as follows:  
\( s_{in} = s_g(70^\circ C) = 7.2553 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \).  
\( s_{out} = s_g(100^\circ C) = 7.354 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \) (from Table A-3).  

The entropy production \( \dot{S}_{erz} \) is calculated as:  
\( \dot{S}_{erz} = 0.41 \, \text{kW/K} \).  

(Note: The entropy production is between water and coolant, not total entropy.)
