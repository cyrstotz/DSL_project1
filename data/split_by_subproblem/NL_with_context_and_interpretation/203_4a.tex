A graph is drawn with pressure (p in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in degrees Celsius) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows three labeled regions:  
- "Fest" (solid)  
- "Flüssig" (liquid)  
- "Gas" (gas)  

The triple point is marked as "Tripel." Two states are labeled:  
- State 1 is in the "Fest" region.  
- State 2 is in the "Gas" region.  

An arrow connects state 1 to state 2, crossing through the "Flüssig" region.
