\( \text{Required: } Q_{12} \)  

In this case, \( Q_{12} \) is simply the change in enthalpy of the gas, so:  
\( Q_{12} = \Delta h = h_2 - h_1 = m \cdot c_p^{\text{gas}} (T_2 - T_1) \)  

Because the pressure is constant:  
\( Q_{12} = 0.7933 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \cdot 2.68 \, \text{kg} \cdot (0^\circ \text{C} - 0^\circ \text{C}) = -1.073 \, \text{kJ} \)
