The mass flow rate of R134a is given as:  
\( \dot{m}_{R134a} = 4 \, \text{kg/h} \), \( T_2 = -22^\circ \text{C} \).  

The pressure at state 2 is calculated:  
\( p_2 = p(-22^\circ \text{C}) = 1.2192 \, \text{BAR} \).  

The temperature at state 1 equals the temperature at state 2:  
\( T_1 = T_2 \).  

The enthalpy at state 4 is equal to the enthalpy at state 1:  
\( h_4 = h_1 \).  

The throttling process is isenthalpic:  
\( h_4 = h_f(8 \, \text{BAR}) = 93.42 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

The vapor quality at state 1 is calculated:  
\( x_1 = \frac{h_4 - h_f(-22^\circ \text{C})}{h_{fg}(-22^\circ \text{C})} \approx 0.337 \).
