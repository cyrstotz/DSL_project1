Another graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis labeled in bar and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis labeled in Kelvin (K). The graph shows a similar phase diagram curve with additional annotations:  
- A horizontal line labeled "isobaric condensation" connects points 2 and 1.  
- Another horizontal line labeled "isothermal pressure reduction" connects points 3 and 1.  
- Dashed lines are drawn at 10 mbar and 5 mbar, indicating specific pressure levels.

Energy balance around the compressor:  

W dot h equals m dot times (h2 minus h3)
