A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [°C]" and ranges from -30°C to higher temperatures.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]".  
- The diagram includes several labeled points and curves:  
  - Point 0 is at the bottom left.  
  - Point 1 is marked along a curve labeled "isentrop u = h = 1.u".  
  - Point 2 is labeled along an upward curve.  
  - Point 3 is labeled along an "isobar" curve.  
  - Point 4 is labeled along another "isobar" curve.  
  - Point 5 is labeled along a curve marked "isobar ps = p6".  
  - Point 6 is labeled at the top right.  
- The curve transitions are marked with arrows indicating the flow of the process.
