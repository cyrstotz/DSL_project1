A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph represents a T-s diagram with six labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the origin.  
- Point 1 connected to Point 2 via a curve labeled "turbine".  
- Point 2 connected to Point 3 via a vertical line labeled "p3 = p2".  
- Point 3 connected to Point 4 via a horizontal line labeled "p4 = p3".  
- Point 4 connected to Point 5 via a curve labeled "isentropic".  
- Point 5 connected to Point 6 via a horizontal line labeled "p6 = p0".
