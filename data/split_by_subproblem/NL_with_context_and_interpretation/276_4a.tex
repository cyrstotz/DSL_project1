A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a curve resembling a phase diagram. The curve includes a critical point labeled "KP" at the peak. The regions are labeled as follows:  
- "i)" on the left side of the curve, indicating the liquid phase.  
- "ii)" on the right side of the curve, indicating the vapor phase.  
- A dashed line labeled "ii)" extends downward from the curve, representing sublimation.
