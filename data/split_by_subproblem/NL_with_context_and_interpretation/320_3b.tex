The pressure is the same as in state 1 because the forces acting on the piston have not changed. \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).  

The temperature has changed because energy was absorbed by the ice-water mixture to melt the ice.  

\( c_V = 0.633 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)  

\( c_p = R + c_V = 166.25 \, \text{J/kg·K} + 633 \, \text{J/kg·K} = 799.25 \, \text{J/kg·K} = 0.79925 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)
