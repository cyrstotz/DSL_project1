A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the y-axis labeled in bar and temperature (T) on the x-axis labeled in Kelvin (K). The graph includes the following features:  
- A curve labeled "Isotherme Expansion" (Isothermal Expansion).  
- A point labeled "Tripelpunkt" (Triple Point).  
- Regions labeled "Fest" (Solid), "Flüssig" (Liquid), and "Flüssig Gas" (Liquid Gas).  
- A line labeled "Isobare Abkühlung" (Isobaric Cooling).  
- A temperature difference labeled "ΔT = 10K".  
- A pressure value labeled "0.5 bar".
