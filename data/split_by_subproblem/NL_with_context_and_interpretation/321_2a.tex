A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "S in kJ/kgÂ·K" and the y-axis labeled as "T in K". The graph represents a T-s diagram with several points labeled:  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 2 is higher up and to the right of Point 1.  
- Point 3 is above Point 2.  
- Point 5 is to the right of Point 3.  
- Point 6 is below Point 5 and to the right of Point 1.  
- Point \( P_0 \) is at the bottom right.  
Arrows indicate transitions between the points, showing the process flow.
