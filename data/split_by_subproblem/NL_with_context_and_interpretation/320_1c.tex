Diagram: A reactor with heat transfer labeled as "cooling jacket."  

Entropy balance:  
0 equals Q out divided by T reactor minus Q out divided by T coolant plus S dot production.  

S dot production equals Q out divided by T reactor minus Q out divided by T coolant.  
S dot production equals 65 kilowatts divided by 298 kelvin minus 65 kilowatts divided by 373.15 kelvin.  
S dot production equals 0.046 kilowatts per kelvin.
