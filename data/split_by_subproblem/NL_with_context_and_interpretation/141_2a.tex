A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]".  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]".  

The diagram includes several curves and points:  
- Point 1 is marked on the lower curve.  
- Point 2 is marked higher up on the same curve.  
- Point 3 is marked on a separate curve above Point 2.  
- Point 4 is marked on another curve to the right of Point 3.  

Two isobars are labeled:  
- "0.191 bar" near the lower curve.  
- "0.5 bar" near the upper curve.  

A value "0.16" is written near Point 1.

A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states. The diagram includes the following:  
- States labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Isobars are shown as curved lines.  
- Axes are labeled: entropy (S) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kg·K) on the x-axis, and temperature (T) in Kelvin (K) on the y-axis.  
- The process path is marked with arrows connecting the states.  

Below the diagram, the following notes are written:  
- "Main isobar lies outside the diagram in the gas phase."  
- "Diagram on the other side."
