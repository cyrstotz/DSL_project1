Stationary flow process  

Zero equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy two minus enthalpy three) plus heat flow rate.  

Mass flow rate equals negative heat flow rate divided by (enthalpy two minus enthalpy three).  

Entropy two equals entropy three.  

Pressure three equals eight bar.  

Vapor quality two equals one.  

Pressure two equals pressure four.  

Temperature two equals interior temperature minus six Kelvin.
