A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis. The graph includes the following annotations:  
- A curve labeled "isobar" with points marked as 1, 2, and 3.  
- Point 1 is labeled "Flüssig" (liquid).  
- Point 2 is labeled "Gas" (gas).  
- Point 3 is labeled "Gas flüssig" (gas-liquid).  
- A horizontal line labeled "isotherm" connects points 2 and 3.  
- The curve intersects a point labeled "T_tripel" (triple point).
