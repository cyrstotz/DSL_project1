A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as 'T (K)' for temperature.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as 'S' with units 'kJ/kgK'.  

The diagram shows a process with six states labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- State 1 connects to state 2 with a curve.  
- State 2 connects to state 3 with a steep upward line.  
- State 3 connects to state 4 with a downward curve.  
- State 4 connects to state 5 with a jagged line.  
- State 5 connects to state 6 with a curve.
