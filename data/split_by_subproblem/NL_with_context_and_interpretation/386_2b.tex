Energy balance for the entire turbine:  
Q = m dot times (h2 minus h1) minus (w out minus w b)  

Energy balance for the nozzle:  
Q = m dot times (h5 minus h6 plus w6 squared minus w5 squared divided by 2) plus Q dot times (adiabatic reversible)  

Entropy balance:  
Q = m dot times (s5 minus s6) divided by T  

s5 minus s6 = cp times ln(T5 divided by T6) minus R times ln(p5 divided by p6) = 0  

ln(T5 divided by T6) = R divided by cp times ln(p5 divided by p6)  

T6 = 328.675 K  

h5 minus h6 = cp times (T5 minus T6) = 109.998 kJ/kg  

w6 squared = 2 times (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared) = 507.29 meters squared per second squared
