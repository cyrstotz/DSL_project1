The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) equals the temperature of the ice-water mixture \( T_{EW} \), which is 0 degrees Celsius. Since \( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \), there is still ice present, and the system remains at equilibrium.  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) is calculated as:  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 740 - 744 \, \text{Pa} \approx 744 \, \text{bar} \).  
Since the forces from inside and outside are equal, this corresponds to an isobaric expansion.
