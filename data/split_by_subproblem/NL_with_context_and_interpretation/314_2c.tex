Delta ex subscript str, 0c equals m subscript gas multiplied by (h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2).  

Delta ex subscript str, 0c equals m subscript gas multiplied by (c subscript p multiplied by (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript 0 multiplied by c subscript p multiplied by ln (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0)) plus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2.  

m subscript gas equals 15,100 cubic meters per second divided by 200 meters per second.
