Two diagrams are drawn on the page, both labeled as part of Task 2a.  

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The diagram is a T-s (temperature-entropy) graph.  
   - The x-axis is labeled with entropy units: `[kJ/kg·K]`.  
   - The y-axis is labeled with temperature: `T [K]`.  
   - Several points are marked and connected with arrows, indicating the process flow:  
     - Point `0` is at the origin.  
     - Point `1` is connected to `0` with an arrow labeled `isentropic`.  
     - Point `2` is connected to `1` with an upward arrow.  
     - Point `3` is connected to `2` with an arrow labeled `isobaric`.  
     - Point `4` is connected to `3` with a downward arrow labeled `isentropic`.  
     - Point `5` is connected to `4` with an upward arrow labeled `isobaric`.  
     - Point `6` is connected to `5` with a downward arrow labeled `isentropic`.  

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - The diagram is another T-s graph.  
   - The x-axis is labeled with entropy units: `[kJ/kg·K]`.  
   - The y-axis is labeled with temperature: `T [K]`.  
   - Several points are marked and connected with arrows, indicating the process flow:  
     - Point `0` is at the origin.  
     - Point `1` is connected to `0` with an arrow labeled `isentropic`.  
     - Point `2` is connected to `1` with an upward arrow.  
     - Point `3` is connected to `2` with an arrow labeled `isobaric`.  
     - Point `4` is connected to `3` with a downward arrow labeled `isentropic`.  
     - Point `5` is connected to `4` with an upward arrow labeled `isobaric`.  
     - Point `6` is connected to `5` with a downward arrow labeled `isentropic`.  

Both diagrams visually represent the thermodynamic processes described in Task 2.
