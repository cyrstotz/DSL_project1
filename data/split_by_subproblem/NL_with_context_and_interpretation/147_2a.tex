A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  

The diagram shows a process with six states labeled 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- States 0 to 2 are connected by an upward curve.  
- States 2 to 3 are connected by a steep upward curve labeled 'isobar'.  
- States 3 to 4 are connected by a downward curve.  
- States 4 to 5 are connected by a steep downward curve labeled 'isobar'.  
- States 5 to 6 are connected by a downward curve.  
- States 6 to 0 are connected by a horizontal line labeled 'isobar'.  

Additional labels:  
- \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- \( p_6 = p_0 - 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).
