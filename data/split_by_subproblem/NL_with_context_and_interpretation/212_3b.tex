\( p_0 = 1.5 \, \text{bar}, \, m_g = 3.6 \, \text{g} \)  

\( p \cdot V = m \cdot R \cdot T \)  

\( p_2 = p_1 \) â†’ The pressure must remain constant because the system is in equilibrium, and the weight of the piston does not change after the air pressure adjusts.  

\( T = \frac{p \cdot V}{m \cdot R} \)  

The temperature remains constant.
