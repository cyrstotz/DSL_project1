A diagram is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled regions:  
- "Fest" (solid)  
- "Fl√ºssig" (liquid)  
- "Gas" (gas)  
- "isotherm" (isothermal)  
- "isobar" (isobaric)  
The triple point is marked at the intersection of the three phase regions.
