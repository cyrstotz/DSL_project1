Because \( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \) and \( T \) remain in the entire mixture, \( T_{12} = 0^\circ \text{C} \) must be at constant \( 1.14 \, \text{bar} \).  

In the two-phase region, \( p = \text{const} = 1.14 \, \text{bar} \), the temperature is given here as \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) according to the table.  

The pressure also remains constant because \( p_{amb} \) and \( m_K \) are constant.
