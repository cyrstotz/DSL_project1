A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T [K]" for temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" for entropy.  

The diagram includes six states connected by arrows:  
- State 1 transitions to State 2.  
- State 2 transitions to State 3.  
- State 3 transitions to State 4.  
- State 4 transitions to State 5.  
- State 5 transitions to State 6.  

The isobars are labeled:  
- "0.5 bar" near State 5 and State 6.  
- "0.191 bar" near State 1.
