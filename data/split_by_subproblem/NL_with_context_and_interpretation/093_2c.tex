Specific flow exergy balance:  
Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy six minus enthalpy zero minus temperature zero multiplied by (entropy six minus entropy zero)) plus heat flow KF plus summation of \( \xi \) multiplied by temperature zero divided by temperature i multiplied by heat flow i minus exergy loss.  

Exist (FS):  
Exergy equals enthalpy six minus enthalpy zero minus temperature zero multiplied by (entropy six minus entropy zero) plus kinetic energy plus potential energy.  

Exergy zero minus exergy zero equals enthalpy six minus enthalpy zero minus temperature zero multiplied by (entropy six minus entropy zero) plus one-half multiplied by (velocity six squared minus velocity zero squared).
