Delta exergy specific equals h six minus h zero minus T zero multiplied by (s six minus s zero) plus w six squared divided by two minus w zero squared divided by two.  
This equals c p multiplied by (T six minus T zero) minus T zero multiplied by (c p multiplied by ln(T six divided by T zero) minus R multiplied by ln(p six divided by p zero)) plus w six squared divided by two minus w zero squared divided by two.  
This equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by (328.07 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin) minus 243.15 Kelvin multiplied by (1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by ln(328.07 divided by 243.15) minus 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by ln(0.5 divided by 0.191)) plus (220 meters per second squared minus 56.72 meters per second squared) divided by two.  
This equals 12.16 kilojoules plus 128.55 kilojoules minus 24.26 kilojoules.  
This equals 116.6 kilojoules.
