w_6 equals 510 meters per second  
T_6 equals 390 Kelvin  

Delta h_6 minus h_0 equals T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0) plus one-half w_6 squared minus one-half w_0 squared  

h_6 minus h_0 equals c_p multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) equals 372.22 kilojoules per kilogram  

s_6 minus s_0 equals c_p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p_6 divided by p_0) equals 5.867 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin
