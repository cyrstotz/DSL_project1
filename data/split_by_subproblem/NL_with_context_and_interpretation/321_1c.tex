Entropy production:  
Entropy production equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between entropy out and entropy in, minus heat flow divided by reactor temperature, plus heat flow out divided by coolant temperature.  

Equals 0.3 kilograms per second multiplied by the difference between 1.3064 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and 0.9564 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, minus 100 kilowatts divided by 373.15 Kelvin, plus 62.182 kilowatts divided by 295 Kelvin.  

Equals 0.0694 kilojoules per Kelvin.
