O equals m multiplied by the difference between S_ein and S_aus, plus negative Q_K divided by T, plus Q_R divided by T, plus S_ev2.

Internal energy of the gas:  

Delta U equals m times u two minus m times u one.  
This equals m times c subscript v times (T two minus T one).  
This equals 0.002993 kilograms times 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times [(0.003 times 273.15 minus (500 plus 273.15 Kelvin))].  
This equals negative 0.927 joules.  

W subscript u,12 equals m times integral from one to two of p times d v.  
n equals c subscript p divided by c subscript v equals (R plus c subscript v) divided by c subscript v.  
This equals 1.263.  

W subscript u,12 equals m times integral from one to two of R times (T two minus T one) divided by (n minus one).  
This equals 0.926 joules.
