c) Using entropy balance, we have:  
Sum of Q divided by T plus S erz equals Sum of m times (s out minus s in).  

This implies S erz equals Q out divided by T minus m times (s out minus s in).  

The values s in and s out can also be interpolated from Table A-2:  
s in equals x D times s f (T equals 70) plus (1 minus x D) times s f (T equals 70) equals 0.9889.  
s out equals x D times s g (T equals 100) plus (1 minus x D) times s f (T equals 100) equals 1.37319.  

Thus, S erz equals negative 62.299 divided by 288 plus 0.3 times (1.37319 minus 0.9889) approximately equals 211.18 kilojoules per kilogram.
