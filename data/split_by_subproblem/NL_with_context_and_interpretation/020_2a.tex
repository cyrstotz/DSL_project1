A graph is drawn with the title "T-s Diagram". The x-axis is labeled as 'S (kJ/kgÂ·K)' and the y-axis is labeled as 'T (K)'. The graph shows a series of points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, connected by curves. The transitions between points are labeled as follows:  
- Between 0 and 1: "Pre-compressor".  
- Between 1 and 2: "isentropic".  
- Between 2 and 3: "isentropic".  
- Between 3 and 5: "isobaric".  
- Between 5 and 6: "isentropic".
