Isothermal system:  
ΔE = ΣĖ_in (h_i + w_i squared / 2) + Q̇_B  
= 0, since the system is in equilibrium at the beginning and end.  

0 = ṁ (h_e - h_a - w_e squared / 2 - w_a squared / 2 + Q̇_B)  
0 = ṁ (h_e - h_a - w_e squared / 2 - 200 squared / 2) + Q̇_B  

∫ (Q̇_B / ṁ (h_e - h_a) - 200 squared) = w_a

e_x divided by m_gas equals e_x, mech divided by m_gas minus T_0 multiplied by S_erz divided by m_gas.
