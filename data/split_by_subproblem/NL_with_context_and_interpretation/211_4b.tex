System around the compressor:  
The equation is written as:  
Q equals m-dot multiplied by (h2 minus h3) minus W-dot.  

The mass flow rate m-dot is calculated as:  
m-dot equals W-dot divided by (h2 minus h3).  

It is noted that the process is adiabatic.  

Values are provided:  
h1 equals h4 equals 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.  
h2 is calculated as:  
Ti equals 10 degrees Celsius equals 283.15 Kelvin.  
Tv equals 4 degrees Celsius equals 277.15 Kelvin.  
h2 equals 249.53 kilojoules per kilogram.
