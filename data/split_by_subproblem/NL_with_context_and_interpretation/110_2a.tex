A diagram is drawn representing a T-s diagram with labeled isobars and processes.  
- The vertical axis is labeled as temperature (T).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as entropy (s).  
- The diagram includes points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Processes are marked as isobaric, adiabatic, and isentropic.  
- Pressure levels are labeled as \( p_0 = p_6 \), \( p_4 = p_5 \), and \( p_2 = p_3 \).
