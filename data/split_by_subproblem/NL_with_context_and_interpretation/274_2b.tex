w_6, T_6  
S to 6: reversible adiabatic  
Equation for T_6:  
T_6 divided by T_S equals (p_6 divided by p_S) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  
T_6 equals T_S multiplied by (p_0 divided by p_S) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  
T_6 equals 288.15 K multiplied by (0.5 divided by 0.191) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4).  
T_6 equals 328.07 K.  

Equation for w_6:  
dE divided by dt equals the sum of m-dot multiplied by (h plus ke) plus zG minus zW.  
m-dot multiplied by (UG minus U0) equals m-dot multiplied by (w_0 squared divided by 2 minus w_6 squared divided by 2).  
2 multiplied by c_V multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) equals w_0 squared minus w_6 squared divided by 2.  
w_6 squared equals w_0 squared plus 2 multiplied by c_V multiplied by (T_0 minus T_6).  

c_V equals c_p divided by k, which equals 0.7186.  
w_6 equals 199.85 m/s.

Energy balance equation:  
\( \Delta E = m_{eq2} - m_{u1} + \Delta KE + \Delta PE \)  

\( \dot{m} c_p (u_2 - u_1) = \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} \)  

\( w_6^2 = 2 \dot{m} c_p (u_2) \)  

\( 0 = \dot{m} (h_0 - h_6) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} - \frac{w_0^2}{2} + T_0 \dot{S} \dot{W} \)  

\( \dot{Q}_B = \dot{m} (h_0 - h_6) + \frac{w_6^2}{2} \)  

\( w_6^2 = 2 \frac{\dot{Q}_B}{\dot{m}} + 2 (h_0 - h_6) + w_0^2 \)  

\( w_6^2 = 2 \frac{\dot{Q}_B}{\dot{m}} + 2 c_p (T_0 - T_6) + w_0^2 \)
