A graph is drawn with entropy (S) labeled on the x-axis in units of kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K) and temperature (T) labeled on the y-axis in units of Kelvin (K). The graph shows a curve starting from a point near the origin and rising steeply, then leveling off slightly before continuing upward. The curve is drawn in blue.
