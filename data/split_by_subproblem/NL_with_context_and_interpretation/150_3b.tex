O equals cG times hG minus hEW.  

pg,2 equals pg,1 equals 1.4 bar, because the weight (CFg) remains constant and exerts pressure.  

T2 equals TEW,1 equals 0 degrees Celsius, because the heat capacity and mass of water are significantly larger than the enthalpy of fusion.  

There is still ice present, so T2EW must equal T1EW.
