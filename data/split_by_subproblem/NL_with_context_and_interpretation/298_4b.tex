The mass flow rate of the refrigerant in the cooling cycle is discussed:  
- \( W_L = 28 \, \text{W} \) or the heat flow removed is given as 85 J per second.  
- \( ZSU: \) fully condensed, \( p = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The transition \( 1 \to 2 \) is described as adiabatic compression.  
- The equation \( \dot{m}_{R134a} = \frac{-Q_{as}}{h_2 - h_1} \) is written, where \( h_2 \) and \( h_1 \) are enthalpies.  
- Additional enthalpy values are noted:  
  \( h_3 = h(8 \, \text{bar}) \),  
  \( h_4 = h(\text{s√§tt. fl., 8 \, \text{bar}}) \).  
- The pressure difference \( p_3 - p_1 \) is mentioned as influencing the cycle.
