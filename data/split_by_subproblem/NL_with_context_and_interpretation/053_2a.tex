A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states. The diagram includes the following:  
- State 0 at 0.191 bar and -30Â°C.  
- State 2 labeled as "P2".  
- State 3 labeled as "P2".  
- State 4 labeled as "P2".  
- State 5 at 0.5 bar and 481.8 K.  
- State 6 at 0.191 bar.  
The diagram shows reversible and isobaric processes, with arrows indicating transitions between states.
