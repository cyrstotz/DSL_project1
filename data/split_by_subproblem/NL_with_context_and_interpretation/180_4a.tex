A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled regions:  
- "fl√ºssig" (liquid) on the left side.  
- "2-phasen" (two-phase) in the middle.  
- "subl" (sublimation) and "triple" (triple point) near the intersection of curves.  
The curves represent phase boundaries, with arrows indicating transitions.
