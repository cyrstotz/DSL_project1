The equation for \( T_6 \) is written as:  
\( T_6 = T_5 \cdot \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \).  

Substituting values:  
\( T_6 = 431.9 \cdot \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} \).  

The result is \( T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K} \).  

Additional equations and derivations are present but partially crossed out or unclear.  
- \( w_6^2 = 2 \cdot \dot{Q}_{\text{add}} \cdot \left( h_5 - h_c \right) + w_5^2 \).  
- Other terms include \( \frac{w_5^2 - w_c^2}{2} \) and \( \dot{Q}_{\text{add}} \).
