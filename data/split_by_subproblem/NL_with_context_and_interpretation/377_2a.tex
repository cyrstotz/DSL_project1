A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K) and the y-axis labeled as temperature (T) in Kelvin (K). The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Point 0 is at the origin, labeled with \( p_0 \).  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 via an isentrope (vertical line).  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 via an isobar labeled \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  
- Point 3 is connected to point 4 via another isobar.  
- Point 5 is connected to point 6 via an isentrope.  
- Point 6 is labeled \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
The graph includes annotations for "isentropic," "isobaric," and "polytropic" processes.
