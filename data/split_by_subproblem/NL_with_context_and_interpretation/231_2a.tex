The diagram is a T-s graph with entropy (s) on the x-axis labeled in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kg·K) and temperature (T) on the y-axis labeled in Kelvin (K). The graph shows the process of a jet engine with labeled regions:  
- "Verdichter" (compressor) with an upward curve.  
- "Isobare Wärmezufuhr" (isobaric heat addition) with a horizontal line.  
- "Turbine" (turbine) with a downward curve.  
- "T-const" (constant temperature) is marked at the bottom.  
Two isobars are labeled as P1 and P2, with P2 being higher than P1.
