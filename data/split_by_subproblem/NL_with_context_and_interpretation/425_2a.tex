A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points and processes:  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]' (temperature).  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]' (entropy).  
- The diagram includes points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Isobars are marked, such as \( p_3 = p_2 \) and \( p_1 = p_4 = p_5 \).  
- The process between points 5 and 6 is labeled as 'isentrop'.  
- The region between points 3 and 4 is shaded.
