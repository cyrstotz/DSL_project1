A graph is drawn with pressure (p in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points 1, 2, 3, and 4, representing different states in the freeze-drying process. There is a shaded region labeled "II" and another region labeled "I". The curve transitions between these states, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
