A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p(N/m²)" and the x-axis labeled as "T(K)." The graph represents a phase diagram with a curve showing phase transitions. Points are marked along the curve, including a peak labeled "i." The curve starts low, rises to the peak, and then descends.

A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 'T (K)' and the y-axis labeled as 'p (N/m²)'. The graph shows curves representing phase regions, including transitions between solid, liquid, and gas phases. The curves are qualitatively labeled, with arrows indicating directions of change.
