The diagram is a T-s graph (temperature versus entropy) with labeled points and processes.  

- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" for temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "S [kJ/kg·K]" for entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.  

The graph includes the following points and processes:  
- Point 0 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 is slightly higher than point 0.  
- Point 2 is higher than point 1 and connected by a steep curve.  
- Point 3 is at the peak and connected to point 2 by a horizontal line.  
- Point 4 is lower than point 3 and connected by a downward sloping line labeled "Adiab non-rev" (adiabatic non-reversible).  
- Point 5 is connected to point 4 by a horizontal line.  
- Point 6 is at the bottom right and connected to point 5 by a steep curve.  

The isobars are labeled as:  
- p0 (lowest pressure)  
- p1  
- p2  

Additional notes:  
- "p5 = p1 = p4"  
- Processes are described as follows:  
  - 0 to 1: η < 1  
  - 1 to 2: isentropic  
  - 2 to 3: isobaric  
  - 3 to 4: adiabatic non-reversible  
  - 4 to 5: isobaric  
  - 5 to 6: isentropic
