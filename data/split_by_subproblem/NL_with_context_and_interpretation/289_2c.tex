Additional calculations are shown:  
- \( w_6^2 / 2 = h_5 - h_6 + w_5^2 / 2 - w_6^2 / 2 \)  
- \( w_6^2 / 2 = h_5 - h_6 + w_5^2 / 2 \)  
- \( w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot c_p \cdot (T_5 - T_6) + w_5^2} \)  
- \( w_6 = 507.284 m/sec \)  

The final result for \( w_6 \) is underlined.

Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream at state 6 minus exergy stream at state 0.  

Delta exergy stream equals [enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus temperature at state 0 multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0) plus delta kinetic energy].  

Enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 equals specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at state 6 minus temperature at state 0).  

Entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0 equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 0) minus gas constant multiplied by the natural logarithm of (pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at state 0).  

Delta kinetic energy equals velocity at state 6 squared minus velocity at state 0 squared divided by 2.  

Gas constant equals universal gas constant divided by molar mass.  

Universal gas constant equals 8.314 joules per mole per kelvin.  

Molar mass equals 28.57 kilograms per kilomole.  

Delta exergy stream equals [specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at state 6 minus temperature at state 0) minus temperature at state 0 multiplied by (specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 0) minus gas constant multiplied by the natural logarithm of (pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at state 0)) plus (velocity at state 6 squared minus velocity at state 0 squared divided by 2)].  

Delta exergy stream equals approximately 125.47773 kilojoules per kilogram.
