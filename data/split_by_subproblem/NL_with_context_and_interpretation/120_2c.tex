Delta exergy equals exergy at state 6 minus exergy at state 0.  

Delta exergy equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus ambient temperature multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0)) plus kinetic energy at state 6 minus kinetic energy at state 0.  

Delta exergy equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus ambient temperature multiplied by entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0) minus enthalpy at state 1 plus ambient temperature multiplied by entropy at state 0 minus entropy at state 6.  

Delta exergy equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 1 minus ambient temperature multiplied by entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 1) plus kinetic energy at state 6 minus kinetic energy at state 1.  

Delta exergy equals mass flow rate multiplied by (specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at state 6 minus temperature at state 1) minus ambient temperature multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 1)) minus gas constant multiplied by the natural logarithm of (pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at state 1) plus kinetic energy at state 6 minus kinetic energy at state 1.  

Delta exergy mass-specific equals delta exergy divided by mass flow rate.  

Delta exergy equals specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at state 6 minus temperature at state 0) minus ambient temperature multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0) minus specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 0).  

Delta exergy equals 1.006 multiplied by (340 Kelvin minus 253.15 Kelvin) minus (301273.5) minus 1.006 multiplied by the natural logarithm of (340 Kelvin divided by 253.15 Kelvin).  

Plus (700 squared divided by 2) minus (510 squared divided by 2).  

Delta exergy equals negative 110034.7796 joules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy equals negative 110.034 kilojoules per kilogram.
