Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The graph includes labeled points: `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.  
   - A cycle is drawn connecting these points, labeled as "i".  
   - The graph includes phase regions: "gas" and "flüssig" (liquid).  

2. The second diagram is another p-T graph.  
   - It includes phase regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous).  
   - A cycle is drawn connecting points `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.  
   - Sublimation is indicated between points `1` and `2`.
