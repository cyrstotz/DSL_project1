Delta E equals Delta m12 multiplied by u plus Q out.  

m total 2 minus m total 1 multiplied by u equals Q out.  

(m total 2 minus m total 1) multiplied by (u2 plus u1) equals Q out.  

Delta m12 multiplied by (u2 plus u1) equals Q out.  

Therefore, Delta m12 equals Q out divided by (u2 plus u1) equals 35 megajoules divided by 399.37.  

u2 equals u saturated water at 70 degrees Celsius:  
292.95 plus 0.005 multiplied by (2496.6 minus 292.95) equals 303.83.  

u1 equals u saturated water at 20 degrees Celsius:  
83.95 plus 0.005 multiplied by (2492.9 minus 83.95) equals 95.5.
