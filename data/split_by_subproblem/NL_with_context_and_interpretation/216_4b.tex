The heading reads: "In adiabatic compression process 2-3".  

An equation is written:  
Q equals m multiplied by (h e minus h a) plus k e plus v e squared divided by 2 plus Q dot minus W.  

Another equation is written:  
W equals m multiplied by (h e minus h a) equals m multiplied by (h 2 minus h 3).  

A formula for mass flow rate is written:  
m equals W divided by (h a minus h 3).  

Two placeholders are written:  
h 2 equals  
h 3 equals
