First law of thermodynamics applied to the gas:  
Change in internal energy (\( \Delta U_{12} \)) equals heat transfer (\( Q_{12} \)) minus work (\( W_{12} \)):  
\( \Delta U_{12} = Q_{12} - W_{12} \)  

Using the equation:  
\( m_g c_V (T_{2g} - T_{1g}) = Q_{12} - W_{12} \)  

Work (\( W_{12} \)) is calculated as:  
\( W_{12} = \int_{1}^{2} p \, dV \)  
\( W_{12} = R(T_{2g} - T_{1g}) \)  
\( W_{12} = -83.14 \, \text{kJ} \)  

Substituting into the heat transfer equation:  
\( Q_{12} = m_g c_V (T_{2g} - T_{1g}) - 83.14 \, \text{kJ} \)  
\( Q_{12} = -82 \, \text{kJ} \)
