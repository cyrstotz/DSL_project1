If \( x_{\text{Ice},2} > 0 \), this means \( T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

Since the EW and the gas are in thermodynamic equilibrium, \( T_{g,2} \) is also \( 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

\( p_{g,2} \) can also be found using \( pV = mRT \), but it is not needed.

\( p_{g,2} = \frac{m_g \cdot R \cdot T_{g,2}}{V} \)  

Since the external pressure remains the same (\( \Delta m = 0 \)):  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.1 \, \text{bar} \)
