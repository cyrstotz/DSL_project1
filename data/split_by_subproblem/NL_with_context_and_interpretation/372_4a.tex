Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled "p-T-Diagram." It shows a curve with labeled points:  
   - Point 21 is marked.  
   - Point 23 is marked.  
   - Point 5-5 is marked.  
   - The curve transitions through regions labeled "Flüssig" (Liquid) and "Nassdampf" (Wet Steam).  

2. The second diagram is also labeled "p-T-Diagram." It shows a curve with labeled points:  
   - Point 21 is marked.  
   - Point 22 is marked.  
   - Point 3 is marked.  
   - Point 4 is marked.  
   - The curve transitions through regions labeled "Flüssig" (Liquid) and "Nassdampf" (Wet Steam).
