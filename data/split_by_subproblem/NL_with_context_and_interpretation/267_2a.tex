A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The diagram includes isobars labeled as \( p = p_0 \), \( p = p_5 \), and \( p = p_2 \). A bypass is indicated between points 4 and 5. The x-axis is labeled \( s \, [\text{kJ/kgK}] \), and the y-axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \).
