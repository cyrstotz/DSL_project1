Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with labeled regions for "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous). The triple point is marked, and arrows indicate transitions between states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
2. The second diagram is another p-T graph with similar regions labeled "fest," "flüssig," and "gasförmig." The triple point is marked, and arrows show transitions between states labeled 2 and 3.
