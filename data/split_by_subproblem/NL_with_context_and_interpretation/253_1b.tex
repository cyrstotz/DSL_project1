Thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant stream:  

Equation:  
Mean temperature equals heat flow out divided by (entropy out minus entropy in).  

Entropy difference:  
Mean temperature equals heat flow out divided by mass flow rate of coolant times heat capacity of coolant times natural logarithm of (temperature out divided by temperature in).

Additional derivation for the first law of thermodynamics applied to the cooling jacket:  

Equation:  
Heat flow out equals mass flow rate of coolant times (enthalpy in minus enthalpy out).  

Simplified:  
Heat flow out equals negative heat capacity of coolant times (temperature in minus temperature out) times mass flow rate of coolant.  

Result:  
Negative heat flow out divided by heat capacity of coolant equals temperature difference divided by mass flow rate of coolant.

Thermodynamic mean temperature \( T \):  
T equals the difference between \( T_{in} \) and \( T_{out} \) divided by the natural logarithm of \( T_{out} \) over \( T_{in} \).  
T equals 293.12 Kelvin.
