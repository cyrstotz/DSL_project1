A second p-T diagram is drawn with labeled points and regions. The diagram includes:  
- A curve labeled "Dampf" (vapor).  
- The x-axis labeled as "T (°C)" and the y-axis as "p (bar)".  
- Three points labeled "1", "2", and "3".  
- A horizontal line connecting points "1" and "2", and another horizontal line connecting points "2" and "3".  
- The region above the curve is labeled "Flüssig" (liquid), and the region below the curve is labeled "Dampf" (vapor).
