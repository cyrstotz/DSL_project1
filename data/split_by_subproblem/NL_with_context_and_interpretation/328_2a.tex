Three diagrams are drawn on the page:

1. **Top Diagram**:  
   - The graph is labeled with "2" at the top left corner.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "s" (entropy).  
   - A curve is drawn, starting at a high temperature, increasing to a peak, and then decreasing.  
   - The x-axis includes the label "kJ/kg" near the end.

2. **Middle Diagram**:  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
   - The x-axis is unlabeled.  
   - Four points are marked: "1", "2", "3", and "4".  
   - The graph shows a step-like progression:  
     - From point "1" to "2", there is a vertical line.  
     - From point "2" to "3", there is a horizontal line.  
     - From point "3" to "4", there is a downward-sloping line.

3. **Bottom Diagram**:  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature) with "inlet" written next to it.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "s" (entropy).  
   - The graph includes six points labeled "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", and "6".  
   - The progression is as follows:  
     - From point "1" to "2", there is a vertical line labeled "isobar".  
     - From point "2" to "3", there is a horizontal line.  
     - From point "3" to "4", there is a downward-sloping curve.  
     - From point "4" to "5", there is another downward-sloping curve.  
     - From point "5" to "6", there is a horizontal line.  
   - The label "T_5 = 431.94 K" is written near the y-axis.  
   - The x-axis includes the label "kJ/kg" near the end.
