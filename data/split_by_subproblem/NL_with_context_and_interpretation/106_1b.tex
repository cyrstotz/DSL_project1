Zero equals mass flow rate of coolant multiplied by the specific entropy difference (s_KF,e minus s_KF,a) plus heat flow rate divided by thermodynamic mean temperature (Q̇_out divided by T̄_KF) plus entropy production (Ṡ_erz).  
s_KF,e minus s_KF,a equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of T_KF,e divided by T_KF,a.  
T̄_KF equals negative mass flow rate of coolant multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of T_KF,e divided by T_KF,a divided by Q̇_out.
