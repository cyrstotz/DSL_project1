Two diagrams are drawn to represent the freeze-drying process in a p-T diagram:  

1. **Diagram labeled "i":**  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "p" (pressure).  
   - A curve is drawn, representing the phase regions.  
   - Four states are marked:  
     - State 1 is at the lower left of the curve.  
     - State 2 is slightly higher on the curve.  
     - State 3 is at the top of the curve, labeled "adiabat reversible."  
     - State 4 is on the descending side of the curve, labeled "isobar."  
   - The region under the curve is labeled "NS."  

2. **Diagram labeled "ii":**  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "p" (pressure).  
   - A curve is drawn, representing the phase regions.  
   - State 2 is marked at the peak of the curve, labeled "isotherm" and "Triple point."  
   - The region under the curve is labeled "NS."
