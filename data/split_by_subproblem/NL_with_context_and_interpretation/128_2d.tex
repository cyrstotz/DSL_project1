Two mass flow rate equations are written:  
- ṁges = ṁM + ṁK  
- ṁM = 5.293 ṁK  
- ṁges = 6.293 ṁK

Exergy loss equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 0, minus the product of the surrounding temperature and the difference between entropy at state 6 and entropy at state 0, plus one-half multiplied by the difference in velocity squared between state 6 and state 0, plus the summation of one minus the ratio of surrounding temperature to thermodynamic mean temperature multiplied by heat flow, minus work flow.

Delta c_x,six equals one minus the ratio of surrounding temperature to thermodynamic mean temperature multiplied by q_B, which equals one minus the ratio of 293 Kelvin to 1289 Kelvin multiplied by 1195 kilojoules per kilogram, resulting in 269.72 kilojoules per kilogram.

Entropy production equals entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0 plus q_B divided by thermodynamic mean temperature minus one divided by mass flow rate multiplied by work flow.

Entropy at state 6 equals entropy at state 0 plus the integral from surrounding temperature to thermodynamic mean temperature of specific heat capacity divided by temperature minus the gas constant multiplied by the natural logarithm of the ratio of pressure at state 6 to pressure at state 0. The gas constant equals R divided by molar mass of air, which equals 28.973 kilograms per kilomole.

Exergy loss equals surrounding temperature multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of the ratio of temperature at state 6 to surrounding temperature minus the gas constant divided by molar mass multiplied by the natural logarithm of the ratio of pressure at state 6 to pressure at state 0 minus q_B divided by thermodynamic mean temperature.
