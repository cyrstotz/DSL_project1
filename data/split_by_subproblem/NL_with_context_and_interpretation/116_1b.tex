T_KF equals integral of dT divided by s_a minus s_e  

Entropy change: s_a minus s_e equals c_p times ln(T_a divided by T_e)  

Integral of dT equals q_rev equals h_out minus h_in (from the first law of thermodynamics)  
equals c_p times (T_a minus T_e)  

T_a equals 298.15 K  
T_e equals 288.15 K  

T_KF equals 293.12 K
