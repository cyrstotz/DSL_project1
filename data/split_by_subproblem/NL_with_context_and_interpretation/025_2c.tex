c) Entropy production:  
\( \dot{S}_{prod} = \dot{Q}_{out} \cdot \frac{1}{T_{coolant}} - \dot{Q}_{out} \cdot \frac{1}{T_{reactor}} \)  
\( \dot{S}_{prod} = \dot{Q}_{out} \cdot ( \frac{1}{T_{coolant}} - \frac{1}{T_{reactor}} ) \)

Qualitative determination of flow exergy:  

exergy flow = exergy flow at state 6 minus exergy flow at state 0  

exergy flow = (h_6 minus h_0) minus T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0)  

h_6 = h_5 plus w_6 squared divided by 2 minus w_5 squared divided by 2  

h_6 = h_5 plus (220 squared divided by 2 minus 200 squared divided by 2)  

h_6 = h_5 plus (48400 minus 40000) divided by 2  

h_6 = h_5 plus 4200  

h_6 = 599.01 plus 4.2  

h_6 = 603.21 kJ/kg  

s_6 = s_5  

exergy flow = (603.21 minus 599.01) minus (10 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0))  

exergy flow = 4.2 minus (10 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0))
