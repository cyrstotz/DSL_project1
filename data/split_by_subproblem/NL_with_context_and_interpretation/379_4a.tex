A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn with labeled phase regions.  
- The diagram includes a curve labeled "Triple Point" and "Critical Point."  
- The pressure axis ranges from 1 mbar to 8 bar, and the temperature axis ranges from -102°C to 20°C.  
- The region below the triple point is marked as "ii" (sublimation phase).  
- The temperature \( T_i \) is noted as \( T_i = -20^\circ C = 253.15 \, \text{K} \).
