A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 'S [kJ/kgÂ·K]'. The graph depicts a T-s diagram with several labeled points and processes:  
- Point 0 is at the origin.  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 with a vertical line labeled 'vertikal'.  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 with a curve labeled 'P2 = P3'.  
- Point 3 is connected to point 4 with a horizontal line labeled 'isobaren'.  
- Point 4 is connected to point 5 with a curve labeled 'P4 = Ps = P1 = 0.5 bar'.  
- Point 5 is connected to point 6 with a vertical line labeled 'P0 = P6 = 0.191 bar'.  
- The entropy values are labeled as 'S1 = S2' and 'S5 = S6'.
