Exergy loss equals T zero times entropy production.  

Q equals m times (S e minus S a) plus Q B divided by T B plus integral S e to z.  

S e to z divided by m equals S a minus S e minus Q B divided by T B equals integral from T two to T three of c p times T divided by T d T minus R times ln of p B divided by p two.  

Equals c p times ln of T three divided by T B minus Q B divided by T B equals minus 1295.81 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Exergy loss equals 243.13 Kelvin times minus 1295.81 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin equals minus 315076.20 kilojoules.
