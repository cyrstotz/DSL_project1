A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_5 \), and \( p_B \). The diagram shows the thermodynamic process with points labeled \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \). Arrows indicate the direction of the process between these points. The y-axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), and the x-axis is labeled \( s \, [kJ/kgÂ·K] \).
