\( x_{\text{Ice},2} > 0 \), \( T_{g,2} = ? \), \( p_{g,2} = ? \)  

Volumes 1 and 2 are constant, the gas does not expand into the surrounding area. The temperature remains constant, \( T_2 = T_1 \).  
The pressure is proportional to the volume because the membrane does not expand and it is a closed system.  

\( T_{g,2} \) is equal to \( T_{g,1} \) because the volume does not change.  
\( T_2 \) remains constant, \( p_{g,1} \) remains constant because the gas does not expand.
