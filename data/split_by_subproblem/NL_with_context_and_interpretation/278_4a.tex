The second diagram is a p-T diagram. The x-axis is labeled "T [K]" and the y-axis is labeled "p [bar]". The diagram includes a curved line labeled "fed" and annotations for different processes:  
- "isotherm" is written along a horizontal segment.  
- "flowing gas" is written near a vertical segment.  
- "isobar" is written along another horizontal segment.  

The diagram visually represents phase regions and transitions, but no further numerical values or detailed explanations are provided.
