Delta u equals Q twelve divided by m EW, which implies m EW multiplied by (u two minus u one) equals Q twelve.  

u two equals Q twelve divided by m EW plus u one, which equals negative 122.58 kilojoules per kilogram.  

u one equals u one at zero degrees Celsius plus x one multiplied by (u one gas minus u one fluid).  

This equals 333.458 plus 0.6 multiplied by (negative 0.045 minus 333.458).  

This equals negative 133.4102 kilojoules per kilogram.  

T EW two equals zero degrees Celsius.  

0.003 is less than x two.  

x two equals u two minus u two fluid divided by u two gas fluid minus u two fluid, which equals 0.632.
