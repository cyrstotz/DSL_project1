A graph is drawn with the temperature \( T \) in Kelvin on the y-axis and entropy \( s \) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the x-axis. The graph includes labeled isobars and processes:  
- Isobar at \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  
- Isobar at \( p_0 = p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  
- An isentropic (adiabatic and reversible) process is marked between states 5 and 6.  
- The temperature at the lower end of the graph is \( T = 243.15 \, \text{K} \).
