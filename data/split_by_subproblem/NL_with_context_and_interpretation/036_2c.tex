Delta exergy flow equals exergy at state 6 minus exergy at state 0.  
Delta exergy flow equals h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus kinetic energy change.  
Kinetic energy change equals (w subscript 6 squared minus w subscript 0 squared) divided by 2.  

h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 equals integral from T subscript 0 to T subscript 6 of c subscript p dT, which equals c subscript p multiplied by (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0), which equals c subscript p multiplied by (310 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin).  
c subscript p equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
Result equals 97.43 kilojoules per kilogram.  

s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0 equals integral from T subscript 0 to T subscript 6 of c subscript p divided by T dT minus R multiplied by ln(p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 0).  
Result equals ln(T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) multiplied by c subscript p minus R multiplied by ln(p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 0).  
Equals ln(310 Kelvin divided by 243.15 Kelvin) multiplied by 1.006 minus 0.287.  
Result equals 0.337 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Delta exergy flow equals 97.43 minus 243.15 multiplied by 0.337 plus (510 squared minus 200 squared) divided by 2.  
Result equals 110 megawatts (110.085 megawatts).
