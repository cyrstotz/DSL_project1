A graph is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The y-axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \).  
- The x-axis is labeled \( s \, [\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}] \).  

The graph includes curves labeled "ISOBARS" and points marked as follows:  
- Point 0 at \( T_0 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \).  
- Point 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are connected with arrows indicating transitions.  
- Isobars are labeled as "0.191 bar" and "1.03 bar".  
- Arrows indicate entropy changes and key transitions between states.  

The label "KENNZUSTAND" is written near the graph.
