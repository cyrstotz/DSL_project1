The following equations and notes are written:  
- "p0 = pC"  
- "stat. FP am Schnittkreuz: 0 = ṁ (h5 - h6) + Q̇ - Ẇ"  
- "Ẇ = ṁ (h5 - h6)"  
- "h5 (0.5 bar) 431.9 K = interpolieren für x1 = 430 K, x2 = 440 K, in TAB-A2Z"

Exergy flow equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 0, minus the product of the surrounding temperature and the difference between entropy at state 6 and entropy at state 0, plus one-half multiplied by the difference in velocity squared between state 6 and state 0.
