A table is provided with the following columns:  
- P (Pressure), T (Temperature), x (Vapor quality), and s (Entropy).  
The rows are filled as follows:  
1. P = 1 millibar, T = -16°C, x = blank, s = blank.  
2. P = 1 millibar, T = -16°C, x = 1, s = blank.  
3. P = 8 bar, T = blank, x = blank, s = blank.  
4. P = 8 bar, T = blank, x = 0, s = blank.  
Additional notes: Ti = 6K.
