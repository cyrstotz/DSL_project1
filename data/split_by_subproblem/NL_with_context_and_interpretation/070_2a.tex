Two diagrams are drawn, both labeled with axes and annotations.  

**Diagram 1:**  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'S' (entropy) with units '[kJ/kg·K]'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
- Several curves are drawn, representing isobars labeled as \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_7 \).  
- Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, connected by arrows indicating processes.  
- Processes are annotated:  
  - Between 0 and 1: 'adiabatic, reversible → isentropic'.  
  - Between 1 and 2: 'adiabatic, reversible → isentropic'.  
  - Between 2 and 3: 'adiabatic'.  
  - Between 3 and 5: 'isobar'.  
  - Between 5 and 6: 'adiabatic, reversible → isentropic'.  
- Temperature values are noted near point 5 as \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  

**Diagram 2:**  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'S' (entropy) with units '[kJ/kg·K]'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
- Several curves are drawn, representing isobars labeled as \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_7 \).  
- Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, connected by arrows indicating processes.  
- Processes are annotated:  
  - Between 0 and 1: 'adiabatic, reversible → isentropic'.  
  - Between 1 and 2: 'adiabatic, reversible → isentropic'.  
  - Between 2 and 3: 'adiabatic'.  
  - Between 3 and 5: 'isobar'.  
  - Between 5 and 6: 'adiabatic, reversible → isentropic'.  
- Temperature values are noted near point 5 as \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  
- A value is noted near the bottom left corner as \( 293.15 \).
