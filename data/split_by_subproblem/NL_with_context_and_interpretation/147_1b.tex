b) Thermodynamic mean temperature:  
Thermodynamic mean temperature equals integral from inlet to exit of temperature multiplied by differential entropy divided by the difference in entropy between inlet and exit.  

For ideal fluids:  
Thermodynamic mean temperature equals integral from inlet to exit of temperature multiplied by differential entropy.
