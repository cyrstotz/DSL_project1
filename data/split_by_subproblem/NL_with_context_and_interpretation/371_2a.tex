A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph depicts a qualitative T-s diagram with several points labeled as 2, 4, 5, and 6. The curve starts at point 2, rises to point 4, then descends to point 5, and finally rises again to point 6. Horizontal lines connect points 2 and 4, as well as points 5 and 6.
