Thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant:  
T KF equals integral from s a to s e of T d s divided by (s a minus s e).  
Equals q rev divided by (s a minus s e).  
Equals c p times (T KF out minus T KF in) divided by (s a minus s e).  
Equals c p times natural logarithm of (T KF out divided by T KF in).  

Result: T KF equals 233.12 Kelvin.
