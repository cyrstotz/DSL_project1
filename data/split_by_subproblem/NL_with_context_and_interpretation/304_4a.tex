A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled with values 1 and 10, while the horizontal axis is labeled with values -10, 0, and 10. A curve is plotted, starting from the lower left and rising steadily. A sharp vertical line is drawn near the middle of the curve.
