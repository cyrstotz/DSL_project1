A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The curve resembles a dome shape, with a peak labeled as \( T_c \).  

Below the graph, the following is written:  
\( T_i = -20^\circ C \)  

On the top right corner, the following values are written:  
\( 1 \, \text{mbar} = 0.001 \, \text{bar} \)  
\( 1 \, \text{mm} = 0.001 \)
