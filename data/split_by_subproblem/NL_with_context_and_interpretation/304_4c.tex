Mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 4 minus enthalpy at state 1) equals zero.  
This implies that the enthalpy at state 4 equals the enthalpy at state 1.  

Using the table A-11, the enthalpy at state 1 is determined to be approximately 93.42.  

The temperature at state 4 equals the temperature at state 1.
