Diagram description:  
A pressure-temperature (\( p \)-\( T \)) diagram is drawn.  
- The diagram includes labeled regions for gas, liquid, and solid phases.  
- Sublimation and evaporation lines are marked.  
- The triple point is indicated.  
- Axes are labeled as \( p \) in bar and \( T \) in Kelvin (\( K \)).
