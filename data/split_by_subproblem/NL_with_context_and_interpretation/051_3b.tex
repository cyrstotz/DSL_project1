As long as x sub Ice,2 is greater than 0, ice is present, and the temperature remains at 0 degrees Celsius because all added heat flows into the phase transition to water and does not result in a temperature change. Therefore, the temperature must remain at the melting point. T sub g,2 equals T sub EW,2 equals 0 degrees Celsius due to thermodynamic equilibrium.  

The pressure p sub g,2 remains the same as in state 1, so p sub g,2 equals p sub g,1 equals 1.91 bar. This is because neither the external pressure nor the mass (m sub K plus m sub EW) has changed.  

T sub g,2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.  
p sub g,2 equals 1.910 bar equals p sub g,1.
