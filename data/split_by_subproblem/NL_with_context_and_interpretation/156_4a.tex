Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (P-T) graph. It includes labeled regions for solid, liquid, and vapor phases. The triple point is marked as "Trippelpunkt." The graph shows a cycle with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected by arrows.  

2. The second diagram is a temperature-entropy (T-S) graph. It also shows the cycle with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected by arrows. The phase regions are labeled as solid, liquid, and liquid vapor.
