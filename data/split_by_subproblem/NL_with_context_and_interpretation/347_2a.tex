A T-s diagram is drawn with the following details:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s" (entropy) with units "[kJ/kg·K]".  
- Points labeled as "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", and "6" are marked along curves.  
- The curve from "0" to "1" is labeled with "η < 1".  
- The curve from "1" to "2" is labeled with "η = 1".  
- The curve from "2" to "3" is labeled with "η = 1".  
- The curve from "4" to "5" is labeled with "η = 5".  
- Dashed lines are drawn to indicate isobars.
