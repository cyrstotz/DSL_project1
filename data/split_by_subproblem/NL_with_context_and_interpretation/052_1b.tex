T KF equals integral from S a to S e of d S divided by S a minus S e.  
d S equals d Q divided by T.  

Integral from S a to S e of d S divided by S a minus S e equals q a minus q e divided by S a minus S e equals u a minus u e divided by S a minus S e.  

T KF equals integral of T a minus T e divided by ln of T a divided by T e.  

T KF equals 293.12 Kelvin.
