The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is given as:  
\( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},1} \)  
\( = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  

Explanation:  
- The ice-water mixture does not change its temperature due to the heat flow, as it is already in the solid-liquid equilibrium region.  
- This process is isothermal.  
- In equilibrium, the gas and ice have the same temperature.  

A scribbled-out diagram is present.  

The pressure \( p_{a,2} \) is stated as:  
\( p_{a,2} = p_{a,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \)  

Explanation:  
The pressure remains constant because the force equilibrium does not change, only heat was transferred (see Task 2).
