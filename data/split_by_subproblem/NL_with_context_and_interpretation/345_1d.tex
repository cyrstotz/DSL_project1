m2 equals m1 minus mD equals delta m12 plus 35 divided by (2506.5 multiplied by (T2 minus T1) plus 35 divided by T1).  
m1 equals 5755 kilograms.  
mD equals m multiplied by xD equals 0.3 multiplied by 0.005 equals 0.015 kilograms.  
delta m12 equals m1 minus mD minus m2 equals 830.6 kilograms.  
h2 equals 232.095 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table A-2).  
T1 equals 20 degrees Celsius.  
T2 equals 70 degrees Celsius.
