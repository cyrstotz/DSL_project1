Mean temperature of the coolant (T KF):  
Equation: Integral of T ds divided by s2 minus s1.  

Ideal liquid: constant pressure and constant Cp.  
Equation: h2 minus h1 divided by s2 minus s1 equals Cp multiplied by (T out minus T in) divided by log of T out divided by T in.  

Simplified:  
T KF equals (T out minus T in) divided by log of T out divided by T in.  

Calculation:  
T KF equals (298.75 Kelvin minus 288.75 Kelvin) divided by log of (298.75 Kelvin divided by 288.75 Kelvin), which equals 293.22 Kelvin.
