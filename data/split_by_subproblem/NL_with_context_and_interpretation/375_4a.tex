A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The curve represents the phase regions of the freeze-drying process. Points labeled '1', '3', and '2' are marked along the curve, with arrows indicating transitions between these states. The process is labeled as "adiabat."
