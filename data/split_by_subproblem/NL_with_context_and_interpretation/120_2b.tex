The following equations and calculations are written:  

System boundary for the entire system:  
0 = ṁ (he - hq + (we squared minus wa squared) divided by 2) + Q̇ minus Ẇ  

Simplified:  
0 = he minus hq + we squared minus wa squared divided by 2  

Further simplified:  
0 = h0 minus h6 + w0 squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2  

Rearranged:  
w6 squared = 2 (h0 minus h6) + w0 squared  

w6 squared = 2 · cp · (T1 minus T6) + w0 squared  

State SE = isentropic:  
p5 = 0.5 bar  
p6 = 0.15 bar  
T5 = 431.9 K  

Equation for temperature ratio:  
T6 divided by T5 = (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n  

n = 1.4  

Calculation:  
T6 = T5 · (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n  
T6 = 431.9 K · (0.15 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4  
T6 = 328.07 K  

Final velocity calculation:  
w6 = square root of (2 · 1.006 · ((-30 °C + 273.15 K) minus 328.07 K) + 200 meters per second squared)  

Result:  
w6 = 193.5 meters per second
