\( T_{g,2} \), \( p_{g,2} \):  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \), as the mass on the piston does not change.  
Volume \( EW \) does not change either. Gas compresses, resulting in higher pressure but higher temperature.  

\( T_{g,2} = \frac{p_{g,2} V_{g,2}}{m_g R} \)  

\( p V^n = p V^n \)  
\( \text{Sachor} = v^n \)  

\( V_2 = \frac{RT_g}{p} = 3.14 \times 10^{-3} \)
