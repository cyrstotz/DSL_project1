\( V_{g,2} < V_{g,1} \)  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \)  
\( PV = mRT \)  

\( p_{g} \) must remain equal because the load on the piston is equal. When \( p_{g,1} = p_{g,2} \), \( V_{g,2} < V_{g,1} \), \( T_{g,2} < T_{g,1} \), and \( T_{g,2} = T_{EW} \) because the gas is perfect.  

\( p_{g,2} = p_{g} = 1.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
\( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)
