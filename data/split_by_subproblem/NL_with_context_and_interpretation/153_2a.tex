A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph includes several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Isobars are marked: "isobare p2/p3", "isobare p5=p4", "isobare p0=p0".  
- Points are labeled: "0", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6".  
- A curve connects these points, showing transitions between states.  

Equations are written to the right of the graph:  
- \( \dot{m} = \frac{\dot{V}}{nRT} \)  
- \( T = \frac{\rho V^{\kappa}}{nR} \)
