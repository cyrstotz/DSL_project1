Delta exergy of the stream equals exergy at state 6 minus exergy at state 0.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus reference temperature multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0)) plus velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2 minus velocity at state 0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus reference temperature multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0)) plus velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2 minus velocity at state 0 squared divided by 2.  

Velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2 equals 350.04 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Enthalpy at state 0 equals enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 equals specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at state 6 minus temperature at state 0) equals 85.03 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Reference temperature equals 293.15 kelvin.  

Entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0 equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by reference temperature) minus pressure term (crossed out).  

Entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0 equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by reference temperature) equals 0.307 kilojoules per kilogram kelvin.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals mass flow rate multiplied by (specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at state 6 minus reference temperature) minus reference temperature multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by reference temperature) plus velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2 minus velocity at state 0 squared divided by 2).  

Delta exergy of the stream equals 56.25 multiplied by mass flow rate in kilojoules per kilogram.
