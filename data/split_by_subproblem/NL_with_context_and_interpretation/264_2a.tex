A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled "s [kJ/kgK]" (entropy).  
- The y-axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature).  

The diagram includes the following labeled processes:  
1. "Isotherme Verdichtung" (isothermal compression) from point 1 to point 2.  
2. "Isobare Wärmezufuhr" (isobaric heat addition) from point 2 to point 3.  
3. "Adiabatic, irreversible Turbine" from point 3 to point 4.  
4. "Isobare Mischkammer" (isobaric mixing chamber) from point 4 to point 5.  
5. "Isotherme Schubdüse" (isothermal nozzle) from point 5 to point 6.  

Dashed lines represent isobars and the dome region is labeled "Dome."

\( R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_{\text{Luft}}} \)  

\( S_6 - S_0 = S^0_6 - S^0_0 - R \ln \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right) \)  

Interpolation:  
\( S^0_6 = \frac{1.54191 - 1.47824}{250 - 240} (243.75 - 240) + 1.47824 \)  
\( = 1.4911 \, \text{(rounded to 4 decimal places)} \)  
\( = 1.49113 \, \text{(final value)} \)
