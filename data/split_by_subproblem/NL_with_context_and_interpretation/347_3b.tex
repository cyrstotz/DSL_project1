\( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} \) due to equilibrium in state 2.  

Water in state 1: \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) with \( x > 0 \), meaning it is in a two-phase state.  
From Table 1: At \( 0^\circ \text{C} \), \( p_{\text{EW}} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).  

State 2: \( p_{\text{EW},2} = p_{\text{atm}} \), still in a two-phase state, so  
\( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.401 \, \text{bar} \), as this includes the membrane and piston, which remain stationary, and the mass acting on the gas stays approximately constant.
