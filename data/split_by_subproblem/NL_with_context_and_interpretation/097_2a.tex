A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" for temperature.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]" for entropy.  

The diagram includes the following points and annotations:  
1. Point 1 is at the bottom left, labeled with "P0" and "-30° = 243.15K".  
2. Point 2 is slightly above Point 1, connected by a vertical line labeled "s = const".  
3. Point 3 is higher up, connected to Point 2 by a slanted line labeled "p = const".  
4. Point 4 is at the top right, connected to Point 3 by a vertical line labeled "s = const".  
5. Point 5 is below Point 4, connected by a slanted line labeled "p = const".  
6. Point 6 is to the right of Point 5, connected by a curved line labeled "s = const".  

Additional annotations:  
- "1289K" is written near Point 3.  
- "431.9K" is written near Point 5.  
- "Luft ideales Gas => keine 'Slücke'" (Air ideal gas => no "gaps").
