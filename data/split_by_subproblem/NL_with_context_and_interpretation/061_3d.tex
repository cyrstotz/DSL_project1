The pressure of the ice-water mixture (EW) is calculated as:  
p equals (m multiplied by g) divided by (pi multiplied by D squared divided by 4).  
Substituting values:  
m equals 32 kg, g equals 9.81 m/s squared, and D equals 10 cm.  
p equals 1 bar plus 0.4 bar, resulting in 1.4 bar.  

Delta E is calculated using the summation of Q minus the summation of W.  

The internal energy change is calculated as:  
m multiplied by (u2 minus u1) equals Q12.  
Substituting values:  
u2 equals uc plus x multiplied by (ul minus uc).  
u2 equals negative 200.39 kJ/kg.  

Substituting into the equation:  
u2 equals negative 200.39 plus (negative 200.398 plus 333.458) divided by (0.045 plus 3.33), resulting in 0.40.  

The final ice content is approximately 40%.
