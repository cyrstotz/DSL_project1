It would decrease until the condensation temperature of R134a reaches approximately minus 22 degrees Celsius, and then no more heat would be released because equilibrium is achieved.

The pressure is noted as 'p equals 1 mbar'.  
The temperature is corrected from 'Ti equals minus 10 degrees Celsius' to 'Ti equals minus 10 degrees Celsius'.
