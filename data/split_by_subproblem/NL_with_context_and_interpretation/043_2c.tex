Mass flow exergy  

mges multiplied by [haus minus hein minus T0 multiplied by (saus minus sein) plus one-half multiplied by (win squared minus wout squared)] equals exstr.  

(haus minus hein) equals cp multiplied by (Taus minus Tein) equals 1.006 multiplied by (340 minus 243.15).  
Ideal gas from intermediate solutions.  

T0 multiplied by (saus minus sein) equals T0 multiplied by cp multiplied by ln(Taus divided by Tein) minus Rln(paus divided by pein).  

Minus 243.15 multiplied by (1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by ln(340 divided by 243.15)) minus 82.093 megajoules multiplied by ln(paus divided by pein).  

mges multiplied by (92.434 megajoules minus 82.093 megajoules plus one-half multiplied by (40000 minus wg squared)) equals mges multiplied by (94.62821 megajoules) equals delta exstr.  

Make positive.
