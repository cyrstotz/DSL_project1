A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes the following labeled regions:  
- "ges채ttigte Fl체ssigkeit" (saturated liquid) on the left side.  
- "Nassdampfgebiet" (wet steam region) in the middle, under the curve.  
- "체berhitzter Dampf" (superheated steam) on the right side.  

The curve represents the phase boundary. Points labeled "1", "2", and "3" are marked along the curve, with "1" and "2" inside the wet steam region and "3" on the saturated liquid line. The temperature axis includes a mark at "-2째C".
