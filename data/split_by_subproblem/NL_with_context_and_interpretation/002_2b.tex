Energy balance around the jet engine:  

A schematic diagram is drawn showing the flow of energy.  

Equations:  
\( T_G = T_B \cdot \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \)  
\( \Rightarrow T_G = T_B \cdot \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{1.4-1}{1.4}} \)  
\( T_G = 325.07 \, \text{K} \)  

Energy balance equations:  
\( 0 = -\dot{m} \cdot (h_0 - h_1) + q_B - \dot{Q} \)  
\( 0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_1 - h_B) + w_e - w_1 - q_B \)  
\( 0 = 2 \cdot (h_1 - h_B) + (w_e^2 - w_1^2) + q_B \)  
\( 2 \cdot (h_1 - h_B) = q_B - (w_e^2 - w_1^2) \)  

Constants:  
\( n = 1.4 \)

O equals open bracket h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 plus w subscript k squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 5 squared divided by 2 close bracket plus arrow pointing to zero.

z equals w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 equals z open bracket h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 close bracket plus w subscript 5 squared divided by 2 equals c subscript p multiplied by open bracket T subscript 5 minus T subscript 6 close bracket multiplied by 1 divided by kappa minus 1 plus w subscript 5 squared divided by 2.

w subscript 6 equals square root of 2 multiplied by 1.006 multiplied by open bracket 431.9 minus 32.9 close bracket plus 220 squared divided by meters squared per second squared.
