A graph is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "p(pas)" (pressure).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "T(CÂ°)" (temperature).  

The graph shows a curve with phase regions labeled "fusion" and "gas." Points are marked on the curve:  
- Point 1 is at the lower end of the curve.  
- Point 2 is higher up on the curve.  
- Point 3 is near the top of the curve.
