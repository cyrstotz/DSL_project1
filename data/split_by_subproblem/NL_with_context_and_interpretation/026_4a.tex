Two diagrams are drawn:

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'p' (pressure).  
   - A rectangular cycle is depicted with four points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - Point 3 is marked at a pressure of '8 bar'.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the cycle: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1.

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - The x-axis is labeled as 'T [K]' (temperature in Kelvin).  
   - The y-axis is labeled as 'p [bar]' (pressure in bar).  
   - A dome-shaped curve is drawn, representing phase regions.  
   - A rectangular cycle is depicted within the dome, with points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the cycle: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1.
