The mass at state 2 multiplied by the internal energy at state 2, minus the mass at state 1 multiplied by the internal energy at state 1, equals the change in mass multiplied by the enthalpy of the inlet.  

From Table A-2 for uf, ug, and uf at 70 degrees Celsius:  
Internal energy of saturated liquid equals 418.94 kilojoules per kilogram.  
Internal energy of saturated vapor equals 2506.4 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Internal energy at state 1 equals uf plus steam quality multiplied by the difference between ug and uf.  
Internal energy at state 1 equals 429.28 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Internal energy at state 2 equals uf at 70 degrees Celsius.  
Internal energy at state 2 equals 292.95 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Enthalpy of the inlet equals 83.96 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Mass at state 2 equals the change in mass plus the mass at state 1.  

Change in mass multiplied by internal energy at state 2 plus mass at state 1 multiplied by the difference between internal energy at state 2 and internal energy at state 1 equals the change in mass multiplied by the enthalpy of the inlet.  

Change in mass equals mass at state 1 multiplied by the difference between internal energy at state 2 and internal energy at state 1, divided by the difference between enthalpy of the inlet and internal energy at state 2.  

Change in mass equals 3756.9 kilograms.
