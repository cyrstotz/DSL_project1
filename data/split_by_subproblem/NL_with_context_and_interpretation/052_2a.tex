A table is drawn with the following columns:  
- Z  
- p (bar)  
- T (K)  
- h  
- s  

The rows are partially filled:  
- Row 5: p = 0.5, T = 431.9  
- Row 6: p = 0.191, T = 328.075  

A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as T [K] and the x-axis labeled as s [kJ/kgÂ·K].  
The graph shows a qualitative T-s diagram with labeled points:  
- Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curve.  
- The curve includes segments labeled as "isobar," "adiabat," and "adiabat reversibel."
