The equation is written as:  
T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 5 equals (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

Substituting values:  
T subscript 6 equals T subscript 5 multiplied by (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of (0.9 divided by 1.4).  
T subscript 6 equals 328.07 K.  

The velocity equation is written as:  
w equals A multiplied by v dot divided by v subscript c.  
w subscript 6 equals w subscript 5 multiplied by (v subscript 5 divided by v subscript 6) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n.  

Substituting values:  
w subscript 6 equals w subscript 5 multiplied by (T subscript 5 divided by T subscript 6) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n.  
w subscript 6 equals 437.486 meters per second.
