The following equation is written:  
\[ \dot{m} \left[ h_5 - h_6 \right] + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} = 0 \]  

Additional notes:  
- \( w_5 = w_G \)  
- \( w_6 = w_C \)

Mass flow rate times flow exergy equals mass flow rate times the enthalpy minus the reference enthalpy minus the reference temperature times the entropy minus the reference entropy plus kinetic energy.  

Flow exergy at state 6 equals...  
Flow exergy at state 0 equals...  

Mass flow rate of mantle flow divided by mass flow rate of core flow equals 5.293.
