A diagram is drawn showing the process qualitatively in a T-s diagram. The axes are labeled:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin).  

The diagram includes the following points and annotations:  
- Point "0" is marked at the bottom left, labeled as "243.15 K" and "isobar".  
- Point "2" is connected to "0" with a vertical line labeled "isotrope" and "Training".  
- Point "3" is connected to "2" with a diagonal line labeled "adiabate".  
- Point "4" is connected to "3" with a horizontal line labeled "isobar".  
- Point "5" is connected to "4" with a diagonal line labeled "mixing isotrope".  
- Point "6" is connected to "5" with a diagonal line labeled "adiabate".  
- Point "6" is connected back to "0" with a dashed line labeled "isobar PO/PE".

O equals Delta ex_str plus Delta ex_Q minus ex_verl.  

O equals Delta ex_str plus Delta ex_Q minus ex_verl (crossed out: "combustion").  

Delta ex_Q equals (1 minus T_2 divided by T_B) multiplied by q_B.  

This equals (1 minus (1289 Kelvin divided by 1289 Kelvin)) multiplied by 1195 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta ex_verl equals Delta ex_str plus Delta ex_Q.
