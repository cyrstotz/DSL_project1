The pressure will remain constant because the atmospheric pressure and the weight do not change. Therefore, \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \).  

The temperature will drop to \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) because the EW is in equilibrium. This means water exists simultaneously as liquid and ice, which occurs exactly at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \).
