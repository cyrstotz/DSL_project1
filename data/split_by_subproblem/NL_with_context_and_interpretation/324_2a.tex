A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \). The temperature axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \), and the entropy axis is labeled \( s \, [kJ/kg·K] \). The process is shown with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The curve includes:  
- A compression process from 0 to 1.  
- A process from 1 to 2 labeled "vorverdichter mit \( \eta_{V,s} < 1 \)".  
- A process from 2 to 3 labeled "adiabatisch".  
- A process from 3 to 4 labeled "isobare Wärmezufuhr".  
- A process from 4 to 5 labeled "irreversible Turbine".  
- A process from 5 to 6 labeled "reversible nozzle".
