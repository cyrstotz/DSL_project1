T-s Diagram  

A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]". The graph shows a process with six states labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The transitions between states are marked with arrows.  

- 0 → 1: Adiabatic → isentropic compression  
  \( s_1 = s_0 \), \( p_1 > p_0 \), \( T_1 > T_0 \)  

- 1 → 2: Adiabatic → non-reversible → isentropic  
  \( s_1 > s_2 \)  

- 1 → 5: Reversible → isentropic, \( p_5 = p_0 \), isobaric  

- 2 → 3: Isobaric  

- 3 → 9: Non-reversible

(p divided by rho) plus four times kappa plus integral from zero to one of (c squared minus c zero squared) divided by rho one minus rho zero squared equals negative 45 times x squared.  

End equation.
