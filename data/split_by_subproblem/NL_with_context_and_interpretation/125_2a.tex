A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The diagram shows the process qualitatively with curves and arrows indicating transitions between states. The isobars are labeled, and the axes are marked as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T in K".  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "s in kJ/kg K".
