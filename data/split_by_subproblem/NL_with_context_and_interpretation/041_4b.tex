The process from state 2 to state 3 is described as "isotrop" (isentropic) and "adiabar" (adiabatic).  

An energy balance equation is written:  
dT = m dot times [h_i] plus Σ dot W_i equals Σ dot W_out.  

A note explains: "weil Arbeit am System verrichtet wird" (because work is performed on the system).  

Further equations are provided:  
0 equals m dot R134a times [h_2 minus h_3] plus W_K.  
m dot R134a equals W_K divided by (h_2 minus h_3).  

Additional details:  
h_2 equals h_g(T_2).  
T_2 equals ?.  
h_3 equals h_f(8 bar) plus x times (h_g(8 bar) minus h_f(8 bar)); x equals ?.  

An isentropic condition is noted:  
s_2 equals s_3.  
s_2 equals s_g(T_2).
