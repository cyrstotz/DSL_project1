State 1:  
Mass of ice-water mixture equals 0.1 kilograms.  
Ice fraction equals mass of ice divided by mass of ice-water mixture, which equals 0.6.  
Temperature equals 0 degrees Celsius.  

Energy balance for ice-water mixture with heat transfer:  
Change in internal energy equals heat transfer minus work, which equals zero because potential energy equals zero.  

Internal energy at state 1 equals ice fraction times latent heat of fusion at 0 degrees Celsius plus ice fraction times (internal energy of liquid minus internal energy of fusion) times mass of ice-water mixture.  

Internal energy at state 1 equals 20.125 joules.  

Internal energy at state 2 equals heat transfer plus internal energy at state 1, which equals -18.952 joules.  

Ice fraction equals internal energy at state 2 minus internal energy at fusion divided by internal energy of liquid minus internal energy at fusion.  

Internal energy at state 1 equals 0.1 kilograms times (-333.458 plus ice fraction times (-0.045 plus 333.458)), which equals -13.3 kilojoules.  

Internal energy at state 2 equals internal energy at state 1 plus heat transfer, which equals -12.25 kilojoules.
