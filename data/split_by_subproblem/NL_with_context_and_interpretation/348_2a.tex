A diagram is drawn representing a T-s (temperature-entropy) graph. The graph includes labeled isobars and process states:  
- State 1: Adiabatic  
- State 2: Isentropic  
- State 3: Isobaric  
- State 4: Isobaric  
- State 5: Isobaric  
- State 6: Adiabatic reversible  
The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T in K".  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "s in kJ/kgÂ·K".
