The question is written as: "m_R134a = ?"  

An equation is provided:  
- dE/dt = ṁ_R (h_2 - h_3) + Q̇ - Ẇ_k.  

Another equation is provided:  
- Ẇ_k / (h_2 - h_3) = ṁ_R134.  

Calculations:  
- h_2 (8 bar, x_2 = 1) = h_g (8 bar) = 264.15 kJ/kg (from Table A11).  
- h_3 (8 bar, S_2) => interpolate @ 8 bar with S_2:  
  h_3 = h(S_x) - h(S_y) / (x - y) (S_2 - S_y) + h_y.  
- S_2 (8 bar, x = 1) = 0.9066 kJ/kg·K = S_3.  

Diagrams and notes:  
- A circular diagram is drawn with arrows labeled "2" and "3."  
- Notes mention "adiabatic" and "stat so."
