An equation is written:  
"ṁ R134a (h ein - h aus) + Q12 = 0"  

Below the equation, the following notes are written:  
- "Q12 = ṁ R134a (h2 - h1) → ṁ R134a = Q12 / (h2 - h1)"  
- "isobare Verdampfung 1 → 2" (isobaric evaporation 1 → 2)  
- "GK = Tv gesättigten Dampf" (GK = Tv saturated vapor)  
- "2 → 3 adiabatic reversible h"  

Another equation is written:  
"ṁ R134a (h2 - h3) ± Q̇ = Ẇ K"  

Followed by:  
"ṁ R134a = Ẇ K / (h2 - h3)"  

Below this, another equation is written:  
"Ẇ ix = -28 W"  

Additional notes:  
- "h2"  
- "h3 (8 bar)"  
- "kann nicht finden" (cannot find)  

At the bottom:  
"s2 = s3"
