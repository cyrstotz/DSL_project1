The coefficient of performance (COP) is equal to Q subscript K divided by W subscript t, which is also equal to Q subscript K divided by W.  

Q equals m dot multiplied by (h subscript 1 minus h subscript 2) plus Q.  

Q equals m dot multiplied by (h subscript 2 minus h subscript 1).  

h subscript 1 equals h subscript 4 plus x multiplied by (h subscript 5 minus h subscript 4).  

h subscript 2 equals h subscript 5 equals 237.74.
