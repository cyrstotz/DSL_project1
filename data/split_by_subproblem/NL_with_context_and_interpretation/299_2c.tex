Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream six minus exergy stream zero.  
Delta exergy stream zero to six equals mass flow rate divided by gravity multiplied by (enthalpy zero minus enthalpy six minus temperature zero multiplied by (entropy zero minus entropy six)) plus one divided by two multiplied by mass flow rate zero squared minus one divided by two multiplied by mass flow rate six squared.  

Enthalpy zero at pressure zero point one nine one six bar and temperature negative thirty degrees Celsius equals 243.15 minus 240.02.  
Enthalpy zero equals A equals 240, B equals 250, C equals 243.15 times 10 to the power of 3, D equals 250.05 times 10 to the power of 3.  
Enthalpy zero minus C plus B divided by gravity equals 243179.45 plus 293779.16 divided by gravity.  
Enthalpy zero equals 328.398 times 10 to the power of 2 divided by gravity.  

Entropy zero equals A equals 240, C equals 7.78229, B equals 250, D equals 1.73723, S equals 57971 equals C plus 210.7296 times (zero minus C) divided by gravity.  
Entropy zero equals 14991.73 equals 7.79913 times 70.  

Entropy six equals A equals 325, C equals 7.78229, B equals 330, D equals 1.73723 equals C plus 210.7296 times (zero minus 336) divided by gravity.  
Entropy six equals 17991.99 equals 7.79997 times 70.  

Delta exergy stream equals 173079.77 divided by gravity.
