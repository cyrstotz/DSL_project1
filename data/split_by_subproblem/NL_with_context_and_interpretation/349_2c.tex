Delta E divided by m subscript g equals

The mass-specific increase in flow exergy is expressed as:  

\( ex_{str} = [h - h_0 - T_0 (s - s_0) + w^2 / 2] \)  

For state 6:  
\( ex_{str,6} = [h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + w_6^2 / 2] \)  

For state 0:  
\( ex_{str,0} = [h_0 - h_0 - T_0 (s_0 - s_0) + w_0^2 / 2] \)  

Simplifying:  
\( ex_{str,0} = w_0^2 / 2 = 20,000 \, \text{m}^2 / \text{s}^2 \)
