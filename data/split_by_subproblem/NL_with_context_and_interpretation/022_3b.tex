The pressure in the gas remains constant because the weight pressing down remains unchanged.  

p subscript g equals p subscript EW equals 1.4009 bar.  

T subscript g2 equals T subscript EW2 equals GGW.  

Since ice is still present in the two-phase equilibrium and the water remains at constant temperature, the pressure does not change. Therefore, the temperature also remains constant at 0 degrees Celsius. Since we are in equilibrium, T subscript g2 equals T subscript EW2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.
