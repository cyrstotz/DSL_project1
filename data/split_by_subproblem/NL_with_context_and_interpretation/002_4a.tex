A p-T diagram is drawn, showing phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Fest + Gas" (solid + gas), and "Gas" (gas). The diagram includes points labeled 1, 2, 3, and z, connected by arrows indicating transitions. The curve separates the phase regions, with a red line connecting points z and 3 vertically.
