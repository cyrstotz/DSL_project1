Exergy loss equals delta exergy flow.  

Energy balance for a stationary stream:  
Exergy loss equals delta exergy flow plus (1 minus T_0 divided by T_B) multiplied by Q_B minus Exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals minus 63.5 kilojoules per kilogram plus (1 minus 243.15 Kelvin divided by 1289 Kelvin) multiplied by 1195 kilojoules per kilogram.  
Exergy loss equals 506 kilojoules per kilogram.
