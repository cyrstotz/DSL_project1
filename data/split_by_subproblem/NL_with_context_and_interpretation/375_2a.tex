A graph is drawn representing a T-s diagram. The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]', and the y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'. The diagram includes several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves.  
- Isobars are labeled as \( p_0 \), \( p_3 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_5 \).  
- Arrows indicate the direction of processes between the points.
