A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the vertical axis and entropy (S) on the horizontal axis. The graph represents a T-S diagram with labeled points:  
- Point 1 at the bottom left.  
- Point 3 at a peak labeled "P2 = P5".  
- Point 4 descending from the peak.  
- Point 5 on the curve labeled "P4 = P5".  
- Point 6 at the bottom right labeled "P0 = P6".  
Arrows indicate the direction of the process flow between the points.
