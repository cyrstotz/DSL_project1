The diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph. It shows phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gasförmig" (gaseous).  
- The isotherm line is drawn horizontally, and the isobar line is drawn vertically.  
- Points labeled "1", "2", and "3" are marked on the graph, with arrows indicating transitions between states.
