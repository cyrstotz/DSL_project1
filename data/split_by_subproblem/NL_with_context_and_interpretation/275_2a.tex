\( T_0 = 263.15 \, \text{K} \)  
\( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
\( \dot{m}_M / \dot{m}_K = 5.293 \)  
\( c_p = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)  
\( k = 1.4 \)  

Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. **T-s Diagram**:  
   - The x-axis is labeled \( s \, [\text{kJ/kg·K}] \).  
   - The y-axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \).  
   - Isobars are drawn and labeled \( p_0 \) and \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
   - Points are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, connected by curves representing the process.  

2. **Zoomed T-s Diagram**:  
   - Similar axes as above.  
   - Points 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are connected by curves.  
   - Isobars \( p_0 \) and \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) are labeled.
