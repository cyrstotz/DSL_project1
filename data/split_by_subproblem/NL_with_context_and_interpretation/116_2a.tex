a) T-s diagram  

The diagram shows a temperature (T) versus entropy (s) graph. The vertical axis is labeled as 'T [K]', and the horizontal axis is labeled as 's [L/kgK]'.  

Key points and annotations:  
- The curve starts at point 0 (p0) and progresses through points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Point 1 is labeled with 'p = 0.5 bar'.  
- Point 2 is labeled with 's1 = s2'.  
- Point 3 is labeled with 'p2 = p'.  
- Point 5 is labeled with 'p = 0.5 bar' and 'anchauf 0.5 bar'.  
- Point 6 is labeled with 'p = 0.15 bar'.  

Below the diagram, there is a table with columns labeled as:  
- Z = state  
- P (pressure)  
- T [K] (temperature)  
- S (entropy)  
- h (enthalpy)  

The table entries are partially filled:  
- State 1: P = 0.5 bar  
- State 2: S1 = S2  
- State 5: P = 0.5 bar, T = 431.9  
- State 6: P = 0.15 bar, T = 328.075, S6 = S5  

Additional notes:  
- "Ideales gas: Isentrope K = 1.4"  
- Equation: T6 = T5 Ã— (p6 / p5)^(0.4 / 1.4)
