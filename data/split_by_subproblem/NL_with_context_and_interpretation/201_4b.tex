Given: \( \dot{m}_{R134a} \)  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\( 0 = \dot{m}_{R134a} (h_3 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_{ab} \)  

Rearranged:  
\( 0 = \dot{m}_{R134a} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K \)  
\( \Rightarrow \dot{m}_{R134a} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3} \)  

It is noted that:  
\( h_2 = h_g \), \( s_2 = s_3 \)  

\( h_3 (8 \, \text{bar}, T_3) \)  

A crossed-out term appears at the bottom of the section, but it is not transcribed as it is irrelevant.
