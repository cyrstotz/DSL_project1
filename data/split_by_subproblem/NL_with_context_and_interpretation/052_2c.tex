Delta exergy of flow equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus temperature at state 0 multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0)).  

Delta exergy of flow equals mass flow rate multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at state 6 minus temperature at state 0) minus temperature at state 0 multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by (natural logarithm of temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 0) minus gas constant multiplied by (natural logarithm of pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at state 0)) plus velocity at state 6 squared minus velocity at state 0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy of flow equals mass flow rate multiplied by (12.462 kilojoules per kilogram minus 10.050 kilojoules per kilogram), resulting in exergy of flow equals 122.512 kilojoules per kilogram.
