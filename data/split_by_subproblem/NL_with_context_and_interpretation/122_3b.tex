\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4008 \, \text{bar} \)  
\( T_{g,2} = T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  

State 2: No more heat transfer occurs.  
\( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \rightarrow T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  

Since ice remains in the EW, the temperature remains constant at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \). The pressure does not change in the gas because the substances remain constant, and the temperature of the gas matches the temperature of the water, as no heat exchange occurs in state 2.
