Energy balance around the nozzle:  
0 = ṁ × [h5 - h6 + (w5 squared - w6 squared) / 2]  

=> w6 = square root of [2 × (h5 - h6) + w5 squared]  
=> w6 = square root of [2 × (104.45 kJ/kg) + (220 m/s squared)]  
=> w6 = 220.97 m/s  

(Note: Some parts of the equation are crossed out and rewritten.)

T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

Cp equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

n equals kappa equals 1.4.  

T6 equals T5 times (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n), which equals 431.9 Kelvin times (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of (1 minus 1.4 divided by 1.4).  

h5 minus h6 equals Cp times (T5 minus T6), which equals 104.95 kilojoules per kilogram.  

T6 equals 328 Kelvin.
