A table is provided with columns labeled as follows:  
- \( \dot{m} \) (mass flow rate)  
- \( V \) (volume)  
- \( T \) (temperature)  
- \( p \) (pressure)  
- \( ex \) (exergy)  

Rows are numbered from 0 to 6, corresponding to the states in the T-s diagram. Each row contains numerical values for the respective columns, though some values are partially unclear.  

Additional notes:  
- \( \dot{m} = 0.02225 \, \text{kg/s} \) is written at the top left of the table.  
- A note below the table mentions "2 to 5 is reversible adiabatic."
