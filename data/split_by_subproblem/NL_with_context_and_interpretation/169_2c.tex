Delta ex_str equals h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0) plus Delta ke.  
This equals (h_0 minus h_6 minus T_c multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0)) plus (w_6 squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2).  
Given from Task 2:  
h_0 minus h_6 equals c_p multiplied by (T_0 minus T_c) equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by (243.15 Kelvin minus 340 Kelvin).  
T_c equals negative 30 plus 273.15 equals 243.15 Kelvin.  
h_0 minus h_6 approximately equals negative 97.43 kilojoules per kilogram.  
s_0 minus s_6 equals 0, as the process is adiabatic and reversible.  
Therefore, Delta ex_str equals (h_0 minus h_6 plus (w_6 squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2)).  
This equals (negative 97.43 kilojoules per kilogram plus (200 squared meters per second squared minus 510 squared meters per second squared divided by 2)).  
This equals (negative 97.43 kilojoules per kilogram plus (200 squared minus 510 squared divided by 2)).  
Approximately equals 207.48 kilojoules per kilogram.
