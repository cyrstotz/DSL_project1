\subsection*{9a}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a graph with the y-axis labeled \( p \, [\text{bar}] \) and the x-axis labeled \( T \, [K] \).
    \item The graph contains four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    \item Point 1 is at the intersection of the x-axis and a horizontal line extending from point 2.
    \item Point 2 is to the right of point 1 on the x-axis.
    \item Point 3 is above point 2 on a vertical line.
    \item Point 4 is to the left of point 3 on a horizontal line.
    \item Arrows indicate the direction of the process: from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to 1.
    \item The process from 1 to 2 is labeled as "isentrop".
    \item The process from 2 to 3 is labeled as "isentrop".
    \item The process from 3 to 4 is labeled as "isobar".
    \item The process from 4 to 1 is labeled as "Drucklerringerig".
