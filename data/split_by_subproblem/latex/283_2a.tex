\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( T \, [K] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( S \, \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right] \). There are two curves on the graph. The first curve starts at point labeled \( 0 \) at the bottom left, moves upwards in a zigzag pattern, and ends at a point labeled \( 1 \) at the top right. The second curve starts at a point labeled \( 1 \) near the top left, moves downwards in a zigzag pattern, and ends at a point labeled \( 2 \) at the bottom right.
    
    \item[Graph 2:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( T \, [K] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( S \, \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right] \). There are six points labeled \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \) and \( 6 \). The curve starts at point \( 0 \) at the bottom left, moves upwards to point \( 1 \), then continues upwards to point \( 2 \) labeled "isobare", then reaches a peak at point \( 3 \). From point \( 3 \), the curve moves downwards to point \( 4 \), then slightly upwards to point \( 5 \) with a horizontal dashed line labeled \( T_5 = 431.0 \, K \), and finally moves downwards to point \( 6 \).
