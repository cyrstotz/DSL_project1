\textbf{Description of the first graph:} 

The first graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as \( T [K] \) and the y-axis labeled as \( p [mbar] \). There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The points are connected to form a closed loop. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "isobar", the path from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "adiabat", the path from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "isobar", and the path from point 4 to point 1 is labeled as "adiabat".

\textbf{Description of the second graph:} 

The second graph is also a plot with the x-axis labeled as \( T [K] \) and the y-axis labeled as \( p [mbar] \). There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The points are connected to form a closed loop. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "isobar", the path from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "isobar", the path from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "isobar", and the path from point 4 to point 1 is labeled as "isobar".
