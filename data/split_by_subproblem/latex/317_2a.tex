\end{center}

The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and the x-axis labeled as \( s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \) (entropy). The plot contains a cycle with six points labeled 1 through 6. The cycle is described as follows:

- Point 1 to Point 2: A vertical line labeled "isentrop".
- Point 2 to Point 3: An upward sloping line labeled "isobar".
- Point 3 to Point 4: A horizontal line.
- Point 4 to Point 5: A vertical line labeled "isentrop".
- Point 5 to Point 6: A downward sloping line.
- Point 6 to Point 1: A curved line with a zigzag pattern indicating some form of complex process.
