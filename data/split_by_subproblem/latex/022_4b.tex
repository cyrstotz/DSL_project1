\begin{itemize}
    \item The second graph is a phase diagram with pressure \( p \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis.
    \item The y-axis is labeled with \([ \text{bar} ]\).
    \item The x-axis is labeled with \([ \text{K} ]\).
    \item There are three regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "gas" (gas).
    \item The graph shows a line sloping upwards from left to right, separating the "fest" and "gas" regions, with a point labeled \( T_{\text{ripel}} \).
    \item An arrow labeled "Sublimation" points from the "fest" region to the "gas" region.
\end{itemize}
