    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) [K] and the horizontal axis is labeled \( s \) [\(\frac{kJ}{K}\)]. The graph consists of six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by various lines indicating different processes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 to Point 2: A vertical line labeled "isentrop".
        \item Point 2 to Point 3: A horizontal line labeled "isobar".
        \item Point 3 to Point 4: A vertical line labeled "isentrop".
        \item Point 4 to Point 5: A horizontal line labeled "isobar".
        \item Point 5 to Point 6: A vertical line labeled "isentrop".
    \end{itemize}
    There are also two isobars labeled \( p_0 \) (isobare) and \( p_5 \) drawn as curved lines. The points \( p_3 = p_4 \) and \( 5_s, 5 \) are also indicated.
