        \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($P$-$T$) diagram. It consists of three curves and three points labeled 1, 2, and 3. The first curve is a vertical line starting from point 1 and moving upwards to point 2. The second curve is a horizontal line starting from point 2 and moving leftwards to point 3. The third curve is a diagonal line starting from point 3 and moving upwards to the right. The x-axis is labeled with a right arrow and the letter $T$ indicating temperature. The y-axis is labeled with a top arrow and the letter $P$ indicating pressure.
