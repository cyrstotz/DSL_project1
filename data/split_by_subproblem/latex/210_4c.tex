\begin{itemize}
    \item A diagram of a throttle is drawn with an inlet and an outlet.
    \item The inlet is labeled with $8 \text{bar}$ and an arrow pointing into the throttle.
    \item The outlet is labeled with $p_1 = p_2$ and an arrow pointing out of the throttle.
    \item The points before and after the throttle are labeled as "4" and "1" respectively.
\end{itemize}

\[
\phi = \phi_f + x (\phi_g - \phi_f)
\]

\[

\[
\Rightarrow h_4 = h_1
\]

\[
h_4 = 264.15
\]

\[
x = \frac{h_4 - h_{f1}}{h_{g1} - h_{f1}} = \frac{264.15 - 253.43}{272.02 - 253.43}
\]

\[
h_g(p_1) = h_f(p_4)
\]

\[
h_f \quad \text{aus AB} \quad @ \quad 8 \text{bar} = 264.15
\]
