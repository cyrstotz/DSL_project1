\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[ \text{°C} \right]$. The graph contains several lines and points:

- A line starting from the origin (0,0) and moving upwards to the right.
- Another line starting from the origin and moving upwards to the left.
- A curved line labeled $1$ starting from the left line and moving upwards to the right.
- A point labeled $2$ on the curved line.
- A point labeled $3$ on the curved line further up from point $2$.
- A horizontal line from point $2$ to the right, labeled $0.1 \text{bar}$.
- A point labeled $4$ on the right side of the graph.
- A point labeled $5$ on the left side of the graph.
- A point labeled $6$ on the left side of the graph below point $5$.
