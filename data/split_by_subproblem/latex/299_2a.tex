    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $s$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T$. The graph contains several points and lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 0 is at the origin.
        \item Point 1 is slightly above point 0.
        \item Point 2 is to the right of point 1, connected by a line labeled "isotrop".
        \item Point 3 is above point 2, connected by a vertical line labeled "isobar".
        \item Point 4 is to the right of point 3, connected by a line labeled "P2=P3".
        \item Point 5 is below point 4, connected by a line labeled "isobar".
        \item There is a dashed line connecting point 0 to point 5, labeled $p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}$.
        \item $T_5 = 437.9 \, \text{K}$ is marked on the y-axis.
        \item $T_0: > 30$ is marked on the y-axis.
    \end{itemize}
