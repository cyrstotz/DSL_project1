\textbf{Graph Description:} The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled "Entropie $S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$" and the y-axis is labeled "Temperatur $T \left[ K \right]$". The curve starts from a point near the origin, rises steeply, then flattens out slightly before rising steeply again. The curve is drawn in blue.
