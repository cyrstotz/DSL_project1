\textbf{Graph Description:} The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($P$-$T$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $T$ [K] and the y-axis is labeled $P$ [bar]. There are four points labeled (1), (2), (3), and (4) forming a square. The process between points (1) and (2) is labeled as "isobar", between (2) and (3) as "isotherm", between (3) and (4) as "isobar", and between (4) and (1) as "isotherm". There is a vertical zigzag line on the left side of the graph, indicating a phase change or a specific process.
