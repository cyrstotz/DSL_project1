\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( T \, [K] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( S \, \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \). The vertical axis has tick marks at 243.15, 322.08, 431.9, and 1289. The horizontal axis has tick marks at 0, 1, 2, and 3. There are two curves on the graph. The first curve starts at the origin (0,0), goes through the point labeled 1, and then curves upwards to the right, passing through the point labeled 2. The second curve starts at the point labeled 3, goes upwards to the right, passing through the point labeled 4, and then curves downwards to the right, passing through the points labeled 5 and 6. The point labeled 4 is marked with \( P = P_2 \) and the point labeled 6 is marked with \( P = P_0 \).
