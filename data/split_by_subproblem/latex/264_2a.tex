    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Entropy (P-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled as $P$. The graph consists of six points labeled 1 through 6. The process between points 1 and 2 is a vertical line labeled "isotherme Verdichtung". The process between points 2 and 3 is a diagonal line labeled "isobare Wärmezufuhr". The process between points 3 and 4 is a vertical line labeled "adiabate, irreversible Turbine". The process between points 4 and 5 is a horizontal line labeled "isobare Mischkammer". The process between points 5 and 6 is a vertical line labeled "isotherme Schubdüse". There are dashed lines indicating isobars and isotherms.
