    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $T$ (Temperature) and the y-axis is labeled as $s$ (Entropy). There are several curves and points marked on the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A curve labeled "adiabat $s = \text{const}$" starting from the bottom left and moving upwards to the right.
        \item Another curve labeled "adiabat $s = \text{const}$" parallel to the first one but starting higher on the y-axis.
        \item A curve labeled "isobar $p_0 = p_6$" starting from the bottom left and moving upwards to the right, intersecting the adiabats.
        \item Points labeled 1 through 6, with arrows indicating transitions between these points.
        \item A curve labeled "isotherm" starting from point 1 and moving horizontally to the right.
        \item A curve labeled "isotherm" starting from point 4 and moving horizontally to the right.
        \item A curve labeled "isotherm" starting from point 5 and moving horizontally to the right.
        \item A curve labeled "isotherm" starting from point 6 and moving horizontally to the right.
    \end{itemize}
