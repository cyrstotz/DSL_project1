    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( T \) and the y-axis is labeled \( P \). There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 forming a closed loop. The path from 1 to 2 is a vertical line, from 2 to 3 is a horizontal line, from 3 to 4 is a vertical line, and from 4 to 1 is a horizontal line. The area inside the loop is shaded.
