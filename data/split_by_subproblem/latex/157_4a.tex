    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a phase diagram with three regions labeled "Fest", "Flüssig", and "Gas". The x-axis is labeled "T" and the y-axis is labeled "P". There are three points labeled 1, 2, and 3. Point 1 is in the "Gas" region, point 2 is in the "Flüssig" region, and point 3 is in the "Fest" region. There are several lines connecting these points, indicating phase transitions.
    \item[Graph 2:] The graph is a simplified phase diagram with the x-axis labeled "T" and the y-axis labeled "P". There are three points labeled 1, 2, and 3. Point 1 is in the "Flüssig" region, point 2 is in the "Fest" region, and point 3 is in the "Gas" region. The lines connecting these points indicate phase transitions.
