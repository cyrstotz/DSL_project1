\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] A temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram with several curves and points labeled. The x-axis is labeled $s$ (kJ/kgK) and the y-axis is labeled $T$ (K). There are five points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, point 4 is below point 3, and point 5 is to the left of point 4. There are several curves connecting these points, indicating different processes. There is a note "kein Punkt" near the middle of the diagram. The following labels are present:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $p_2 = p_3$
        \item $S_1 = S_2$
        \item $p_4 = p_5 = 0.5 \text{ bar}$
        \item $p_1 = 0.5 \text{ bar}$
        \item $S_5 = S_6$
    \end{itemize}

    \item[Graph 2:] Another temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram with the x-axis labeled $s$ (kJ/kgK) and the y-axis labeled $T$ (K). There are five points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Point 0 is at the bottom left, point 1 is above point 0, point 2 is above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, point 4 is below point 3, and point 5 is below point 4. There are several curves connecting these points, indicating different processes. The following labels are present:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $p_1 = p_4 = p_5$
        \item $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5$
    \end{itemize}
