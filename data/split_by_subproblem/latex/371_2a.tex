\subsection*{a) T [K]}
\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] 
    The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( T \, [K] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \). The plot starts at the origin and initially rises steeply, then levels off to a horizontal line at point 2. From point 2, it rises again to point 3, forming a peak at point 4. After point 4, the graph descends to point 5 and then sharply rises again. The points are labeled as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 2: Located on the horizontal line.
        \item Point 3: Located at the peak of the curve.
        \item Point 4: Located at the descending part of the curve.
        \item Point 5: Located at the sharp rise after the descent.
    \end{itemize}
    There is a horizontal line connecting points 2 and 4, and a vertical line connecting point 2 to the horizontal axis.
