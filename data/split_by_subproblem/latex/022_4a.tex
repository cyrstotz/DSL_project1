\begin{itemize}
    \item The first graph is a phase diagram with pressure \( p \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis.
    \item The y-axis is labeled with \([ \text{bar} ]\).
    \item The x-axis is labeled with \([ \text{K} ]\).
    \item There are three regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gas" (gas).
    \item The graph shows three lines intersecting at a point labeled \( T_{\text{ripel}} \):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A line sloping downwards from left to right, separating the "fest" and "flüssig" regions.
            \item A line sloping upwards from left to right, separating the "flüssig" and "gas" regions.
            \item A line sloping upwards from left to right, separating the "fest" and "gas" regions.
        \end{itemize}
