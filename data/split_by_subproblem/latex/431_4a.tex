\begin{itemize}
    \item The first graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled \( p(T) \) and the x-axis labeled \( T(K) \). The graph shows a curve that starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls back down. The regions under the curve are labeled as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The region to the left of the peak is labeled "Unterk체hlte Fl체ssigkeit".
            \item The region under the peak is labeled "Masse\_dampf".
            \item The region to the right of the peak is labeled "체bers채ttigter Dampf".
        \end{itemize}
