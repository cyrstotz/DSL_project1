    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $S$ and the y-axis labeled as $h \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg} \right]$. There are six points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The points are connected by lines forming a cycle. The line connecting points 1 and 2 is vertical. The line connecting points 2 and 3 is curved and labeled "isobare". The line connecting points 3 and 4 is horizontal. The line connecting points 4 and 5 is curved. The line connecting points 5 and 6 is vertical. There is a horizontal line labeled $P_0$ below point 6. The points are connected as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 to Point 2 (vertical line)
        \item Point 2 to Point 3 (curved line labeled "isobare")
        \item Point 3 to Point 4 (horizontal line)
        \item Point 4 to Point 5 (curved line)
        \item Point 5 to Point 6 (vertical line)
    \end{itemize}
