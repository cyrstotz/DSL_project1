\begin{itemize}
    \item Graph: T-S Diagram
    \item The x-axis is labeled as $s$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T$.
    \item There is a curve starting from point 0 to point 1, labeled as "isentrop, $T_1$".
    \item From point 1 to point 2, the curve is labeled as "mk = isentrop, $T_2$".
    \item From point 2 to point 3, the curve is labeled as "ink = isobar $T_3$".
    \item From point 3 to point 4, the curve is labeled as "mk = irreversible Turbine".
    \item From point 4 to point 5, the curve is labeled as "mk + mk = isobar".
    \item From point 5 to point 6, the curve is labeled as "isotherm".
    \item The curve from point 0 to point 1 is marked as "isentrop".
    \item The curve from point 1 to point 2 is marked as "isentrop".
    \item The curve from point 2 to point 3 is marked as "isobar".
    \item The curve from point 3 to point 4 is marked as "irreversible Turbine".
    \item The curve from point 4 to point 5 is marked as "isobar".
    \item The curve from point 5 to point 6 is marked as "isotherm".
    \item There is a note: "Sorry, Deutsch-Salat im Kopf, ich meine isentrop".
