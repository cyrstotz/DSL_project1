    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The y-axis is labeled \( T \) with the unit \( [K] \). The x-axis is labeled \( s \) with the unit \( \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \). There are three isobars labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_B \), and \( p_S \) from bottom to top. The graph shows a cycle with six states labeled \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \). The process moves from state 0 to 1, then to 2, 3, 4, 5, and back to 0. The paths between states are marked with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
