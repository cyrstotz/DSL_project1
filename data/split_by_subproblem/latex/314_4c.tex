The graph is a pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The $y$-axis is labeled $p$ (bar) and the $x$-axis is labeled $T$ (Â°C). The graph shows three distinct regions labeled "solid", "liquid", and "gas". 

- The "solid" region is on the left side of the graph.
- The "liquid" region is in the middle.
- The "gas" region is on the right side.

There is a curve separating the "solid" and "liquid" regions, and another curve separating the "liquid" and "gas" regions. 

An isobar is drawn horizontally across the "liquid" region, labeled as "isobar".
