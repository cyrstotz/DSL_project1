    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( p \) with units \([ \text{bar} ]\) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T \) with units \([ ^\circ \text{C} ]\). The graph shows a line starting from the origin and increasing linearly, labeled as "fast". There is a horizontal line intersecting the linear line at a point labeled \( q_1 \). From this intersection point, a vertical line labeled \( q_2 \) extends upwards. The region above the linear line is labeled "gas", and the region below is labeled "fl√ºssig".
