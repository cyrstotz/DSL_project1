\textbf{Graph Description:} The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The y-axis is labeled $T(\text{K})$ and the x-axis is labeled $S \left( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}} \right)$. There are three isobars drawn as curved lines, labeled 0.15 bar, 0.5 bar, and an unlabeled isobar. There are six points labeled 1 through 6, connected by lines indicating processes. The points are connected as follows: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6. The points 1 and 6 are on the 0.15 bar isobar, points 2 and 5 are on the 0.5 bar isobar, and points 3 and 4 are on the unlabeled isobar.
