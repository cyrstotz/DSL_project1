    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \left[ K \right]$. There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The points are connected by different processes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 0 to Point 1: Isobaric process labeled $p = \text{const}$.
        \item Point 1 to Point 2: Isentropic process labeled $s = \text{const}$.
        \item Point 2 to Point 3: Isobaric process labeled $p = \text{const}$.
        \item Point 3 to Point 4: Isentropic process labeled $s = \text{const}$.
        \item Point 4 to Point 5: Isobaric process labeled $p = \text{const}$.
        \item Point 5 to Point 6: Isentropic process labeled $s = \text{const}$.
    \end{itemize}
    There is also a small sketch in the bottom left corner showing a similar T-s diagram with a cycle labeled "Kreisprozess".
