\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram.
    \item The x-axis is labeled $S \, [\frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}]$.
    \item The y-axis is labeled $T \, [K]$.
    \item There is a dome-shaped curve in the middle of the graph, representing the phase change region.
    \item Two straight lines intersect the dome-shaped curve, one with a positive slope and one with a negative slope.
\end{itemize}
