\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram.
    \item The x-axis is labeled $S \left( \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right)$.
    \item The y-axis is labeled $T [K]$.
    \item There are three pressure lines labeled $p_0$, $p_1$, and $p_c$ (with $p_c$ being much greater than $p_0$).
    \item The graph contains five points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    \item The process from point 1 to point 2 is a vertical line labeled "isentrop".
    \item The process from point 2 to point 3 is a diagonal line labeled "n<1".
    \item The process from point 3 to point 4 is a horizontal line labeled "isentrop".
    \item The process from point 4 to point 5 is a diagonal line labeled "n<1".
    \item The process from point 5 to point 1 is a vertical line labeled "isentrop".
