\textbf{Description of the graph:} The graph is a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram. The y-axis is labeled "p [bar]" and the x-axis is labeled "T [K]". The graph shows a curve that starts at the origin, rises to a peak labeled "Triple point", and then descends. The regions under the curve are labeled "Solid" on the left, "Liquid" in the middle, and "Vapor" on the right.
