\begin{itemize}
    \item The process is an adiabatic throttle and is isenthalpic.
    \item The enthalpies are given as:
    \[
    h_3 = h_4
    \]
    \[
    h_4 \left( 8 \text{ bar}, x = 0 \right) = 93.42 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}
    \]
    \item The student notes that they now need to find $T_1$.
