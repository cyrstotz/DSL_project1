    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \left[ K \right]$. The graph shows a cycle with six points labeled 1 through 6. The process between points 1 and 2 is labeled "isobar", between points 2 and 3 is labeled "isobar", between points 3 and 4 is labeled "isentrop", between points 4 and 5 is labeled "isobar", between points 5 and 6 is labeled "isobar", and between points 6 and 1 is labeled "isentrop". The cycle is drawn with a combination of curved and straight lines.
