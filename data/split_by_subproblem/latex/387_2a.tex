    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled $T(u)$ and the horizontal axis labeled $s(\frac{u}{u_s u})$. The graph consists of several points and lines connecting them. The points are labeled as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point $0$ at the origin.
        \item Point $1$ above and to the right of point $0$.
        \item Point $2$ directly to the right of point $1$.
        \item Point $3$ above and to the right of point $2$.
        \item Point $4$ below and to the right of point $3$.
        \item Point $5$ below and to the left of point $4$.
        \item Point $6$ below and to the right of point $5$.
    \end{itemize}
    The lines connecting the points are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A solid line from point $0$ to point $1$.
        \item A solid line from point $1$ to point $2$.
        \item A solid line from point $2$ to point $3$.
        \item A solid line from point $3$ to point $4$.
        \item A solid line from point $4$ to point $5$.
        \item A solid line from point $5$ to point $6$.
        \item A dashed line from point $0$ to point $6$.
    \end{itemize}
    The graph also includes several horizontal dashed lines labeled $P_1$, $P_2 = P_3$, $P_4$, and $P_5, P_1$.
