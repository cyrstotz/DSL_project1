\begin{description}
    \item[Graph:] The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $s$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T$. The graph starts at the origin (0,0). There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is at the origin. Point 2 is above and to the right of point 1. Point 3 is further to the right of point 2, and point 4 is directly below point 3. The path from point 1 to point 2 is a vertical line, indicating an isochoric process. The path from point 2 to point 3 is a curved line, indicating an isobaric process. The path from point 3 to point 4 is a vertical line, indicating another isochoric process. The path from point 4 back to point 1 is a curved line, indicating another isobaric process. The area enclosed by the points 1-2-3-4-1 is shaded.
