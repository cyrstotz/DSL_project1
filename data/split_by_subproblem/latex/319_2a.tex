    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $s$ in $\frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}$ and the y-axis labeled as $T$ in $K$. There are three curves plotted on the graph, each representing different pressures. The curves are labeled as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The topmost curve is labeled $p = 0.5 \, \text{bar}$.
        \item The middle curve is labeled $p = 0.2 \, \text{bar}$.
        \item The bottom curve is labeled $p = 0.1 \, \text{bar}$.
    \end{itemize}
    Each curve starts from a common point on the y-axis and diverges as it moves to the right along the x-axis. The curves are smooth and upward sloping, indicating a positive relationship between $T$ and $s$ for each pressure level.
