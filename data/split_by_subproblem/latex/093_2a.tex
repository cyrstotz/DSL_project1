    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is drawn on a grid paper with the x-axis labeled as $s$ and the y-axis not labeled. There are several curves and points marked on the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point $0$ at the origin.
        \item Point $1$ slightly above and to the right of $0$.
        \item Point $2$ above and to the right of $1$.
        \item Point $3$ above and to the right of $2$.
        \item Point $6$ below and to the right of $1$.
        \item Point $9$ above and to the right of $6$.
        \item A curve labeled "rev." connecting points $0$, $1$, and $2$.
        \item A curve connecting points $2$ and $3$.
        \item A curve connecting points $3$ and $9$.
        \item A curve connecting points $9$ and $6$.
        \item A curve connecting points $6$ and $1$.
        \item A curve connecting points $1$ and $0$.
        \item Several isobaric lines labeled "30 bar", "50 bar", and "70 bar" running roughly parallel to each other and sloping upwards to the right.
