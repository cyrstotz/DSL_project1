\subsection*{a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as $T$ [K] and the y-axis labeled as $P$ [bar].
    \item The graph consists of a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    \item Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is at the top left, point 3 is at the top right, and point 4 is at the bottom right.
    \item Arrows indicate the direction of the cycle, moving from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 back to 1.
    \item The curve from 1 to 2 and from 3 to 4 is labeled "isotherm".
    \item The curve from 2 to 3 and from 4 to 1 is labeled "adiabatic".
    \item The top part of the graph is labeled "gegebene Dampf".
    \item The bottom part of the graph is labeled "Nassdampf Gebiet".
