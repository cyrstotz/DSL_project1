\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The horizontal axis is labeled $T$ (temperature) and the vertical axis is labeled $p$ (pressure). The graph contains a dome-shaped curve representing the phase boundary between liquid and vapor phases. 

- Point 1 is located on the left side of the dome, within the liquid region.
- Point 2 is on the right side of the dome, within the vapor region.
- Point 3 is on the right side of the dome, within the vapor region, but at a higher pressure than point 2.
- Point 4 is on the left side of the dome, within the liquid region, but at a higher pressure than point 1.
- Point 5 is at the top of the dome, representing the critical point.

The graph also includes arrows indicating transitions between these points:
- An arrow from point 1 to point 2.
- An arrow from point 2 to point 3.
- An arrow from point 3 to point 4.
- An arrow from point 4 to point 1.
- An arrow from point 1 to point 5.
