    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a $p$-$T$ diagram with the $p$ axis (pressure) on the vertical and the $T$ axis (temperature) on the horizontal. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The path from 1 to 2 is labeled "isobar", from 2 to 3 is labeled "isotrop", from 3 to 4 is labeled "isobar", and from 4 to 1 is labeled "adiabat". The paths form a closed loop.
