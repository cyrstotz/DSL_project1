\textbf{Verbal description of the graph:}

The graph is a $T$-$s$ diagram. The x-axis is labeled $S \left[\frac{kJ}{kgK}\right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T[K]$. The graph consists of a closed loop with six points labeled 1 through 6. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isobar", from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isochor", from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "adiabat", from point 4 to point 5 is labeled "isobar", from point 5 to point 6 is labeled "isotherm", and from point 6 back to point 1 is labeled "isobar". There is a horizontal line from point 2 to point 5 labeled "MM". The pressure at point 3 is labeled $p_3 = p_1$ and the pressure at point 6 is labeled $p_6 = p_a$.
