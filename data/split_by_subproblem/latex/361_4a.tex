    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( T \) (Temperature) and the y-axis is labeled \( P \) (Pressure). There are three regions labeled "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). The boundary lines between these regions are shown, with a point labeled \( i \) on the line between "Fest" and "Flüssig", a point labeled \( ii \) on the line between "Flüssig" and "Gas", and a point labeled \( iii \) on the line between "Fest" and "Gas".
