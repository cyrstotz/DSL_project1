\section*{2) a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The diagram is a graph with a horizontal axis labeled $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right]$ and a vertical axis labeled $T \left[ K \right]$.
    \item There are six points labeled 1 through 6.
    \item Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is directly above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, point 4 is directly above point 3, point 5 is to the right of point 4, and point 6 is directly below point 5.
    \item The path from point 1 to point 6 is a zigzag pattern with lines connecting the points in the order 1-2-3-4-5-6.
    \item There are dashed lines extending horizontally from points 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    \item The dashed lines are labeled as follows: $p_2 = p_3$, $p_4$, $p_5$, and $p_6$.
    \item The line connecting points 1 and 2 is labeled $p_0 = p_1$.
