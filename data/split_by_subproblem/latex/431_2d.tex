0 &= (e_{2,st,c} + e_{2,st,0}) + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_e} \right) \dot{Q} - \dot{e}_{k,rev} = 0 \\
\dot{e}_{k,rev} &= e_{k,st,0} - e_{k,st,c} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T_e} \right) \left( \frac{263.15 kJ}{128.5 kJ} \right) \\

\subsection*{Graphical Content}

There is a small diagram in part

(d) that appears to be a sketch of a thermodynamic cycle or process. The diagram consists of a closed loop with arrows indicating the direction of the process. The axes are not labeled, and there are no numerical values or specific points marked on the diagram. The loop is drawn in a rough, freehand style, suggesting it is a conceptual illustration rather than a precise graph.
