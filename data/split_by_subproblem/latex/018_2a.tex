Graph description: The graph is a Temperature-Entropy ($T$-$s$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \, \left[\frac{kJ}{kgK}\right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \, [K]$. The graph contains six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected as follows:
- Point 1 to Point 2 is a vertical line labeled "isotrop".
- Point 2 to Point 3 is a curved line labeled "isobar".
- Point 3 to Point 4 is a vertical line labeled "isotrop".
- Point 4 to Point 5 is a curved line labeled "isobar".
- Point 5 to Point 6 is a vertical line labeled "isotrop".
- Point 6 to Point 1 is a curved line labeled "isobar".
