\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph has a title at the top left corner: \(h(T_2)\).
    \item The x-axis is labeled \([T/K]\) and the y-axis is labeled \(h\).
    \item There are two points marked on the y-axis: one at the origin (0) and another at a higher value (1).
    \item There are two points marked on the x-axis: one at the origin (0) and another at a higher value (2).
    \item The graph contains a curve that starts from the origin, oscillates, and then follows a roughly linear path upwards.
