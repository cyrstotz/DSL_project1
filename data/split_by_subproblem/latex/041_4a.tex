\begin{itemize}
    \item The first graph is a pressure ($p$) vs. temperature ($T$) diagram. The $p$-axis is vertical and the $T$-axis is horizontal. The graph shows a complex curve with multiple peaks and valleys, and a straight line intersecting the curve.
    \item The second graph is also a pressure ($p$) vs. temperature ($T$) diagram. The $p$-axis is vertical and the $T$-axis is horizontal. The graph shows three distinct regions labeled "fest" (solid), "fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). There is a point labeled $T_P$ on the curve separating the solid and liquid regions, and another point labeled $T_i$ on the curve separating the liquid and gas regions.
