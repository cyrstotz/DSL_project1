\begin{description}
    \item[Graph:] The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( p[\text{bar}] \) and the x-axis labeled as \( T[\degree C] \). There are two lines labeled (i) and (ii). Line (i) starts from the origin and goes upwards with a positive slope. Line (ii) starts from the same point as line (i) but has a steeper slope. The region between the two lines is labeled as "test". The area below line (i) is labeled as "fl√ºssig" and the area above line (ii) is labeled as "gas".
