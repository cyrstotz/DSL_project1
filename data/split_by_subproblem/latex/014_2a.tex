\section*{2 a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a Temperature-Entropy ($T$-$s$) diagram.
    \item The x-axis is labeled $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$.
    \item The y-axis is labeled $T \left[ ^\circ C \right]$.
    \item There are two isobaric lines labeled $p_0$ and $p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}$.
    \item The graph contains six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    \item The points are connected by lines indicating the process path.
    \item The path starts at point 0, moves to point 1, then to point 2, then to point 3, then to point 4, then to point 5, and finally to point 6.
