    \item[Graph:] The graph is a pressure-volume (p-V) diagram. The x-axis is labeled with $V$ (volume) and the y-axis is labeled with $p$ (pressure). The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The path from point 1 to point 2 is a horizontal line, the path from point 2 to point 3 is a vertical line, the path from point 3 to point 4 is a horizontal line, and the path from point 4 to point 1 is a vertical line. The loop forms a rectangle.
