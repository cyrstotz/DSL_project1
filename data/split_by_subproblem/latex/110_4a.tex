\section*{4 a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $T$ [\textdegree K] and the y-axis labeled as $P$ [bar].
    \item There are three distinct regions labeled as "Fest", "Flüssig", and "gas".
    \item The graph has a line starting from the origin (0,0) and moving upwards to the right, labeled as "Flüssig".
    \item Another line starts from the same origin and moves upwards to the right at a steeper angle, labeled as "gas".
    \item The intersection of these two lines is labeled as $T_i$.
    \item There is a horizontal dashed line at $P = 5 \text{ bar}$.
    \item The x-axis has a point labeled as $T_i$ and another point labeled as $0$.
\end{itemize}

\[
T_i = \text{solid } \frac{dH}{dT}
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{liquid} = \text{gas}
\]

\[
x = 1 \quad P/E \quad \text{solid?}
\]
