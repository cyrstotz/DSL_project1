\[
\begin{array}{c}
\text{Graph of } \Gamma [\Lambda] \text{ vs. } \int \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right) d\left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right) \\
\end{array}
\]

\noindent
The graph has the following features:
- The x-axis is labeled as $\int \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right) d\left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)$.
- The y-axis is labeled as $\Gamma [\Lambda]$.
- There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The points are connected by arrows indicating a path from 0 to 6.
- The path goes from 0 to 1, then to 2, then to 3, then to 4, then to 5, and finally to 6.
- There are labels "isentrope" and "isotherm" indicating different segments of the path.
