    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( S \, [\frac{kJ}{K}] \) and the y-axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \). There are five points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The curve starts at point 1, rises to point 2, then to point 3, and continues to point 4. From point 4, it drops down to point 5. The segment from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isentrop", the segment from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "heating", the segment from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "heating", and the segment from point 4 to point 5 is labeled "isentrop". Point 4 is also labeled "Kritischer Punkt".
