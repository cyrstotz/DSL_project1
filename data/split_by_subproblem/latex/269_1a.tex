\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $s \left[\frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}\right]$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T \left[K\right]$. There are two curves on the graph:

1. The first curve starts at point 5, goes upwards and to the right, and ends at point 6. This curve is labeled as $P_5 = P_6$.
2. The second curve starts at point 6, goes upwards and to the right, and ends at point 7. This curve is labeled as $P_7 = P_8$.

There are arrows indicating the direction of the process along the curves. The points are connected by vertical lines indicating constant pressure processes.
