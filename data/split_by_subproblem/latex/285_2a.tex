    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as $T/k$ and the x-axis labeled as $s/kJ$. The graph contains two curves, one starting from point $P_0$ and ending at point $P_5$. There are intermediate points labeled $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$. The curve from $P_0$ to $P_5$ is concave upwards. There is also a straight line connecting points $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$.
