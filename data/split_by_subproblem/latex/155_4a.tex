\textbf{Description of the graph:}

The graph is a 2D plot with the x-axis labeled as \( T \, [K] \) and the y-axis labeled as \( P \, [bar] \). The plot consists of a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The points are connected by straight lines forming a quadrilateral. 

- Point 1 is at the top left.
- Point 2 is at the top right.
- Point 3 is at the bottom right.
- Point 4 is at the bottom left.

There are arrows indicating the direction of the process, starting from point 4, moving to point 1, then to point 2, followed by point 3, and finally back to point 4.
