    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a $T$-$s$ diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s$ and the y-axis is labeled $T$. There are two curves, one starting from point $O$ and curving upwards to the right, and another starting from point $O$ and curving upwards to the left. The points $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ are marked on the graph. The path follows from $O$ to $1$, then vertically up to $2$, then diagonally up to $3$, horizontally to $4$, diagonally down to $5$, and finally vertically down to $6$. The points $p_1$ and $p_2$ are marked on the upper curve, and $p_0$ is marked on the lower curve.
