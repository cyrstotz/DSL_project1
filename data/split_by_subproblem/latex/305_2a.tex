    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a $T$-$s$ diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s$ and the y-axis is labeled $T$. There are several lines drawn on the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A line starting from point $O$ and moving upwards to the right, labeled $1_3$.
        \item A line starting from point $1_3$ and moving upwards to the right, labeled $1$.
        \item A line starting from point $1$ and moving upwards to the right, labeled $2$.
        \item A line starting from point $O$ and moving upwards to the left, labeled $2_3$.
        \item A line starting from point $2_3$ and moving upwards to the left, labeled $2_k$.
        \item A line starting from point $2_k$ and moving upwards to the left, labeled $2$.
        \item Several isochore lines are drawn parallel to each other, labeled "isochore".
        \item A line labeled $0.13 \text{ bar}$ is drawn parallel to the isochore lines.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[Graph 2:] The graph is a $T$-$s$ diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s$ and the y-axis is labeled $T$. There are several lines drawn on the graph:

        \item A line starting from point $1$ and moving upwards to the right, labeled $2$.
        \item A line starting from point $O$ and moving upwards to the left, labeled $2_3$.
        \item A line starting from point $2_3$ and moving upwards to the left, labeled $2_k$.
        \item A line starting from point $2_k$ and moving upwards to the left, labeled $2$.
        \item Several isochore lines are drawn parallel to each other, labeled "isochore".
        \item A line labeled $0.019 \text{ bar}$ is drawn parallel to the isochore lines.
