\text{Graph description:} \\
\text{The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The y-axis is labeled } T \left[ \frac{K}{\text{J}} \right] \text{ and the x-axis is labeled } S \left[ \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg K}} \right]. \\
\text{There are several isobaric lines labeled } p = p_0, p = p_1, p = p_2 \text{ from bottom to top.} \\
\text{The process starts at point O, moves to point 1, then to point 2, and finally to point 3.} \\
\text{From point 3, it moves to point 4, then to point 5, and finally back to point O.} \\
\text{The lines connecting these points are curved, indicating non-linear processes.}
