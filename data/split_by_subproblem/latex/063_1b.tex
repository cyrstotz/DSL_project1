\[
T = - \frac{\int_{s_1}^{s_2} T ds}{s_1 - s_2} = \frac{h_a - h_e}{s_a - s_e} = \frac{L \left( T_a - T_e \right)}{L \ln \left( \frac{T_a}{T_e} \right)}
\]

\[
\int_{e}^{e} T ds = q
\]

\[
1HS: q = h_{a} - h_{e}
\]

\[
= \frac{298.15 K - 288.15 K}{\ln \left( \frac{298.15 K}{288.15 K} \right)}
\]

\[
= 293.12 K

- The top right corner is labeled as $100^\circ$.
- The bottom left corner is labeled as $298.15$.
- The bottom right corner is labeled as $298.15$.
- There is a horizontal line in the middle of the rectangle labeled as $100^\circ$.
- An arrow pointing to the right in the middle of the rectangle is labeled as $Q_{zu}$.
- An arrow pointing downwards from the middle of the rectangle is labeled as $min$.
