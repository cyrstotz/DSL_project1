    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a T-S diagram with the x-axis labeled as $S \, [\text{kJ/kgK}]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T$. There are two isobars labeled as $p_0 = p_6$ and $p_4 = p_5$. The graph contains several points labeled from 0 to 6, connected by lines indicating different processes. The points are connected as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 0 to Point 1: Isobare
        \item Point 1 to Point 2: Isobare
        \item Point 2 to Point 3: Isobare
        \item Point 3 to Point 4: Isobare
        \item Point 4 to Point 5: Isobare
        \item Point 5 to Point 6: Isobare
    \end{itemize}
    The graph also includes arrows indicating the direction of the processes.
