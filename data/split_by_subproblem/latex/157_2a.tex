\begin{itemize}
    \item The first graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram.
    \item The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) (K) and the horizontal axis is labeled \( S \) \(\left(\frac{J}{kgK}\right)\).
    \item There are three isotherms drawn, each labeled with a different temperature.
    \item The lowest isotherm is labeled \( T_0 \).
    \item There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    \item The process path starts at point 1, moves to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 4.
    \item The path from point 1 to point 2 is a vertical line, indicating an isothermal process.
    \item The path from point 2 to point 3 is a diagonal line, indicating an adiabatic process.
    \item The path from point 3 to point 4 is a horizontal line, indicating an isentropic process.
