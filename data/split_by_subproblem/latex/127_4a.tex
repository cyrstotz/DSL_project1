\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a pressure-volume (p-v) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( v \) and the y-axis is labeled \( p \). There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The process from 1 to 2 is an isobaric process (constant pressure), represented by a horizontal line. The process from 2 to 3 is an isobaric process, also represented by a horizontal line. The process from 3 to 4 is an isobaric process, represented by a horizontal line. The process from 4 to 1 is an isobaric process, represented by a horizontal line. There is a dome-shaped curve labeled "ND" connecting points 1 and 4. The arrows indicate the direction of the processes.
