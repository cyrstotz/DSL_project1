\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( T \) in units of \( [K] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( s \) in units of \( \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \). 

There are three isobaric lines labeled as follows:
- The topmost isobar is labeled \( \text{isobar @ } p_3 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).
- The middle isobar is labeled \( \text{isobar @ } p_2 \).
- The bottom isobar is labeled \( \text{isobar @ } p_0 = 0.797 \, \text{bar} \).

The graph contains six points labeled 0 through 6, connected by arrows indicating the direction of processes:
- Point 0 is at the bottom left.
- Point 1 is above and to the right of point 0.
- Point 2 is above and to the right of point 1, on the middle isobar.
- Point 3 is above and to the right of point 2, on the top isobar.
- Point 4 is to the right of point 3, connected by a dashed line.
- Point 5 is below point 4, on the middle isobar.
- Point 6 is below point 5, on the bottom isobar.
