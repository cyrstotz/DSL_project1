\textbf{Verbal Description of the Graph:}

The graph is a pressure-volume (p-V) diagram with the y-axis labeled as \( p \) in bar and the x-axis labeled as \( T \) in Kelvin. The graph shows a closed cycle with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The cycle starts at point 1, moves to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 4 before returning to point 1. The path from point 1 to point 2 and from point 3 to point 4 is a straight line, indicating an isobaric process at 8 bar. The path from point 2 to point 3 and from point 4 to point 1 is curved, indicating an isothermal process. The maximum pressure reached in the cycle is 150 bar.
