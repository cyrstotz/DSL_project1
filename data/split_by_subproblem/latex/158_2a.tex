\[
T \, [K]
\]

Graph description: The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( T \, [K] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( s \, \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \). There is a curve starting from point 1, moving to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 4. The segment from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "isentrop".
