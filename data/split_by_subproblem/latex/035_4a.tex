\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p[\text{bar}] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T[\text{K}] \). The plot shows a wavy line that starts from the bottom left, rises and falls multiple times, and ends at the bottom right. There is also a shaded region in the upper left corner of the graph.
\end{description}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[1-2:] \( T \uparrow \), \( p \downarrow \)
    \item[2-3:] \( S_2 = S_3 \), \( p \uparrow \)
    \item[3-4:] isobar, \( T \uparrow \), \( p = \text{const.} \)
    \item[4-1:] isenthalpe, \( h_4 = h_1 \), \( p \downarrow \), \( T = \text{const.} \)
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 2:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p[\text{bar}] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T[\text{K}] \). The plot shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The path from point 1 to point 2 is curved and labeled \( T = \text{const} \). The path from point 2 to point 3 is straight and labeled \( p = \text{const} \). The path from point 3 to point 4 is curved and labeled \( T = \text{const} \). The path from point 4 to point 1 is straight and labeled \( p = \text{const} \).
