\subsection*{a) T-s-Diagramm}

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a T-s diagram with the y-axis labeled as $T [K]$ and the x-axis labeled as $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right]$. The graph contains several curves and points labeled from 0 to 6. The points are connected by lines indicating different processes. The points are labeled as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 0 is at the bottom left.
        \item Point 1 is directly above point 0.
        \item Point 2 is above point 1, with a vertical line connecting them.
        \item Point 3 is to the right of point 2, connected by a curve.
        \item Point 4 is below point 3, connected by a vertical line.
        \item Point 5 is to the right of point 4, connected by a curve.
        \item Point 6 is below point 5, connected by a vertical line.
    \end{itemize}
    The graph also includes annotations such as $p_2 = p_3$, $0.5 \text{ bar}$, and $1.5$.
