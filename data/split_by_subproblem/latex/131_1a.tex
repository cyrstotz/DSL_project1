\subsection*{a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as $s \left[ \frac{Q}{T} \right] = \left[ \frac{J}{K} \right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[ K \right]$.
    \item There is a curve starting from point 1, labeled as "isotherm", moving to point 2.
    \item From point 2, the curve moves to point 3, labeled as "isobare".
    \item From point 3, the curve moves to point 4, labeled as "adiabat, isentrop".
    \item From point 4, the curve moves to point 5, labeled as "isotherm".
    \item From point 5, the curve moves to point 6, labeled as "isobare".
    \item There is a small diagram near point 1 showing a piston mechanism.
