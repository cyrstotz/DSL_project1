    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a phase diagram with the y-axis labeled as "p" and the x-axis labeled as "T [°C]". The y-axis represents pressure and the x-axis represents temperature. The graph shows three regions labeled "solid", "liquid", and "gas". There are three points labeled "1", "2", and "3". Point "1" is in the liquid region, point "2" is in the solid region, and point "3" is in the gas region. There is a line connecting points "1" and "2" labeled "isobar", and a line connecting points "2" and "3" labeled "isotherm". The line separating the solid and liquid regions is labeled "Schmelzlinie", and the line separating the liquid and gas regions is labeled "Siedelinie".
