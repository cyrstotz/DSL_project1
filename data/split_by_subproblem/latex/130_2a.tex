\begin{equation*}
\dot{m}_{\text{jos}} \left( h_e - h_a + \frac{1}{2} w_s^2 - \frac{1}{2} w_e^2 \right) = 0
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
h_a = h_e = c_p (T_e - T_s) = 1.006 \cdot (T_e - T_s)
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
T_s = T_0 = 0.1 \text{ bar}
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{Graph Description}

The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as \( s \left( \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right) \) and the y-axis labeled as \( T (K) \). The plot contains several curves and points:

- There are two dashed curves that represent isentropic processes.
- There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The points are connected by solid lines in the following manner:
  - Point 0 to Point 1
  - Point 1 to Point 2
  - Point 2 to Point 3
  - Point 3 to Point 4
  - Point 4 to Point 5
  - Point 5 to Point 6

The points and lines form a closed loop, indicating a thermodynamic cycle.
