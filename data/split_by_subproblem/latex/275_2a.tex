\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] 
    The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \left[\frac{kJ}{kg\,K}\right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \left[K\right]$. The graph contains several curves and points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by lines indicating different processes. There are isobars and isotherms drawn, with one isobar labeled $p_0$.
    
    \item[Graph 2:] 
    The graph is another Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \left[\frac{kJ}{kg\,K}\right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \left[K\right]$. The graph contains several curves and points labeled 2 through 6. The points are connected by lines indicating different processes. There are isobars and isotherms drawn, with one isobar labeled $0{,}5\,bar$.
