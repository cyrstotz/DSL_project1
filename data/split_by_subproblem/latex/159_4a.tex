    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $T$ and the y-axis labeled as $p$. There are two horizontal dashed lines, one at $p = 5 \text{mbar}$ and another at $p = 0.9 \text{mbar}$. There are two points labeled (i) and (ii) on the graph. Point (i) is located at a higher temperature and pressure, while point (ii) is at a lower temperature and pressure. The graph shows a series of curves connecting these points, indicating some thermodynamic process.
    \item[Graph 2:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $T$ and the y-axis labeled as $p$. There is a single line starting from the origin and moving upwards to the right, indicating a linear relationship. There are two points labeled (i) and (ii) on the line, with point (i) at a higher temperature and pressure, and point (ii) at a lower temperature and pressure.
