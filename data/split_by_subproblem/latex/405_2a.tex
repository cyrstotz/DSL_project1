\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled \( T(\text{K}) \) and the horizontal axis is labeled \( s \left( \frac{J}{\text{kgK}} \right) \). The graph consists of several points and lines connecting them:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point \( O \) is at the origin.
        \item A curved line goes from point \( O \) upwards to point \( 1 \).
        \item A straight line goes from point \( 1 \) upwards to point \( P_2 \).
        \item A straight line goes from point \( P_2 \) downwards to point \( G \).
        \item A straight line goes from point \( G \) downwards to point \( S \).
        \item A straight line goes from point \( S \) downwards to point \( 6 \).
        \item A straight line goes from point \( 6 \) downwards to point \( P_0 \).
    \end{itemize}
