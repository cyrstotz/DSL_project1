\begin{itemize}
    \item A diagram of a device is drawn, labeled "Adiabot".
    \item The device is enclosed in a dashed rectangle.
    \item There are two arrows pointing into the device from the left and right, and one arrow pointing out from the top.
    \item The left arrow is labeled with \(\dot{m}\).
    \item The right arrow is labeled with \(\dot{m} - \dot{m}_v\).
    \item The top arrow is labeled with \(A = 77\).
    \item The temperature \(T_4 = T(8 \text{bar}) = 31.33^\circ C\) is marked.
    \item The pressure \(p = 8 \text{bar}\) is marked.
