    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $s \, [\frac{J}{\mu s K}]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \, [K]$. There are three curves labeled $p_0$, $p_A$, and $p_2$. The graph contains six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The points are connected by lines in the following order: 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6. Points 0, 1, and 6 are on the $p_0$ curve, points 2 and 5 are on the $p_A$ curve, and points 3 and 4 are on the $p_2$ curve.
