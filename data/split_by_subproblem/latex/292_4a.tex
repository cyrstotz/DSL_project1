\textbf{Graph Description:}

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \) (bar) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \) (Â°C). There are several curves and lines drawn on the graph:

- A curve labeled "isobar 1" starting from the lower left and moving upwards to the right.
- Another curve labeled "isobar 2" starting from the lower left and moving upwards to the right, parallel to the first curve.
- A horizontal line labeled "150 bar" intersecting the second curve.
- A vertical line labeled "tripel" intersecting the horizontal line.
- A point labeled "5" at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines.
