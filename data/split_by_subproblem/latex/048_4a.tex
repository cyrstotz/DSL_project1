\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as $T$ (°C) and the y-axis labeled as $p$ (bar).
    \item The graph shows three distinct regions labeled as "Eis" (Ice), "Flüssig" (Liquid), and "Gas" (Gas).
    \item There is a line separating the "Eis" and "Flüssig" regions, and another line separating the "Flüssig" and "Gas" regions.
    \item The intersection of these lines is labeled as "Tripelpunkt" (Triple Point).
    \item A point on the "Eis" to "Flüssig" line is labeled as "T".
    \item Another point on the "Flüssig" to "Gas" line is labeled as "Z".
\end{itemize}
