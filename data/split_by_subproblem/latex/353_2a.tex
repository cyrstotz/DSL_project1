    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $S \left[ \frac{kJ}{K} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \left[ K \right]$. There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The points are connected by lines forming a cycle. The points 0 and 1 are connected by a horizontal line. The points 1 and 2 are connected by a vertical line. The points 2 and 3 are connected by a line with a positive slope. The points 3 and 4 are connected by a horizontal line. The points 4 and 5 are connected by a line with a negative slope. The points 5 and 6 are connected by a vertical line. The points 6 and 0 are connected by a horizontal line. There are two isobars labeled 0.5 BAR and 0.491 BAR. The temperatures 431.8 K and 243.15 K are marked with horizontal dashed lines.
