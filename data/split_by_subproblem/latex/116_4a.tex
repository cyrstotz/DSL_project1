    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The y-axis is labeled with "P" and the x-axis is labeled with "T". The graph contains a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isobar", the path from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isentrop", the path from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "isobar", and the path from point 4 to point 1 is labeled "isenthalp". The pressure at points 1 and 4 is labeled as "3 bar" and the pressure at points 2 and 3 is labeled as "8 bar".
