\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled $p[\text{bar}]$ and the x-axis labeled $T[K]$.
    \item The curve starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls back down to the bottom right.
    \item There are four points marked on the curve: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Point 1 is at the bottom left.
            \item Point 2 is at the bottom right.
            \item Point 3 is at the top right.
            \item Point 4 is at the top left.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Arrows indicate a cycle moving from point 1 to point 4, then to point 3, then to point 2, and back to point 1.
