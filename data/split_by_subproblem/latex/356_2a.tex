    \item[Graph:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) with units in brackets \([U]\). The horizontal axis is labeled \( S \) with units in brackets \([S]\). The graph contains several curves and points:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 0 at the bottom left.
        \item Point 1 directly above point 0, labeled "isentrop".
        \item Point 2 to the right of point 1, labeled "isentrop".
        \item Point 3 above point 2, labeled "adiabat + irreversibel".
        \item Point 4 to the left of point 3, labeled "isobar".
        \item Point 5 below point 4, labeled "isobar".
        \item Point 6 below point 5, labeled "isentrop".
    \end{itemize}
    The points are connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An arrow from point 0 to point 1.
        \item An arrow from point 1 to point 2.
        \item An arrow from point 2 to point 3.
        \item An arrow from point 3 to point 4.
        \item An arrow from point 4 to point 5.
        \item An arrow from point 5 to point 6.
    \end{itemize}
    The temperature at point 0 is marked as 243.15.
