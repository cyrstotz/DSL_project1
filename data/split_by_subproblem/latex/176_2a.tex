\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram.
    \item The y-axis is labeled as $T \, [K]$.
    \item The x-axis is labeled as $S \, [\frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}]$.
    \item The graph starts at point $O$ at $243.15 \, K$ on the y-axis.
    \item From point $O$, a vertical line goes up to point $1$.
    \item From point $1$, a line goes to the right and slightly up to point $2$.
    \item From point $2$, a line goes up to point $3$.
    \item From point $3$, a line goes down to point $4$ labeled as "adiabate".
    \item From point $4$, a line goes down to point $5$ labeled as "Mischung isentrope".
    \item From point $5$, a line goes down to point $6$.
    \item From point $6$, a line goes back to point $O$ labeled as "isotherm".
    \item There is a dashed line from point $O$ to point $6$ labeled as $P_0/P_6$.
