\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The horizontal axis is labeled with an arrow pointing to the right, and the vertical axis is labeled with an arrow pointing upwards. There are six points labeled \( P1 \) to \( P6 \) on the graph. The points \( P2 \) and \( P3 \) are at the same vertical level. The point \( P4 \) is above \( P3 \), and \( P5 \) is above \( P4 \). The point \( P6 \) is below \( P5 \) and to the right of \( P1 \). There is a curved line connecting \( P1 \) to \( P6 \) passing through \( P2 \), \( P3 \), \( P4 \), and \( P5 \). There is also a straight line labeled "richtlinie" connecting \( P1 \) to \( P6 \). The region between the curved line and the straight line is shaded.

\[
E_{1, \text{reel}} = T_0 \cdot \dot{S}_{e12}
\]

\[
0 = m \left[ S_e - S_a \right] + \frac{Q_B}{T_B} + \int \dot{S}_{e12}
\]

\[
\frac{\dot{S}_{e12}}{m} = S_a - S_e - \frac{Q_B}{T_B} = \int_{T_2}^{T_3} \frac{c_p}{T} dT - R \ln \left( \frac{P_B^2}{P_2} \right)
\]

\[
= c_p \ln \frac{T_3}{T_B} - \frac{Q_B}{T_B} = -1295.81 \frac{kJ}{K}
\]

\[
\dot{E}_{1, \text{reel}} = 243.13 \frac{kJ}{K} \cdot -1295.81 \frac{kJ}{K} = 315076.20 \text{ kJ}
\]
