        \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as $T \, [K]$ and the x-axis labeled as $s \, [kJ/kg \cdot K]$. The plot starts at point 0, then moves to point 1, then to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 4. The curve from point 3 to point 4 is a downward curve. There is a shaded area under the curve from point 3 to point 4.
