\textbf{Verbal Description of the Graph:}

The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \) and the horizontal axis is labeled \( S \, \left[ \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} \right] \). 

There are six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected as follows:
- Point 1 is connected to Point 2 with a vertical line.
- Point 2 is connected to Point 3 with a line that slopes upwards to the right.
- Point 3 is connected to Point 4 with a horizontal line.
- Point 4 is connected to Point 5 with a line that slopes downwards to the right.
- Point 5 is connected to Point 6 with a vertical line.
- Point 6 is connected to Point 1 with a curved line.

The points are positioned such that:
- \( S_1 = S_2 \)
- \( S_5 = S_6 \)

The pressures at various points are indicated as:
- \( P_2 = P_3 \)
- \( P_4 = P_5 = P_1 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)
- \( P_0 = P_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)
