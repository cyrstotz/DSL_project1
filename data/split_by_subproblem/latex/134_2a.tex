\textbf{Graph Description:}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The y-axis is labeled \( T [^\circ C] \) and ranges from 30 upwards. The x-axis is labeled \( S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \) and ranges from 0 to the right. 

There are six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected as follows:
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.
- Point 2 is above point 1.
- Point 3 is to the right of point 2.
- Point 4 is above point 3.
- Point 5 is to the right of point 4.
- Point 6 is below point 5.

The path from point 1 to point 2 is a vertical line labeled "isentrope". The path from point 2 to point 3 is a horizontal line labeled "isobare". The path from point 3 to point 4 is a vertical line labeled "isentrope". The path from point 4 to point 5 is a horizontal line labeled "isobare". The path from point 5 to point 6 is a vertical line labeled "isentrope".

There is a label "IG - Luft" near the top of the graph, and another label "isobare ps = pu" near the top right.
