\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram.
    \item The x-axis is labeled \( S \left( \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right) \).
    \item The y-axis is labeled \( T(K) \).
    \item There are two isobars labeled \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) with \( P_2 > P_1 \).
    \item The process starts at a point on the lower isobar \( P_1 \), moves vertically up to the upper isobar \( P_2 \) through a process labeled "Verdichter".
    \item From the upper isobar \( P_2 \), the process moves rightward and slightly downward through a process labeled "isobare WÃ¤rmezufuhr".
    \item The process then moves downward to the lower isobar \( P_1 \) through a process labeled "Turbine".
    \item Finally, the process moves leftward and slightly downward back to the starting point on the lower isobar \( P_1 \) through a process labeled "T=const".
\end{itemize}
