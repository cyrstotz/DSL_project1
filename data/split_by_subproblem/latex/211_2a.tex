\textbf{Graph Description:} \\
The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}}]$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T \, [\text{K}]$. The graph shows a cycle with four points labeled as $p_0$, $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$. The process from $p_0$ to $p_1$ is labeled as "isentrop", from $p_1$ to $p_2$ as "isobar", from $p_2$ to $p_3$ as "isentrop", and from $p_3$ to $p_0$ as "isobar". The cycle is clockwise. The region below the cycle is labeled as "antropic".
