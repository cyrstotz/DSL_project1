    \item[Graph:] 
    The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[ K \right]$. The graph contains several points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected by lines. The points are connected in the following order: 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4. There are also three curves labeled as "isotherm", "isobar", and "isochore". The point 0 is at the origin. The point 1 is slightly above and to the right of point 0. The point 2 is above and to the right of point 1. The point 3 is above and to the right of point 2. The point 4 is below and to the right of point 3.

\subsection*{Interpolation formula:}

\[
Y = Y_1 + \frac{Y_2 - Y_1}{X_2 - X_1} (x - X_1)
