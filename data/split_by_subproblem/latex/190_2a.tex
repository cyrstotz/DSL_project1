\textbf{Verbal Description of the Graph:}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \) and the y-axis is labeled \( T \). There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The points are connected by curves and lines as follows:

- Point 0 is at the origin.
- Point 1 is above point 0, connected by a vertical line.
- Point 2 is to the right of point 1, connected by a curve.
- Point 3 is above point 2, connected by a vertical line.
- Point 4 is to the left of point 3, connected by a curve.
- Point 5 is below point 4, connected by a vertical line.

There are also dashed lines indicating isobars \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) running parallel to the x-axis.
