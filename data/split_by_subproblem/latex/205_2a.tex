    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( T \, [K] \) and the x-axis labeled as \( s \, [\frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}] \). The graph contains two curves, each with arrows indicating the direction of the process. The first curve starts at point 1, moves to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 4. The second curve starts at point 5 and moves to point 6. The points are connected by lines, and the points are labeled sequentially. There are pressure annotations at points 4 and 6, with 0.5 bar at point 4 and 0.15 bar at point 6.
