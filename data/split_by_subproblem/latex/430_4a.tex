\section*{Problem 9a}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a pressure-volume diagram with the x-axis labeled \( V [L] \) and the y-axis labeled \( p [\text{bar}] \).
    \item The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    \item Point 1 is at the bottom left, labeled "Flüssig".
    \item Point 2 is at the bottom right, labeled "Nassdampf".
    \item Point 3 is at the top right, labeled "trocken".
    \item Point 4 is at the top left, labeled "überhitzter Dampf".
    \item The curve from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isotherm".
    \item The curve from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isotherm".
    \item The curve from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "isotherm".
    \item The curve from point 4 to point 1 is labeled "isotherm".
\end{itemize}
