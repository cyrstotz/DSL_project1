    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $V$ and the y-axis is labeled $p$. There are several curves and lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A straight line labeled $2$ starting from the origin and extending diagonally upwards to the right.
        \item A curve labeled $P_0$ starting from the bottom left and curving upwards to the right.
        \item Another curve labeled $P_2$ above $P_0$.
        \item A point labeled $1$ on the $P_0$ curve.
        \item A point labeled $2$ on the $P_2$ curve.
        \item A vertical dashed line connecting points $1$ and $2$.
        \item A point labeled $3$ on the $P_2$ curve, above point $2$.
        \item A point labeled $4$ on the $P_2$ curve, above point $3$.
        \item A point labeled $5$ on the $P_2$ curve, above point $4$.
        \item A horizontal dashed line connecting points $3$, $4$, and $5$.
        \item The word "isobar" written near the top right of the graph.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[Graph 2:] The graph is a Temperature-Volume (T-V) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $V$ and the y-axis is labeled $T$. There are several curves and lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A curve labeled $P_0$ starting from the bottom left and curving upwards to the right.
        \item Another curve labeled $P_2$ above $P_0$.
        \item A curve labeled $P_5$ above $P_2$.
        \item A point labeled $1$ on the $P_0$ curve.
        \item A point labeled $2$ on the $P_2$ curve.
        \item A point labeled $3$ on the $P_2$ curve, above point $2$.
        \item A point labeled $4$ on the $P_2$ curve, above point $3$.
        \item A point labeled $5$ on the $P_5$ curve, above point $4$.
        \item A vertical dashed line connecting points $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$.
        \item A point labeled $6$ on the $P_0$ curve, below point $1$.
        \item A horizontal dashed line connecting points $1$ and $6$.
    \end{itemize}
