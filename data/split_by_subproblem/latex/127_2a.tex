    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram with the y-axis labeled as $p$ and the x-axis labeled as $v$. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 25, and the x-axis has no specific numerical values marked. There are several curves on the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Three isobaric lines labeled as $p_0$, $p_5$, and $p_{213}$ from left to right.
        \item Two isentropic lines labeled as "isentrop" running vertically.
        \item Six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, connected by lines to form a cycle.
        \item The points are connected as follows: 0 to 1 (vertical line), 1 to 2 (diagonal line), 2 to 3 (vertical line), 3 to 4 (diagonal line), 4 to 5 (vertical line), and 5 to 6 (diagonal line).
    \end{itemize}
