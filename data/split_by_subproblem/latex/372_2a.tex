\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( T \left[ \frac{C}{J} \right] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg} \right] \). The graph contains a closed loop with six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected as follows:

- Point 1 is connected to Point 2 with a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 2 is connected to Point 3 with a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 3 is connected to Point 4 with a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 4 is connected to Point 5 with a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 5 is connected to Point 6 with a line labeled "isobar".
- Point 6 is connected back to Point 1 with a line labeled "isobar".

The points are also labeled with pressures:
- \( P_3 = P_2 \)
- \( P_4 = P_5 \)
- \( P_6 = P_6 \)
