    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \left[ K \right]$. The graph contains a closed loop with six points labeled 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The process from point 0 to point 2 is an isobaric process. The process from point 2 to point 3 is an isobaric process. The process from point 3 to point 4 is an isobaric process. The process from point 4 to point 5 is an isobaric process. The process from point 5 to point 6 is an isobaric process. The process from point 6 to point 0 is an isobaric process. The pressure at point 5 is labeled $P_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}$ and the pressure at point 6 is labeled $P_6 = P_0 - 0.1 \, \text{bar}$.
