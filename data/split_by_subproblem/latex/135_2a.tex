\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (s) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) and the horizontal axis is labeled \( s \). The graph consists of a cycle with six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by lines and curves as follows:

- Point 1 is at the bottom left.
- Point 2 is directly above point 1, connected by a vertical line labeled \( p = 2 \, \text{bar} \).
- Point 3 is to the right of point 2, connected by a curve.
- Point 4 is below point 3, connected by a vertical line.
- Point 5 is to the right of point 4, connected by a curve labeled \( \text{isobare mit} \, 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).
- Point 6 is below point 5, connected by a vertical line labeled \( \text{isobare} \, p = 0.79 \, \text{bar} \).
- Point 6 is connected back to point 1 by a curve.
