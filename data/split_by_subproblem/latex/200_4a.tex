    \item[Graph 1:] A wavy line is drawn, labeled "Phasendiagramm" at the top. The x-axis is labeled "T (째C)" and the y-axis is labeled "P (mbar)". The graph is divided into three regions: "Fest" on the left, "isobar" in the middle, and "Fl체ssig" on the right.
    \item[Graph 2:] A phase diagram with a curved line starting from the bottom left and rising to the right. The x-axis is labeled "T (째C)" and the y-axis is labeled "P (mbar)". The diagram is divided into three regions: "Fest" on the left, "Fl체ssig" on the right, and "Gas" above the curved line. There are three points marked: point 1 on the right, point 2 in the middle, and point 3 on the left. Point 1 and point 2 are connected by a horizontal line labeled "isobar". Point 2 and point 3 are connected by a vertical line labeled "isotherm". The pressure at point 3 is labeled "5 mbar" and the temperature at point 3 is labeled "10 K".
