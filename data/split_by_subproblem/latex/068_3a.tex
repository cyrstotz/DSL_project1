\textbf{Graph Description:}

The graph is a simple Cartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis (x-axis) is labeled with the letter "T" at the far right end, indicating temperature. The vertical axis (y-axis) is labeled with the letter "P" at the top, indicating pressure. Both axes have arrows at their ends pointing in the positive direction. The origin of the graph is at the bottom left corner where the two axes intersect.
