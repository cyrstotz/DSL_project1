Graph Description:
- The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled "s [kJ/kg*K]" and the y-axis labeled "[°C] T".
- There are six points labeled 1 through 6.
- Point 1 is at the origin.
- Point 2 is slightly above and to the right of point 1, connected by a curve labeled "isentrop".
- Point 3 is above point 2, connected by a vertical line labeled "isobar".
- Point 4 is to the right of point 3, connected by a horizontal line labeled "isotherm".
- Point 5 is above point 4, connected by a vertical line labeled "isobar".
- Point 6 is to the right of point 5, connected by a horizontal line labeled "isotherm".
- The graph is labeled "Scale 3/7" on the top right.

\[
\Delta e_{xver} = T_0 \cdot s_{ver}
\]

\[
0 = \dot{m} (s_0 - s_6) + \frac{Q}{T_j} + s_{ver}
\]

\[
s_{ver} = \dot{m} (s_c - s_0)
\]

\[
s_{ver} = \dot{m} \cdot cp \cdot \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \cdot \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_1} \right)
\]

\[
\frac{s_{ver}}{\dot{m}} = 1.006 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{340K}{253.15K} \right) = 0.337727 \frac{kJ}{k}
\]

\[
e_x = T_0 \cdot s_{ver} = (-301273.15) \cdot 0.337727 \frac{kJ}{k}
\]

\[
= 82,003 kJ
