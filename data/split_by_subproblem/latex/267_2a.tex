\text{Graph description:} \\
\text{The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The y-axis is labeled } T[K] \text{ and the x-axis is labeled } s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right]. \\
\text{There are six points labeled 1 to 6. The points are connected by lines forming a closed loop.} \\
\text{Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, point 4 is below point 3, point 5 is to the left of point 4, and point 6 is to the left of point 5.} \\
\text{There are three dashed lines labeled } p = p_0, p = p_2, \text{ and } p = p_3 \text{ from bottom to top.} \\
\text{There is a bypass arrow pointing from point 4 to point 6.}
