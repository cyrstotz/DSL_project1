\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a phase diagram with the y-axis labeled as "P" and the x-axis labeled as "T". There are three main regions labeled "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). The boundary between the solid and liquid regions is marked as "isotherm" (isothermal) and "isobar" (isobaric). The point where all three phases meet is labeled "TP" (triple point). An arrow labeled "water curves back" points to the boundary between the liquid and gas regions. Another arrow labeled "Steigt bei low (unter TP)" points to the boundary between the solid and liquid regions.
