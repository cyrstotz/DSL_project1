\textbf{Graph Description:}

The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( T \) [K] and the x-axis labeled as \( S \) \(\left[ \frac{h_2}{kg_k} \right]\). The graph contains six points labeled from 0 to 6. The points are connected by lines to form a cycle. The connections are as follows:

- Point 0 to Point 1
- Point 1 to Point 2
- Point 2 to Point 3
- Point 3 to Point 4
- Point 4 to Point 5
- Point 5 to Point 6
- Point 6 to Point 0

There are three isobaric processes indicated:
- From Point 2 to Point 3 labeled as "isobare bei \( p_3 = p_2 \)"
- From Point 4 to Point 5 labeled as "isobare bei \( p_4 = p_5 \)"
- From Point 6 to Point 0 labeled as "isobare bei \( p_1 = p_0 \)"
