\subsubsection*{Verbal Description of Graphs}

The first graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \). The graph shows a dome-shaped curve starting from the origin, rising to a peak, and then falling back down symmetrically.

The second graph is also a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \). There are several lines and points marked on this graph:
- A line labeled "4" starting from the lower left and moving upwards to the right.
- A line labeled "2" starting from the lower left and moving upwards to the right, parallel to the line labeled "4".
- A line labeled "g" starting from the lower left and moving upwards to the right, parallel to the other two lines.
- A point labeled "Tripel" where the lines converge.
- An arrow labeled "Mengegebiet" pointing upwards from the point "Tripel".
