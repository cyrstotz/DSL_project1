    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($P$-$T$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $T \, [K]$ and the y-axis is labeled $P \, [\text{bar}]$. There are four points labeled $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$ connected by arrows indicating a cycle. Point $1$ is at the bottom left, point $2$ is directly above point $1$, point $3$ is to the right of point $2$, and point $4$ is directly below point $3$. The cycle proceeds in the order $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 1$. The pressure at point $1$ is labeled as $5 \, \text{bar}$, and the temperature at point $3$ is labeled as $3i$.
