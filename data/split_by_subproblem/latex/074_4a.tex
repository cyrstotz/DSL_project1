\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as \( T \, (^\circ \text{C}) \) and the y-axis labeled as \( p \, (\text{mbar}) \).
    \item The graph shows a curve starting from the origin and increasing non-linearly.
    \item There are three points marked on the graph:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Point 1 is at the lower part of the curve.
            \item Point 2 is at the upper part of the curve, with a horizontal line extending to the right labeled as "isobar eingehen".
            \item Point 3 is below point 2, with a vertical line connecting points 2 and 3 labeled as "Tripelpunkt".
            \item The curve between points 1 and 3 is labeled as "isotherm".
        \end{itemize}
