\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( s \) with units \([ \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}} ]\). The y-axis is labeled \( T \) with units \([ \text{K} ]\). The graph contains several curves and lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are three isobaric curves labeled as "isobar".
        \item There are two isentropic curves labeled as "isentrop".
        \item The points are labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
        \item The process path is marked with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
        \item The points \( P_0 = P_6 \), \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), \( P_3 \), \( P_4 \), and \( P_5 \) are marked on the graph.
        \item The process path from point 4 to point 5 is marked with a zigzag line indicating a different process.
    \end{itemize}
