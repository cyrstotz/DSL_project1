\subsection*{a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as \( p \) and the x-axis labeled as \( T \).
    \item The graph shows a phase diagram with a curve starting from the origin and bending upwards to the right.
    \item There are three points marked on the graph:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Point 1 is on the right side of the curve, labeled as "Gas".
            \item Point 2 is on the curve, labeled as "isobar".
            \item Point 3 is below the curve, labeled as "Flüssig".
        \end{itemize}
    \item The curve is labeled as "isotherm" and "Tripel".
    \item There are arrows indicating transitions between the points:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An arrow from point 1 to point 2 labeled as "isobar".
            \item An arrow from point 2 to point 3 labeled as "isotherm".
        \end{itemize}
    \item The region above the curve is labeled as "Gas" and the region below the curve is labeled as "Flüssig".
\end{itemize}
