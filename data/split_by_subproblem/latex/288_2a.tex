\textbf{Description of the graph:} The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( T[K] \) and the x-axis labeled as \( S \left[ \frac{J}{kg \cdot K} \right] \). There are three curves on the graph, each representing different states. The first curve starts at point 0 and goes through points 1 and 6. The second curve starts at point 2 and goes through points 3 and 4.5. The third curve starts at point \( P_0 \) and goes through points \( P_1 \), \( P_5 \), and \( P_4 \). The points are connected with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
