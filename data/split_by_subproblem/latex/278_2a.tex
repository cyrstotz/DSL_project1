    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \left[ K \right]$. The graph consists of several curves and points:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 0 at the origin.
        \item A curve from point 0 to point 1 labeled "adiabatic".
        \item A curve from point 1 to point 2 labeled "isotherm".
        \item A curve from point 2 to point 3 labeled "isobar".
        \item A curve from point 3 to point 4 labeled "adiabatic, innere".
        \item A curve from point 4 to point 5 labeled "isotherm, isobar".
        \item A curve from point 5 to point 6 labeled "isentrop".
        \item The points 3, 4, and 5 are connected by a dashed line labeled $p_3 = p_2$.
        \item The points 4 and 6 are connected by a dashed line labeled $p_6 = p_0$.
    \end{itemize}
