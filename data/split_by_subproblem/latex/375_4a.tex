\begin{description}
    \item[Graph:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( p \) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T \). The plot shows a single peak, resembling a bell curve. The peak is located towards the center of the graph. There are three points marked on the curve: one at the left base labeled as \( 3 \), one at the peak labeled as \( 2 \), and one at the right base labeled as \( 1 \). There is a horizontal arrow pointing from point \( 3 \) to point \( 1 \), indicating a process or transition between these points. The word "adiabat" is written near the curve.
