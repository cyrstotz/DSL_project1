    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($P$-$T$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $T$ (Temperature) and the y-axis is labeled $P$ (Pressure). There is a curve starting from the origin and rising upwards to the right. Points 1, 2, and 3 are marked on the curve. Point 1 is at the lower left, point 2 is at the middle, and point 3 is at the upper right. There is a horizontal line labeled "isobar" connecting points 1 and 2. Another horizontal line labeled "isobar" connects points 2 and 3. There is a vertical line labeled "isotherm" connecting points 2 and 2'. Another vertical line labeled "isotherm" connects points 3 and 3'. The points 2' and 3' are on the curve.
