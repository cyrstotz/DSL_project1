    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The $y$-axis is labeled $p$ and ranges from 1 mbar to higher pressures. The $x$-axis is labeled $T$ and ranges from lower to higher temperatures. There is a curve starting from the lower left and moving upwards to the right, labeled "Tripel". There are three points marked on the graph: point 1 on the curve, point 2 above point 1 on a horizontal line labeled "Isobar", and point 3 below point 1 on a vertical line labeled "Isotherm". The temperature at point 1 is marked as $263.15K = T_i$.
