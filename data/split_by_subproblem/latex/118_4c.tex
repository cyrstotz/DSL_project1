\text{A horizontal line with the text "relative unit" is crossed out.}

\text{Below it, there is a horizontal line with arrows pointing to the right at both ends. Above the line, there are the following labels:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $h_3 - h_f$
    \item A-8
    \item 269.09 - 63.53
    \item 1.07
\end{itemize}

\text{Below the line, there are the following labels:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $h_g - h_f$
    \item $x_s$
    \item 255.05 - 63.53
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
x_1 &= \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} \quad \text{A-8}
\end{align*}
