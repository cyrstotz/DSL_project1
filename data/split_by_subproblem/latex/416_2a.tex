\textbf{Verbal Description of the Graph:}

The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $\eta \left[\frac{\dot{W}}{\dot{q}_{\text{in}}}\right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T (K)$. The graph contains a cycle with six points labeled 1 through 6. The cycle consists of the following segments:

- From point 1 to point 2: A vertical line labeled "isobar".
- From point 2 to point 3: A curved line labeled "isobar" and "p_2".
- From point 3 to point 4: A horizontal line labeled "isobar" and "p = 0.5 \text{ bar}".
- From point 4 to point 5: A curved line labeled "isobar" and "p_1".
- From point 5 to point 6: A vertical line labeled "isobar" and "p = 0.151 \text{ bar}".
- From point 6 to point 1: A curved line labeled "isobar".
