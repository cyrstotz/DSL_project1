    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram with the y-axis labeled as $p$ and the x-axis labeled as $V$. The graph consists of four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The process from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "Isotherm", the process from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "Isentrop", and the process from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "Isotherm". The process from point 4 to point 1 is labeled as "Isentrop". The point 2 is marked as "ND". The graph shows a cyclic process with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
