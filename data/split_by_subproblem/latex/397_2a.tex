    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a pressure-volume (p-v) diagram with the x-axis labeled as $s \, (\text{kJ}/\text{kg} \cdot \text{K})$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \, (\text{K})$. The graph consists of a closed loop with six points labeled 1 through 6. The process between points 1 and 2 is labeled as "adiabat s=konst reversibel". The process between points 2 and 3 is labeled as "isobar". The process between points 3 and 4 is labeled as "adiabat ir". The process between points 4 and 5 is labeled as "adiabat irreversibel". The process between points 5 and 6 is labeled as "isobar". The process between points 6 and 1 is labeled as "s=konst". The pressures at points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are labeled as $p_0 = p_6 = 0.1916 \, \text{bar}$, $p_2 = p_3$, and $p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}$.
