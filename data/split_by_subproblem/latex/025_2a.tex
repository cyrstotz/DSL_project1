\section*{Problem a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[ K \right]$.
    \item There are several curves and points labeled on the graph:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A curve labeled "Isobare von Zustand 1" starting from the bottom left and curving upwards to the right.
            \item A point labeled "0" at the beginning of the "Isobare von Zustand 1" curve.
            \item A point labeled "1" on the "Isobare von Zustand 1" curve.
            \item A point labeled "2" above point "1" with a vertical arrow pointing upwards from "1" to "2".
            \item A horizontal line from point "2" to point "3".
            \item A point labeled "3" at the end of the horizontal line.
            \item A curve labeled "Isobare von Zustand 4" starting from point "3" and curving upwards to the right.
            \item A point labeled "4" on the "Isobare von Zustand 4" curve.
            \item A point labeled "5" below point "4" with a vertical arrow pointing downwards from "4" to "5".
            \item A curve labeled "Isobare von Zustand 2" starting from point "5" and curving downwards to the left.
            \item A point labeled "6" on the "Isobare von Zustand 2" curve.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The graph also includes several isobars labeled as "Isobare Zustand 1", "Isobare Zustand 2", and "Isobare von Zustand 4".
\end{itemize}
