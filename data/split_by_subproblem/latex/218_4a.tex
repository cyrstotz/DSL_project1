    \item[Graph 1:] 
    The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $T$ and the y-axis is labeled $p$. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is directly above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, and point 4 is directly below point 3. The region between points 1, 2, 3, and 4 is shaded. There is a line connecting points 1 and 4, and another line connecting points 2 and 3. The point labeled "Tripel" is to the right of point 3.
    
    \item[Graph 2:] 
    The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $T$ and the y-axis is labeled $p$. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 forming a square. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is directly above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, and point 4 is directly below point 3. The point labeled "Tripel" is to the right of point 3.
