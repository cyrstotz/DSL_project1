    \item[Graph:] 
    The graph is a pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled $p$ (bar) and the horizontal axis is labeled $T$ (Â°C). There is a dome-shaped curve representing the phase boundary. Inside the dome, there are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is on the left side of the dome, point 2 is on the right side of the dome, point 3 is above point 2, and point 4 is above point 1. There are arrows indicating the transitions between these points: from 1 to 4, from 4 to 3, from 3 to 2, and from 2 to 1. The transition from 2 to 1 is labeled as "isobar".
