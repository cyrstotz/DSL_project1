\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a plot of \( p(\text{bar}) \) versus \( T(\text{K}) \). The curve starts at the bottom left, oscillates upwards and downwards several times, and ends at the bottom right. The points are labeled as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 is at the bottom left.
        \item Point 2 is slightly higher and to the right of Point 1.
        \item Point 3 is higher and to the right of Point 2.
        \item Point 4 is higher and to the right of Point 3.
        \item Point 5 is higher and to the right of Point 4.
        \item Point 6 is higher and to the right of Point 5.
    \end{itemize}
    The curve is labeled with "flüssig", "Nassdampf", and "Dampf" at different sections.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 2:] The graph is a plot of \( p(\text{bar}) \) versus \( T(\text{K}) \). The curve starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls back down. The points are labeled as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 is at the bottom left.
        \item Point 2 is higher and to the right of Point 1.
        \item Point 3 is higher and to the right of Point 2.
        \item Point 4 is at the peak, higher and to the right of Point 3.
    \end{itemize}
    The curve is labeled with "flüssig", "Nassdampf", and "Dampf" at different sections.
