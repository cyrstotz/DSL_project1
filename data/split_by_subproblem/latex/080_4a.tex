    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $v$ and the y-axis labeled as $p$. There are two isochore lines labeled as "isochore 1" and "isochore 2". The graph contains four points labeled (1), (2), (3), and (4). The points (1) and (2) are connected by a horizontal line, and points (3) and (4) are connected by another horizontal line. Points (2) and (3) are connected by a vertical line, and points (1) and (4) are connected by a curved line. The curved line represents a process path.
