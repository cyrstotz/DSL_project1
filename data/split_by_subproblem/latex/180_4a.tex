\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as \(P\) and the x-axis labeled as \(T\).
    \item There is a curve starting from the origin and rising upwards, labeled as "2-phase".
    \item Another curve starts from the top left and goes downwards, labeled as "triple".
    \item A horizontal line intersects the "2-phase" curve and is labeled as "sos".
    \item The point of intersection of the "sos" line and the "2-phase" curve is marked.
    \item The region below the "2-phase" curve is labeled as "fl√ºssig".
