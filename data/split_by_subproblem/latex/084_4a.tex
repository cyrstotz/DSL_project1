\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( p \) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T \). The graph starts at the origin and rises to a peak labeled as \( T_{max} \) (i). After reaching the peak, the graph descends and then rises again to a point labeled as (ii). The region under the initial rise is labeled as "Nassdampf". The graph then continues to the right, labeled as \( g.c.s \).
