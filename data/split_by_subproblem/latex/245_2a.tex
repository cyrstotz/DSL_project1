    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( T[K] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \). The graph contains a curve with several points marked and labeled as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 is at the bottom left.
        \item Point 2 is slightly above and to the right of Point 1.
        \item Point 3 is above Point 2, connected by a line labeled "isobar".
        \item Point 4/5 is to the right of Point 2, connected by a line labeled "adiabat, irrev.".
        \item Point 6 is to the right of Point 4/5, connected by a line labeled "adiabat, rev.".
        \item Point 0 is to the right of Point 6.
    \end{itemize}
