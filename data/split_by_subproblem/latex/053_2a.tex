\subsection*{a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as $S \left[ \frac{u}{kg} \right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[ K \right]$.
    \item Several curves are drawn, each representing different pressures.
    \item Points are labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    \item Point 1 is at the intersection of the lowest pressure curve and the y-axis.
    \item Point 2 is on the next higher pressure curve, connected to point 1 by a line labeled "reversibel".
    \item Point 3 is on the same pressure curve as point 2, connected by an isobaric line.
    \item Point 4 is on a higher pressure curve, connected to point 3 by a line labeled "reversibel".
    \item Point 5 is on the same pressure curve as point 4, connected by an isobaric line.
    \item Point 6 is on the lowest pressure curve, connected to point 5 by a line labeled "reversibel".
