    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The y-axis is labeled \(P (\text{bar})\) and the x-axis is labeled \(T (K)\). The graph shows a curve with two peaks, forming a closed loop. The curve starts at a lower point, rises to the first peak, then dips down to a valley, and rises again to the second peak before descending. There are three points marked on the curve: point 1 at the first peak, point 2 at the valley, and point 3 at the second peak. Arrows indicate transitions between these points: from point 1 to point 2, and from point 2 to point 3. There is a shaded area under the curve between points 1 and 2, labeled as region II. Another shaded area is between points 2 and 3, labeled as region I.
