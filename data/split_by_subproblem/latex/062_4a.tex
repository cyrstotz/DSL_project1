    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( P(v) \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( v \left( \frac{m^3}{kg} \right) \). The graph shows two curves. The first curve starts at the origin, rises steeply, reaches a peak, and then gradually decreases. The second curve starts at the origin, rises more gradually, intersects the first curve at its peak, and then continues to rise.
