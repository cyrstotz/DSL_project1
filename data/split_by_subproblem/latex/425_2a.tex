\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( S \) with units \([ \frac{J}{kg \cdot K} ]\). The y-axis is labeled \( T \) with units \([ K ]\). The graph contains a closed loop with six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by lines, some of which are straight and some are curved. The path follows the sequence 1-2-3-4-5-6-1. The region between points 3 and 4 is shaded. The following annotations are present:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( P_3 = P_2 \)
        \item \( P_1 = P_4 = P_5 \)
        \item \( P_6 \)
        \item \( \dot{Q}_{5,6} \)
        \item \( \dot{Q}_{5,1} \)
        \item \( \dot{Q}_{5,6} \)
        \item \( isobar \) (near the line connecting points 1 and 2)
        \item \( isentrop \) (near the line connecting points 5 and 6)
    \end{itemize}
