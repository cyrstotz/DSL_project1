    \item[Graphical Description:] 
    There is a closed loop diagram with four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. State 1 is at the top left, state 2 at the top right, state 3 at the bottom right, and state 4 at the bottom left. The loop is traversed in a clockwise direction. The temperature at state 1 is labeled "T_{zu} = 20^\circ C", and the temperature at state 2 is labeled "T_{zu} = 70^\circ C". The heat transfer from state 1 to state 2 is labeled "Q_{aus,12} = 37.10^{-3} \, \text{kJ}".

\Delta S = m_2 s_2 - m_1 s_1 = \Delta m_2 s_{zu} + \frac{Q_{aus}}{T} - \sum \frac{W_{zu}}{T} \quad \text{mit} \quad m_2 = m_1
