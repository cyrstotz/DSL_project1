\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as $T$ (temperature) and the horizontal axis labeled as $s$ (entropy). The graph contains a curve that starts at point 1, rises to point 3, then falls to point 4, rises again to point 5, and finally falls to point 6. The points are connected by smooth curves. The points are labeled as follows:
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.
- Point 3 is at the peak of the first rise.
- Point 4 is at the bottom of the first fall.
- Point 5 is at the peak of the second rise.
- Point 6 is at the bottom right.

The points 3, 4, and 5 are connected by vertical dashed lines indicating changes in state. The pressures at these points are labeled as:
- $P_2 = P_5$ at point 3.
- $P_4 = P_5$ at point 5.
- $P_0 = P_6$ at point 6.
