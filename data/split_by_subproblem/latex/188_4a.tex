    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $T$ (temperature) and the y-axis is labeled $p$ (pressure). There are three curves drawn on the graph. The leftmost curve is labeled $p_0$, the middle curve is labeled $p_1$, and the rightmost curve is labeled $p_2$. The middle curve has a dome-shaped region in the middle, representing the phase change region. The top of the dome touches the middle curve, and the bottom of the dome touches the x-axis. The curves have a wavy pattern indicating the phase boundaries.
