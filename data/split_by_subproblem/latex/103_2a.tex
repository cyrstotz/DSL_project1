a) 

The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as \( S \) and the y-axis is labeled as \( T \). The x-axis has an arrow pointing to the right, and the y-axis has an arrow pointing upwards.

There are four points labeled on the graph:
- Point 1 is at the bottom right.
- Point 2 is slightly above and to the left of Point 1.
- Point 3 is above Point 2, forming a curve.
- Point 4 is directly above Point 3, forming a vertical line.

The curve from Point 1 to Point 2 is smooth and slightly upward. The curve from Point 2 to Point 3 is more pronounced and forms a steeper upward curve. The line from Point 3 to Point 4 is vertical.

The region between Points 1, 2, and 3 is shaded with several lines. The label "isentrop" is written near the vertical line between Points 3 and 4.
