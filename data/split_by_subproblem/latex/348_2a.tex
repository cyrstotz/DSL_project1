    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $s$ in $\frac{kJ}{kg}$ and the y-axis labeled as $T$ in $K$. There are three curves labeled as "isobar" with the following labels: $p_0 = 0,15 \, \text{bar}$, $p_1 = p_5$, and $p_2 = p_5$. The curves are connected by lines labeled as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 to Point 2 labeled as "isotrop"
        \item Point 2 to Point 3 labeled as "isobar"
        \item Point 3 to Point 4 labeled as "isotrop"
        \item Point 4 to Point 5 labeled as "isobar"
        \item Point 5 to Point 6 labeled as "isotrop"
    \end{itemize}
    The points are connected in a cycle, starting and ending at the same point on the $p_0 = 0,15 \, \text{bar}$ curve.
