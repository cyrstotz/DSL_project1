\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled \( T \, [K] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( S \, \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \).
    \item The graph contains a closed loop with six points labeled (1) through (6).
    \item The path from (1) to (2) is a vertical line upwards.
    \item The path from (2) to (3) is a curved line upwards and to the right, labeled "isobare".
    \item The path from (3) to (4) is a vertical line downwards.
    \item The path from (4) to (5) is a curved line downwards and to the right, labeled "isobare".
    \item The path from (5) to (6) is a curved line downwards and to the left, labeled "isotope".
    \item The path from (6) to (1) is a curved line upwards and to the left, labeled "isotope".
