\subsection*{a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a graph with the y-axis labeled as \( T \, [K] \) and the x-axis labeled as \( P \, [\text{bar}] \).
    \item The graph has three regions labeled as "Gas", "Flüssig", and "Fest".
    \item There is a curve separating the "Gas" and "Fest" regions, and another curve separating the "Fest" and "Flüssig" regions.
    \item A point labeled "1" is in the "Gas" region, a point labeled "2" is in the "Fest" region, and a point labeled "3" is in the "Flüssig" region.
    \item Arrows indicate transitions between these points: from "1" to "2" and from "2" to "3".
    \item Below the graph, there are annotations: "isobar", "erst gefrieren", "dann sublimiert", "isobar", and "isotherm".
