\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( s \left[ \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}} \right] \) and the y-axis is labeled \( T \left[ \text{K} \right] \). There are six points labeled 1 through 6. The graph shows several isobars (constant pressure lines) labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), \( p_3 \), and \( p_4 \). The isobars are curved lines that generally slope upwards to the right. The process path is indicated by arrows connecting the points in the following sequence: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6. The path from 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 is vertical, indicating an isentropic process (constant entropy). The path from 2 to 3 and 4 to 5 is horizontal, indicating an isothermal process (constant temperature). The path from 5 to 6 is a downward sloping line, indicating a polytropic process. There are also dashed lines indicating the saturation lines.
