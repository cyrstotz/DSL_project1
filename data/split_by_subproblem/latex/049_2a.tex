    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $\sum (\text{kJ}/\text{kg})$ and the y-axis labeled as $T\text{K}$. The graph consists of a curve that starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls back down. There is a horizontal line intersecting the curve at two points. Additionally, there is a tangent line at the second intersection point, labeled as "Isoline".
