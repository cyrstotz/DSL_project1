\textbf{Verbal Description of the Graph:}
\end{center}

The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $T [K]$ and the y-axis is labeled $p [Pa]$. The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The loop starts at point 1, moves to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 4, before returning to point 1. The path from point 1 to point 2 is a vertical line, the path from point 2 to point 3 is a horizontal line, the path from point 3 to point 4 is a vertical line, and the path from point 4 to point 1 is a horizontal line. The loop is enclosed within a larger curve that starts at the bottom left, rises to the top, and then falls back down to the bottom right.
