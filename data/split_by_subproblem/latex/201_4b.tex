    \item GSI: $\dot{m}_{1234}$
\end{itemize}

\[
0 = \dot{m}_{1234} (h_3 - h_2) + \dot{Q}_{ab}
\]

\[
0 = \dot{m}_{1234} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K \Rightarrow \dot{m}_{1234} = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3}
\]

\[
\Rightarrow h_2 = h_g, \quad s_2 = s_3

\subsection*{Graph Description}

The graph is a pressure-volume (p-V) diagram with the following details:

- The x-axis is labeled as $T [K]$.
- The y-axis is labeled as $p [\text{bar}]$.
- There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- The process from point 1 to point 2 is a horizontal line indicating an isobaric process.
- The process from point 2 to point 3 is a curved line indicating an adiabatic reversible process leading to an isentropic process.
- The process from point 3 to point 4 is another horizontal line indicating an isobaric process.
- The process from point 4 to point 1 is a curved line indicating an isentropic process.
