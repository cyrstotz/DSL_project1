\subsection*{Graphical Description}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $S$ with units $[\frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}]$. The y-axis is labeled $T [K]$. 

Points are marked as follows:
- Point 0 at the origin.
- Point 1 slightly to the right of Point 0.
- Point 2 above Point 1.
- Point 3 to the right of Point 2.
- Point 4 below Point 3.
- Point 5 to the right of Point 4.
- Point 6 below Point 5 and to the right of Point 2.

The lines connecting the points form a closed loop with the following connections:
- Line from Point 0 to Point 2.
- Line from Point 2 to Point 3.
- Line from Point 3 to Point 4.
- Line from Point 4 to Point 5.
- Line from Point 5 to Point 6.
- Line from Point 6 back to Point 0.
