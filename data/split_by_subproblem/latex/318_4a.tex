\section*{4. a}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram.
    \item The y-axis is labeled as $p$ with the unit in brackets [bar].
    \item The x-axis is labeled as $T$ with the unit in brackets [K].
    \item The graph shows a phase diagram with three regions: solid (Fest), liquid (Flüssig), and gaseous (Gasförmig).
    \item The curve separating the liquid and gaseous regions is labeled as "isotherm".
    \item The curve separating the solid and liquid regions is labeled as "isobar".
    \item The point where all three phases meet is labeled as "Tripel".
    \item Points i and ii are marked on the graph, with i in the liquid region and ii in the gaseous region.
\end{itemize}
