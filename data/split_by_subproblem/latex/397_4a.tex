    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy ($T$-$s$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s$ (entropy) and the y-axis is labeled $T$ (temperature). The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The region between points 1 and 2 is labeled "Dampf-Flüssig zweiphasiges Gebiet" (vapor-liquid two-phase region). The region to the left of point 4 is labeled "Flüssig" (liquid), and the region to the right of point 3 is labeled "Gas" (gas). There is an isobar labeled "Isobare $p_3 = 8 \text{ bar}$" extending vertically from point 3. The process from point 4 to point 1 is labeled "adiabat".
