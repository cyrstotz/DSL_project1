\[
T_0 = -30^\circ C = 243.15 \, K

\[
p_0 V_0 = R T_0 \implies V_0 = \frac{R T_0}{p_0}
\]

\[
R = c_p - c_v = c_p - \frac{c_p}{k} = 0.287 \, \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}

\[
\left( V_0 = 3.65908 \, \frac{m^3}{kg} \right)

\[
\frac{T_6}{T_0} = \left( \frac{V_6}{V_0} \right)^{k-1} \implies \frac{T_6}{T_0} = \left( \frac{R T_6}{p_0 V_0} \right)^{k-1}
\]

\[
p_0 V_6 = R T_6 \implies V_6 = \frac{R T_6}{p_0}
\]

\[
T_0 = \left( \frac{R}{p_0 \cdot V_0} \right)^{k-1} T_6^{k-1} = \left( \frac{R}{p_0 \cdot V_0} \right)^{k-1} T_6^{k}

\section*{Description of Figures}

The page contains a series of equations and a diagram. The diagram is located at the top of the page and consists of several arrows and labels. Here is a detailed description of the diagram:

- The diagram shows a process involving temperatures and pressures.
- There are two main states labeled as \( T_6 \) and \( T_5 \).
- \( T_6 \) is connected to \( T_5 \) by an arrow pointing from \( T_5 \) to \( T_6 \).
- Above the arrow, there is a fraction \(\frac{p_6}{p_5}\) raised to the power of \(\frac{k-1}{k}\).
- The labels \( p_6 \) and \( p_5 \) are written next to the respective states.
- The diagram is surrounded by several curved lines and arrows indicating the flow and transformation of the states.

The rest of the page contains the equations written above.
