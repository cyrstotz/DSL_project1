\textbf{Graph Description:} 

The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( P \left[ \frac{\text{bar}}{J} \right] \) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T \left[ K \right] \). The plot starts at the origin and initially rises steeply, forming a peak at about one-third of the way along the horizontal axis. After reaching the peak, the plot gradually declines, forming a smooth, concave curve that extends towards the right end of the horizontal axis.
