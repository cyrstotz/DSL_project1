\text{Graph of } T \text{ vs. } s \text{ with the following details:} \\
\text{The graph has four curves labeled as follows:} \\
\text{1. A curve labeled "isotherm" which is relatively flat.} \\
\text{2. A curve labeled "isobar" which is steeper than the isotherm.} \\
\text{3. A curve labeled "isentrop" which is the steepest.} \\
\text{4. A curve labeled "1-2" which starts at point 1 and ends at point 2.} \\
\text{The points are connected as follows:} \\
\text{Point 1 to Point 2 along the isentrop curve.} \\
\text{Point 2 to Point 3 along the isobar curve.} \\
\text{Point 3 to Point 4 along the isotherm curve.} \\
\text{Point 4 to Point 5 along another isobar curve.} \\
\text{The graph has axes labeled T [K] and s.}
