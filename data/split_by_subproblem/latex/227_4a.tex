\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a phase diagram with temperature \( T \) (in Kelvin) on the x-axis and an unspecified variable on the y-axis. The graph is divided into three regions labeled "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gasförmig" (gaseous). 

- The "Fest" region is on the left side of the graph.
- The "Flüssig" region is on the top right side of the graph.
- The "Gasförmig" region is in the middle and bottom right side of the graph.

There are two curves:
- The first curve, labeled "isotherm," is a horizontal line starting from the "Fest" region and extending into the "Gasförmig" region.
- The second curve, labeled "isobar," starts from the "Flüssig" region and extends horizontally into the "Gasförmig" region.

There are three points labeled 1, 2, and 3:
- Point 1 is on the "isotherm" line in the "Fest" region.
- Point 2 is on the "isobar" line in the "Flüssig" region.
- Point 3 is in the "Gasförmig" region, below the "isobar" line.
