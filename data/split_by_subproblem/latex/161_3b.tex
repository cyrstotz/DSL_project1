    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( p(\text{bar}) \) and the x-axis labeled as \( T(\degree C) \). There are three points labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), and \( 3 \). Point \( 1 \) is in the "fl√ºssig" region, point \( 2 \) is in the "fest" (solid) region, and point \( 3 \) is in the "Dampf" (vapor) region. There are horizontal and vertical lines connecting these points, forming a step-like structure.
