\subsection*{a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as $S \left[\frac{t_1}{kg}\right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[E\right]$.
    \item The graph contains a curve with five marked points labeled from 0 to 5.
    \item The curve starts at point 0, moves vertically up to point 1, then follows a curved path to point 2, continues to point 3, then to point 4, and finally to point 5.
    \item The segment from point 0 to point 1 is labeled as "isentrop".
    \item The segment from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "isobare".
    \item The segment from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "isobare p2=p3".
    \item The segment from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "isobare p3=p2".
    \item The segment from point 4 to point 5 is labeled as "isobare p0=p0".
    \item There is a small inset graph on the right side with axes labeled $T$ and $S$. It shows a simplified version of the main graph with points labeled 0, 1, and 2.
