\subsection*{a)}

The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $S$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T$. The graph contains several curves and points:

- There are three isobaric lines labeled as "isobare 0,5 bar", "isobare 1 bar", and "isobare 0,1 bar".
- There is an isotherm line labeled as "isotherm".
- There is an isentropic line labeled as "isentrop".
- Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The temperature at point 0 is approximately $-30^\circ C$.
- The process from point 0 to 1 is labeled as "adiabate".
- The process from point 1 to 2 is labeled as "isotherm".
- The process from point 2 to 3 is labeled as "isobare".
- The process from point 3 to 4 is labeled as "isobare".
- The process from point 4 to 5 is labeled as "isotherm".
- The process from point 5 to 6 is labeled as "adiabate".
