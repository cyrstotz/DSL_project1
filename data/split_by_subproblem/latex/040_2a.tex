\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as $s \left[ \frac{N}{kgK} \right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[ K \right]$.
    \item The graph contains three curves labeled 1, 2, and 3, each representing different processes.
    \item Points are marked on the curves as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Curve 1: Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
            \item Curve 2: Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
            \item Curve 3: Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
        \end{itemize}
    \item The points are connected with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
    \item The points are labeled with $p_0$, $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_s$.
\end{itemize}
