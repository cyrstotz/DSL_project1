\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a plot of \( T \) [K] on the y-axis versus \( s \) [\(\frac{kJ}{kgK}\)] on the x-axis.
    \item There are several curves labeled as "Isobare (ideales Gas)".
    \item The curves are labeled from 1 to 6, with points marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    \item The points are connected by lines indicating different processes:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 1 to 2: Isotherm
            \item 2 to 3: Isobare
            \item 3 to 4: Isotherm
            \item 4 to 5: Isobare
            \item 5 to 6: Isotherm
        \end{itemize}
    \item Additional annotations include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item "Isotherm" is written next to the horizontal lines.
            \item "Isobare" is written next to the vertical lines.
            \item "adiabate reversible" and "adiabate irreversible" are written next to the slanted lines.
        \end{itemize}
