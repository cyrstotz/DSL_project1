Graph description: The graph is a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram with the x-axis labeled as $s \left[ \frac{u^3}{u \cdot k} \right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[ u \right]$. There are six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by lines indicating different processes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Point 1 to Point 2: Isentropic process
    \item Point 2 to Point 3: Isobaric process
    \item Point 3 to Point 4: Isentropic process
    \item Point 4 to Point 5: Isobaric process
    \item Point 5 to Point 6: Isentropic process
\end{itemize}

The graph also includes curves labeled as "isobare" and "isentrope".
