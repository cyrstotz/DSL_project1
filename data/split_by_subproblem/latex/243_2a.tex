a) \( T(s) \)

\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a plot with an x-axis labeled \( s \) and a y-axis labeled \( T \).
    \item There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    \item The points are connected by lines forming a path: 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6.
    \item There are three isobars labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_3 \), and \( p_5 \) running parallel to the x-axis.
    \item The path from 0 to 1 is vertical, from 1 to 2 is horizontal, from 2 to 3 is vertical, from 3 to 4 is horizontal, from 4 to 5 is vertical, and from 5 to 6 is horizontal.
    \item The points 1, 3, and 5 are on the isobar \( p_3 \), and points 0, 2, 4, and 6 are on the isobars \( p_0 \) and \( p_5 \).
