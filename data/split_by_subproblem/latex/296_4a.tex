\textbf{Verbal Description of the Graph:}
\end{center}

The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($P$-$T$) diagram. The $x$-axis is labeled $T$ (Temperature) and the $y$-axis is labeled $P$ (Pressure). There is a curve that starts from the origin and curves upwards to the right. This curve is labeled "Isotherm". There are two points marked on the curve, labeled 1 and 2. Point 1 is higher up on the curve than point 2. There is a horizontal line extending to the right from point 1, labeled "HÃ¶her". There is a vertical line extending downwards from point 1, labeled "Tripel". The point where the vertical line intersects the curve is labeled 2.
