    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T [^\circ C]$. The graph consists of several curves and lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A curve starting from point $0$ to point $1$ labeled as "isentrop".
        \item A horizontal line from point $1$ to point $2$ labeled as "isobar".
        \item A vertical line from point $2$ to point $3$ labeled as "isotherm".
        \item A curve from point $3$ to point $4$ labeled as "isentrop".
        \item A horizontal line from point $4$ to point $5$ labeled as "isobar".
        \item A vertical line from point $5$ to point $6$ labeled as "isotherm".
        \item A curve from point $6$ back to point $0$ labeled as "isentrop".
    \end{itemize}
    There are also dashed lines indicating the isotherms and isobars, and a shaded area between points $4$ and $5$.
