\textbf{Verbal Description of the Graph:}

The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( P \) [bar] and the x-axis labeled as \( T \) [K]. The graph shows a curve that starts from the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls again. The curve is divided into three regions: "sol." (solid) on the left, "flu." (fluid) in the middle, and "gas" on the right. There are three points marked on the curve: point 1 at the bottom right, point 2 at the bottom left, and point 3 at the peak. A vertical dashed line extends from point 3 upwards. A horizontal arrow points from point 2 to point 1.
