\subsection*{a) T-s Diagramm}

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a T-s diagram with temperature \( T \) on the vertical axis and entropy \( s \) on the horizontal axis. The graph consists of six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by lines forming a closed loop. The lines between points 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 5, 5 and 6, and 6 and 1 are drawn. The lines between points 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4 are curved, while the lines between points 4 and 5, 5 and 6, and 6 and 1 are straight. The region between points 1 and 2 is shaded with diagonal lines.
    \item[Graph 2:] The second graph is a P-v diagram with pressure \( P \) on the vertical axis and specific volume \( v \) on the horizontal axis. The graph consists of six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by lines forming a closed loop. The lines between points 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 5, 5 and 6, and 6 and 1 are drawn. The lines between points 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4 are curved, while the lines between points 4 and 5, 5 and 6, and 6 and 1 are straight. The region between points 1 and 2 is shaded with diagonal lines.
