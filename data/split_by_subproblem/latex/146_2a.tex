\item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \left[ \frac{J}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T [K]$. The graph contains several lines and points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Point 1 is at the bottom left.
    \item Point 2 is above point 1, connected by a vertical line labeled "adiabat".
    \item Point 3 is to the right of point 2, connected by a horizontal line labeled "isobar".
    \item Point 4 is below point 3, connected by a vertical line labeled "adiabat".
    \item Point 5 is to the left of point 4, connected by a horizontal line labeled "isobar".
    \item Point 6 is below point 5, connected by a vertical line labeled "adiabat".
    \item Point 7 is to the right of point 6, connected by a horizontal line labeled "isobar".
    \item Point 8 is below point 7, connected by a vertical line labeled "adiabat".
    \item There are several isothermal lines and isobaric lines drawn parallel to the x-axis and y-axis respectively.
    \item The region between points 1, 2, 3, and 4 is shaded.
    \item The pressures $P_1 = P_3 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}$ and $P_6 = P_0 = 0.15 \, \text{bar}$ are indicated.
\end{itemize}
