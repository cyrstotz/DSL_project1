\[
0 = \sum_i \frac{\dot{Q}_i}{T_s} + \dot{S}_{ent}
\]

\subsection*{Graphical Description:}
There is a rectangular box with a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right. The box is divided into two sections by this diagonal line. The top left section is shaded. There are four arrows:
- One arrow pointing upwards from the top left section labeled $\dot{Q}_{aus}$.
- One arrow pointing to the right from the top right section labeled $T_{KF, aus}$.
- One arrow pointing downwards from the bottom right section labeled $T_{aus}$.
- One arrow pointing to the right from the bottom left section labeled $T_{ein}$.
