    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a phase diagram with pressure \( P \) on the y-axis labeled in \([bar]\) and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis labeled in \((^\circ C)\). The graph shows three regions labeled "Fest" (solid), "Fl端ssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). The "Fest" region is on the left, the "Fl端ssig" region is on the top right, and the "Gas" region is on the bottom right. There is a curve separating the "Fest" and "Gas" regions, and another curve separating the "Fl端ssig" and "Gas" regions. These curves meet at a point labeled "Tripel" (triple point). There are two points marked on the graph: point 1 in the "Fest" region and point 2 in the "Gas" region. There is an arrow pointing from point 1 to point 2, passing through the "Fl端ssig" region, with an intermediate point labeled "X".
