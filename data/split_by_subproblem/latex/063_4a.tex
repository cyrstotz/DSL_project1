    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled $p$ and the horizontal axis is labeled $T$. There are two curves on the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The first curve is a horizontal line labeled "isobar" at the bottom of the graph.
        \item The second curve starts from the bottom left, curves upwards, and then bends to the right. This curve is labeled "isotherm".
    \end{itemize}
    There are two points marked on the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point (i) is on the isobar line.
        \item Point (ii) is on the isotherm curve.
    \end{itemize}
    The intersection of the isobar and isotherm is labeled "Tripel".
