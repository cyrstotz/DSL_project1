    % Detailed verbal description of the graph
    The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( a' \, [T_k] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( S \left[ \frac{L F}{kg \cdot K} \right] \). The plot contains several curves and points:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There is a curve starting from the origin (0,0) and moving upwards and to the right, labeled with points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
        \item Point 1 is located near the origin.
        \item Point 2 is slightly above and to the right of point 1.
        \item Point 3 is further up and to the right, with a label "Enden" pointing to it.
        \item Point 4 is slightly below point 3, with a label "Enden" pointing to it.
        \item Point 5 is below point 4, with a label "Enden" pointing to it.
        \item There is another curve starting from the origin and moving upwards and to the right, labeled with points 6 and 7.
        \item Point 6 is located near the origin.
        \item Point 7 is slightly above and to the right of point 6.
    \end{itemize}
