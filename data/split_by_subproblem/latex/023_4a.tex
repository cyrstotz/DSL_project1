\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \). The graph shows a curve that starts at the bottom left, oscillates up and down several times, and then curves downwards to the right.
    \item[Graph 2:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \). There are two lines: one labeled "Gas, fest" which is a straight line starting from the origin and going upwards to the right, and another line labeled "flüssig" which starts from a point on the first line and goes downwards to the right. There is a point labeled \( T \) on the first line, and a region labeled "flüssig" below the second line.
