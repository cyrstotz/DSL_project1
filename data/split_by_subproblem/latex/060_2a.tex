a)

\textbf{Description of the graph:}

The graph is a pressure-volume (P-V) diagram with the following details:

- The x-axis represents the volume, and the y-axis represents the pressure.
- There are four distinct points labeled as O, A, B, and C.
- The process from O to A is a vertical line indicating an isochoric process (constant volume).
- The process from A to B is a curved line indicating an isobaric process (constant pressure).
- The process from B to C is a vertical line indicating another isochoric process.
- The process from C to O is a horizontal line indicating an isobaric process.
- The points A and C are connected by dashed lines indicating isothermal processes.
- The temperature at point C is greater than the temperature at point B, denoted as \( T_C > T_B \).
