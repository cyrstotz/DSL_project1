\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p(\text{bar}) \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T [K] \). The vertical axis has an arrow pointing upwards, and the horizontal axis has an arrow pointing to the right. There is a curve starting from point 1 on the upper left, moving downwards and to the right, and ending at point 2 on the lower right. This curve is labeled "Isotherme". There are two segments marked on the curve: segment \( i \) from point 1 to an intermediate point, and segment \( ii \) from the intermediate point to point 2. Segment \( i \) is indicated with a solid line, while segment \( ii \) is indicated with a dashed line. Point 1 is labeled at the top left of the curve, and point 2 is labeled at the bottom right of the curve. The intermediate point is labeled with a small circle and the letter \( G \).
