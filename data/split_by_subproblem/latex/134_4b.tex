\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Graph 3:} A graph with axes labeled $P$ (vertical axis) and $T$ (horizontal axis). The graph shows a curve starting from a point labeled 1, rising steeply, then curving downwards and leveling off towards the right.
    \item \textbf{Graph 4:} A graph with axes labeled $P$ (vertical axis) and $T$ (horizontal axis). The graph shows a complex curve with points labeled 1, 2, and 3. The curve starts at point 1, moves to point 2, then to point 3, and finally loops back towards point 2.
