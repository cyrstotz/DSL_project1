\textbf{Graph Description:}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $S \left(\frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}\right)$ and the y-axis is labeled $T (K)$. The graph consists of six points labeled 0 through 5. The points are connected by various lines:

- Point 0 to Point 1: A vertical line labeled "isotherm".
- Point 1 to Point 2: A horizontal line labeled "isotherm".
- Point 2 to Point 3: A diagonal line labeled "45Â°".
- Point 3 to Point 4: A vertical line labeled "isotherm".
- Point 4 to Point 5: A horizontal line labeled "isotherm".
- Point 5 to Point 6: A vertical line labeled "isotherm".

There are also several dashed lines indicating different isotherms and isentropes. The pressures at various points are labeled as $p_0 = p_6$, $p_2 = p_5$, $p_4$, and $p_A$.
