    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled $T \text{ in K}$ and the horizontal axis labeled $S \text{ in } \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}}$. There are several points and lines drawn on the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point $P_0$ is at the bottom right of the graph.
        \item Point $P_3$ is above and to the left of $P_0$.
        \item Point $P_5$ is to the right of $P_3$.
        \item There are arrows indicating transitions between points:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item From $P_0$ to $P_3$ labeled as 1.
            \item From $P_3$ to $P_5$ labeled as 2.
            \item From $P_5$ to $P_0$ labeled as 3.
            \item From $P_0$ to $P_5$ labeled as 4.
            \item From $P_5$ to $P_3$ labeled as 5.
            \item From $P_3$ to $P_0$ labeled as 6.
        \end{itemize}
