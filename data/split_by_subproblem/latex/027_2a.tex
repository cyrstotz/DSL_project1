\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as \( s \left( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}} \right) \) and the y-axis is labeled as \( T \left( \text{K} \right) \). 

There are six points labeled from 0 to 6. The points are connected by various lines indicating different processes:

- Point 0 to 1: A vertical line labeled "isotrop".
- Point 1 to 2: A line with a positive slope labeled "isotrop".
- Point 2 to 3: A line with a positive slope labeled "isotrop".
- Point 3 to 4: A horizontal line labeled "isotrop".
- Point 4 to 5: A line with a positive slope labeled "isotrop".
- Point 5 to 6: A line with a positive slope labeled "isotrop".

There are additional annotations:
- A line labeled "same pressure" connecting points 0 and 6.
- A note indicating that the isobars are a little steep and should probably be more like parallel lines.
