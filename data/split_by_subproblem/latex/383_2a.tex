\subsection*{Graphical Description}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy ($T$-$s$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \, [\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}}]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \, [K]$. 

- There are two isobars drawn: one at 0.5 bar and another at 0.191 bar.
- The isobar at 0.5 bar is drawn as a curve starting from the bottom left and curving upwards to the right.
- The isobar at 0.191 bar is drawn similarly but is positioned to the left of the 0.5 bar isobar.
- Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the graph.
- Point 1 is at the intersection of the 0.191 bar isobar and a vertical line.
- Point 2 is slightly to the right of Point 1 on the same isobar.
- Point 3 is on the 0.5 bar isobar, directly above Point 2.
- Point 4 is to the right of Point 3 on the same isobar.
- Point 5 is on the 0.191 bar isobar, directly below Point 4.
- Point 6 is to the right of Point 5 on the same isobar.
- Arrows indicate the transitions between these points: from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6.
