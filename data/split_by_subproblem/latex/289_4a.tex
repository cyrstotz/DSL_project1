\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn on a grid paper with the y-axis labeled as $p \, [\text{bar}]$ and the x-axis labeled as $T \, [^\circ \text{K}]$.
    \item The graph contains a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    \item The path from point 1 to point 2 and from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "isobar".
    \item The path from point 2 to point 3 and from point 4 to point 1 is not labeled.
