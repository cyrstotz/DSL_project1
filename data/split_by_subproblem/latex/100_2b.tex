\section*{Graph Description}

The graph is a line plot with five points labeled 1 through 5. The x-axis is labeled with a point at the origin (0,0) and extends to the right. The y-axis extends upwards from the origin. The points are connected as follows:

- Point 1 is at the origin.
- Point 2 is directly above point 1 on the y-axis.
- Point 3 is to the right of point 2 and slightly higher, indicating an increase in both x and y values.
- Point 4 is to the right of point 3 but at a lower y value, indicating a decrease in y but an increase in x.
- Point 5 is directly below point 4 on the x-axis, indicating a decrease in y value.

The graph is labeled with "Isotherm" near point 3.
