&= s_{e z} = \Delta s_{0 6} = c_{p,luft} \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_6}{p_0} \right) \\

\begin{description}
\item[Graph:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $s$ and the y-axis labeled as $T$. There are two curves on the graph. The first curve starts at the origin (0,0), rises steeply, and then levels off. The second curve starts at the same point but rises more gradually and then also levels off. The first curve is labeled with a point $1$ at the start, a point $2$ at the peak, and a point $3$ where it levels off. The second curve is not labeled.
