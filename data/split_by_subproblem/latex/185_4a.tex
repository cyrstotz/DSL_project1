\subsection*{a)}

\begin{description}
    \item[Left Graph:] A graph with axes labeled $P$ (vertical axis) and $V$ (horizontal axis). There are two curves, one starting from the top left and curving downwards to the right, and another starting from the bottom left and curving upwards to the right. There is a closed loop in the middle of the graph, with arrows indicating a clockwise direction. Points 1 and 2 are marked on the loop, with an arrow pointing from 1 to 2.
    \item[Right Graph:] A graph with axes labeled $P$ (vertical axis) and $h$ (horizontal axis). There are three curves, one starting from the top left and curving downwards to the right, another starting from the bottom left and curving upwards to the right, and a third curve starting from the middle left and curving upwards to the right. Points 1, 2, and 3 are marked on the graph, with arrows indicating the direction from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3. There is a label "Verdichter" near the top curve.

\[
\eta_{c} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{zu}}{\dot{W}_{r}} = \frac{\left| \dot{Q}_{l} \right|}{\left| \dot{Q}_{l} \right| + \left| \dot{W}_{r} \right|}
