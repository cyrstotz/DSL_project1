Graph description: The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled $T[\degree K]$ and the x-axis labeled $s[\frac{kJ}{kgK}]$. The graph consists of several points connected by lines, representing different states:

- Point 1 is at the origin.
- Point 2 is above and to the right of point 1.
- Point 3 is above and to the right of point 2, with a steeper slope.
- Point 4 is to the right of point 3, with a horizontal line.
- Point 5 is below point 4, with a vertical line.
- Point 6 is below and to the right of point 5, with a steep slope.

The points are connected in the following order: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6. There are labels indicating "isobar" and "isotherm" along the lines connecting the points.
