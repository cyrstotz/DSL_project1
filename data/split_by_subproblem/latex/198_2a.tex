\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as $s$ and the y-axis labeled as $T$.
    \item There are three curves labeled as $P_0$, $P_1$, and $P_2$ from bottom to top.
    \item The curve $P_0$ is labeled as $P_0 = P_6 = 0,1594 \, \text{bar}$.
    \item The curve $P_1$ is labeled as $0.5 \, \text{bar} = P_5$.
    \item The curve $P_2$ is not labeled with a specific value.
    \item There are six points labeled $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$.
    \item The points are connected with lines as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $0$ to $1$ is a vertical line labeled as "isentrop".
            \item $1$ to $2$ is a horizontal line labeled as "isobar".
            \item $2$ to $3$ is a vertical line labeled as "isentrop".
            \item $3$ to $4$ is a horizontal line labeled as "isobar".
            \item $4$ to $5$ is a vertical line labeled as "isentrop".
            \item $5$ to $6$ is a vertical line labeled as "isentrop".
        \end{itemize}
