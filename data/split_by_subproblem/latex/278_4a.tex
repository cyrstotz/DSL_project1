\begin{itemize}
    \item The first graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \, [\text{bar}] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \, [K] \). The graph shows a wavy line that starts at a high value on the vertical axis and oscillates downwards and upwards several times as it moves to the right along the horizontal axis.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The second graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \, [\text{bar}] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \, [K] \). The graph includes the following elements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A curve starting from the origin and rising upwards, labeled "isotherm".
        \item A horizontal arrow pointing to the right from the curve, labeled "fest".
        \item A vertical arrow pointing upwards from the horizontal arrow, labeled "gas".
        \item A horizontal arrow pointing to the right from the vertical arrow, labeled "fl√ºssig".
        \item A vertical arrow pointing downwards from the horizontal arrow, labeled "isobar".
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
