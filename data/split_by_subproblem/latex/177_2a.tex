\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled \( S \left( \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right) \) and the y-axis labeled \( T \left[ K \right] \).
    \item There are three curves labeled \( P_0 \), \( P_2/P_3 \), and \( P_5 \) from left to right.
    \item Six points are marked on the graph and connected with lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 0 is on the leftmost curve \( P_0 \).
        \item Point 1 is slightly above and to the right of Point 0 on the same curve.
        \item Point 2 is on the middle curve \( P_2/P_3 \) and is connected to Point 1.
        \item Point 3 is above Point 2 on the same curve.
        \item Point 4 is on the rightmost curve \( P_5 \) and is connected to Point 3.
        \item Point 5 is below Point 4 on the same curve.
        \item Point 6 is on the leftmost curve \( P_0 \) and is connected to Point 5.
    \end{itemize}
