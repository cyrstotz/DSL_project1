\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as $S \, [\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{K}}]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \, [^\circ \text{C}]$.
    \item The graph contains two isobars labeled as "isobare" and "isobare $p_s = 0.5 \, \text{bar}$".
    \item There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    \item Point 0 is at the origin.
    \item Point 1 is slightly above and to the right of point 0.
    \item Point 2 is further above and to the right of point 1.
    \item Point 3 is above and to the right of point 2, on the upper isobar.
    \item Point 4 is below and to the right of point 3, on the lower isobar.
    \item Point 5 is below and to the left of point 4.
    \item Point 6 is above and to the left of point 5.
    \item Arrows indicate the direction of the process from point 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6.
