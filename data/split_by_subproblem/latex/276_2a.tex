    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T \left[ K \right]$. The graph consists of six points labeled $P_0$, $P_2$, $P_3$, $P_4$, $P_5$, and $P_6$. The process between these points is described as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $P_0$ to $P_2$: Isentropic process (vertical line).
        \item $P_2$ to $P_3$: Isobaric process (horizontal line).
        \item $P_3$ to $P_4$: Isentropic process (vertical line).
        \item $P_4$ to $P_5$: Isobaric process (horizontal line) with $P = 0.5 \, \text{bar}$.
        \item $P_5$ to $P_6$: Isentropic process (vertical line, reversed).
        \item $P_6$ to $P_0$: Isobaric process (horizontal line).
    \end{itemize}
