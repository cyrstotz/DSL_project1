    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($P$-$T$) diagram. The horizontal axis is labeled $T [k]$ and the vertical axis is labeled $P [\text{unles}]$. The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isentrop", the path from point 2 to point 3 is labeled "isobar", and the path from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "isobar". The path from point 4 to point 1 is not labeled. The curve connecting points 1 and 4 is a smooth curve, while the paths between points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are straight lines. The point labeled "ND" is marked on the horizontal axis near the end of the curve.
