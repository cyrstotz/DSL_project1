    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( T \) (Temperature) and the y-axis is labeled \( P \) (Pressure). The graph shows a closed loop with four key points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The process between these points is described as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item From point 1 to point 2: "adiabate und reversibel (isentrop) verdichtung"
        \item From point 2 to point 3: "isobare vollst√§ndige verdampfung"
        \item From point 3 to point 4: "mass dampf"
        \item From point 4 to point 1: "adiabate entspannung"
    \end{itemize}
    Additionally, there are annotations indicating "isobare kondensation" and "ND Gebiet" near the bottom right of the loop.
