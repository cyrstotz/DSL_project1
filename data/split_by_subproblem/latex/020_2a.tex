    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T (K)$. The graph consists of six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by lines indicating different processes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 to Point 2: Isentropic process (vertical line).
        \item Point 2 to Point 3: Isobaric process (horizontal line).
        \item Point 3 to Point 4: Isentropic process (vertical line).
        \item Point 4 to Point 5: Isobaric process (horizontal line).
        \item Point 5 to Point 6: Isentropic process (vertical line).
    \end{itemize}
    The points are marked with circles and labeled accordingly.
