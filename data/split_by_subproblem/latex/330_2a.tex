    \item[Graph Description:] 
    The graph is a plot with an upward-pointing arrow on the vertical axis and a rightward-pointing arrow on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled with $[k] \quad T$ and the horizontal axis is labeled with $[R2 \text{ by } k] \quad S$. There are three blue curves, each representing different pressure levels, labeled as $p_2 = p_3$, $p_5 = p_4$, and $p_{10}$. 

    There are several points marked on the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 0 at the bottom left.
        \item Point 1 slightly above and to the right of point 0.
        \item Point 2 above point 1 on the first blue curve.
        \item Point 3 above point 2 on the second blue curve.
        \item Point 4 to the right of point 3 on the third blue curve.
        \item Point 5 below point 4.
        \item Point 6 below point 5 on the first blue curve.
    \end{itemize}
    
    The points are connected by orange lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A line from point 0 to point 2.
        \item A line from point 2 to point 3.
        \item A line from point 3 to point 4.
        \item A line from point 4 to point 5.
        \item A line from point 5 to point 6.
    \end{itemize}
    
    There is a dashed vertical line from point 3 to point 4.5, and another dashed vertical line from point 4 to point 4.5.
