\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] A graph with pressure \( p \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. There is a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The loop is shaded.
    \item[Graph 2:] A graph with pressure \( p \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. There is a dome-shaped curve with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The left side of the dome is labeled "Fl√ºssig" and the right side is labeled "Gas". The region under the dome is labeled "Nassdampf".
