a) \quad T_{XY}

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] 
    The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as \( s \left[ \frac{1}{kg \cdot K} \right] \) and the y-axis labeled as \( T_{XY} \). There are three curves on the graph, each representing different values of \( P \). The curves are labeled as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The first curve is labeled \( P_0 \).
        \item The second curve is labeled \( P_1 = P_0 \).
        \item The third curve is labeled \( P_2 = P_1 \).
    \end{itemize}
    There are arrows pointing upwards along the curves, indicating the direction of increasing values. The points on the curves are marked with numbers 2, 4, and 6, respectively.
