    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a phase diagram with the y-axis labeled as $p$ and the x-axis labeled as $T$. The graph shows different regions labeled as "solid", "liquid", and "vapor". There is a curve labeled "isotherm" and another curve labeled "isobar". The point where these curves meet is labeled "triple point". There is also a line labeled "isotherm" that intersects the "solid" and "vapor" regions. The graph includes arrows indicating the direction of the phases.
