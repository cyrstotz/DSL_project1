\textbf{Graph Description:}

The graph is a phase diagram with the y-axis labeled as $p$ (pressure) and the x-axis labeled as $T$ (temperature). The graph shows a curve starting from the origin and rising upwards, representing the phase boundary between different states of matter. 

- The curve is labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point) at a specific point where three phases meet.
- To the left of the curve, the region is labeled "fest" (solid).
- To the right of the curve, the region is labeled "fl√ºssig" (liquid).
- Above the curve, the region is labeled "dampf" (vapor).
- There is a line extending from the triple point upwards at an angle labeled $2\alpha$.
- Another line extends horizontally from the triple point to the right, indicating the boundary between liquid and vapor phases.
- A point on the curve is labeled "sieder" (boiling point).
