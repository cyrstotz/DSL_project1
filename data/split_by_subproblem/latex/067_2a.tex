\textbf{Verbal Description of the Graph:}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy ($T$-$s$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \left[ K \right]$. There are six points labeled from 1 to 6. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are connected by a path that forms a loop. Points 5 and 6 are connected vertically to points 2 and 1, respectively. There are three isobaric lines (constant pressure lines) drawn in blue, labeled as $p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar}$ and $p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar}$. The isobaric lines are marked with an asterisk (*).
