\begin{description}
    \item[Left Graph:] A graph with pressure \( P \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. The graph contains multiple curves with varying peaks and troughs, indicating different phases or states.
    \item[Right Graph:] A graph with pressure \( P \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. The graph shows three distinct regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). There is a point labeled "1" and another point labeled "2" with an arrow pointing from 1 to 2. The region between the solid and liquid phases is shaded with diagonal lines, and the point where the three phases meet is labeled as "Sublimationspunkt".
