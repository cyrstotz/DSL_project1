    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $s \, (\frac{kJ}{K})$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \, (K)$. There are several points and lines connecting them:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 is at the bottom left.
        \item Point 2 is directly above point 1.
        \item Point 3 is to the right of point 2, connected by a horizontal line.
        \item Point 4 is below point 3, connected by a vertical line.
        \item Point 5 is to the right of point 4, connected by a horizontal line.
        \item Point 6 is below point 5, connected by a vertical line.
        \item Point 0 is to the left of point 6, connected by a curved line.
    \end{itemize}
    The points are labeled as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $p_{2,3}$ is labeled at the top of the vertical line between points 2 and 3.
        \item $p_{4,5}$ is labeled at the top of the vertical line between points 4 and 5.
        \item $p_0$ is labeled at the top of the curved line connecting points 0 and 6.
    \end{itemize}

\dot{q} = \dot{m} \cdot \left( \frac{h_2}{h_1} \right)

\[
\dot{w} = \dot{m} \cdot \left( \frac{h_2}{h_1} \right)

\[
0 = -\Delta e_{x,str} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) \cdot \dot{q} - \dot{w}_c - e_{x,vel}

\[
e_{x,vel} = -\Delta e_{x,str} + \left( 1 - \frac{T_0}{T} \right) \cdot \dot{q} - \dot{w}_c
