    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as \( p(\text{bar}) \) and the horizontal axis labeled as \( T(\text{K}) \). There are three processes indicated on the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Process von (i) is a vertical line starting from point \( i \) and going upwards to point \( i2 \).
        \item Process von (ii) is a horizontal line starting from point \( i2 \) and going to the right to point \( i1 \). This line is labeled as "isobar".
        \item Process von (iii) is a vertical line starting from point \( i1 \) and going downwards to point \( i \).
    \end{itemize}
