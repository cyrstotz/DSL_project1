\begin{align*}
\overline{T} &= \frac{\int_{T_e}^{T_a} T \, dS}{S_e - S_a} = \frac{T_e (T_e - T_a)}{T_e \ln \left( \frac{T_e}{T_a} \right)} = 252.727 \text{K}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Description of the graph:} There is a sketch of a curve labeled as "T" with an arrow pointing to the right. The curve starts at a higher point and slopes downwards, indicating a decrease in temperature. Below the curve, there is a horizontal line labeled "T_a" and another horizontal line labeled "T_e" at a higher position. The area between these two lines is shaded.

\begin{align*}
T_{ds} &= \Delta t + c \cdot if(T_e - T_a) - \frac{viff}{(h_e - h_a)}
\end{align*}
