    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $T$ and the y-axis is labeled $p$. There are three distinct regions labeled "Fest", "Fl端ssig + Gas", and "Gas". The "Fest" region is on the left, the "Gas" region is on the right, and the "Fl端ssig + Gas" region is in the middle. The graph shows a curve that starts from the "Fest" region, goes through the "Fl端ssig + Gas" region, and ends in the "Gas" region. There are three points labeled $z$, $1$, and $3$ on the graph. Point $z$ is in the "Fest" region, point $1$ is in the "Fl端ssig + Gas" region, and point $3$ is in the "Gas" region. There is a vertical line from point $z$ to point $3$ and a horizontal line from point $1$ to point $3$. The lines are labeled with red color.
