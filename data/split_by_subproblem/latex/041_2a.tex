\textbf{Verbal Description of the Graph:}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $S \, (kJ/K)$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T \, (K)$. 

There are six points labeled 1 through 6, connected by various processes:
- Point 1 to Point 2 is labeled as "isobar".
- Point 2 to Point 3 is labeled as "isobar".
- Point 3 to Point 4 is labeled as "isentrope".
- Point 4 to Point 5 is labeled as "isobar".
- Point 5 to Point 6 is labeled as "isentrope".
- Point 6 to Point 1 is labeled as "isobar".

Additional labels include:
- "p = 0.5 bar" near the top right.
- "p0 = 0.99 bar" near the middle right.
- "isobar" and "isentrope" labels along the respective process lines.
- "M" and "m" near the middle of the graph.
- "Bremskurve" near the top left.
