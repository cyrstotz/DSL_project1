    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as \( V \) and the y-axis is labeled as \( p \). There are three isobars labeled \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) from bottom to top. The graph contains a closed loop with points labeled 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The path starts at point 0, moves vertically up to point 2, then horizontally to point 3, then diagonally down to point 4, vertically down to point 5, and finally horizontally back to point 6, which is at the same horizontal level as point 0.
