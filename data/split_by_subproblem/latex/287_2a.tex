\end{center}

The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( T \left[ K \right] \) and the x-axis labeled as \( s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right] \). The plot consists of six points labeled from 1 to 6. The points are connected by curves and lines as follows:

- Point 1 to Point 2: A horizontal line labeled as "isotrop".
- Point 2 to Point 3: An upward curve labeled as "isobar".
- Point 3 to Point 4: A downward curve.
- Point 4 to Point 5: A vertical line labeled as "isobar (0.5 bar)".
- Point 5 to Point 6: A downward curve labeled as "isobar (0.1 bar)".
