\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] A plot with the y-axis labeled \( p(\text{bar}) \) and the x-axis labeled \( T(\degree C) \). The graph shows a dome-shaped curve labeled "flüssig" on the left side, "Nass-Dampf" in the middle, and "Dampf" on the right side.
    \item[Graph 2:] A plot with the y-axis labeled \( p(\text{bar}) \) and the x-axis labeled \( T(\degree C) \). The graph shows a curve starting from the origin and rising upwards. The curve is labeled "Flüssig" on the lower part and "Dampf" on the upper part. A horizontal line intersects the curve at a point labeled \( T_i \). The intersection point is labeled "Flüssig" on the left and "Dampf" on the right.
