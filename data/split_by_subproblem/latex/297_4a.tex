\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "MD-Kühlst." and the y-axis labeled as "p/p\textsubscript{1}". 
    \item The graph shows a curve that starts from the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls down to a lower level, and then rises again slightly.
    \item Points are marked on the curve as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Point 1 is at the initial rise.
            \item Point 2 is at the peak.
            \item Point 3 is at the first fall.
            \item Point 4 is at the second rise.
        \end{itemize}
    \item A horizontal line is drawn from point 1 to point 3, labeled as "Isobar".
    \item A vertical line is drawn from point 3 to point 4, labeled as "Isotherm".
    \item The area between these lines is shaded.
    \item Additional labels include "MD-Kühlst." and "T\textsubscript{1}".
\end{itemize}
