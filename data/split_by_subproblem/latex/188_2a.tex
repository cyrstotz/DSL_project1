    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s$ (entropy) and the y-axis is labeled $T$ (temperature). The graph contains several isobars (constant pressure lines) labeled $P_0$, $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$, $P_4$, $P_5$, and $P_6$. The isobars are curved lines that start from the left and rise to the right. There is a dome-shaped curve labeled "nassdampf" (wet steam) that intersects the isobars. Points $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ are marked on the graph, with arrows indicating transitions between these points.
