\section*{2. a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( T [K] \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \).
    \item The graph contains a series of points connected by lines, forming a cycle. The points are labeled as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 is at the origin.
        \item Point 2 is above and to the right of Point 1.
        \item Point 3 is above and to the right of Point 2.
        \item Point 4 is to the right of Point 3.
        \item Point 5 is below and to the right of Point 4.
        \item Point 6 is below and to the left of Point 5.
        \item Point 7 is below and to the left of Point 6, and directly below Point 2.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The points are connected in the following order: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7, and 7 back to 1.
\end{itemize}
