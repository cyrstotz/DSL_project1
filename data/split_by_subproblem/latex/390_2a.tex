\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[ ^\circ C \right]$.
    \item The x-axis starts at $-30^\circ C$.
    \item There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    \item The points are connected by curves and lines, forming a cycle.
    \item The points are connected as follows: 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6.
    \item The curve from 0 to 1 is labeled as $p_0 = 0.191 \, bar$.
    \item The curve from 1 to 2 is labeled as $p_2, p_1$.
    \item The curve from 2 to 3 is labeled as $p_3, p_4$.
    \item The curve from 3 to 4 is labeled as $p_4, p_5$.
    \item The curve from 4 to 5 is labeled as $p_5, p_6$.
    \item The curve from 5 to 6 is labeled as $p_6, p_7$.
    \item The points are connected by the following processes:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 0 to 1: adiabatic compression
            \item 1 to 2: adiabatic compression with $\eta_{is} < 1$
            \item 2 to 3: adiabatic compression
            \item 3 to 4: isothermal heat addition
            \item 4 to 5: adiabatic expansion
            \item 5 to 6: adiabatic expansion with $\eta_{is} < 1$
        \end{itemize}
