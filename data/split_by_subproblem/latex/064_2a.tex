\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled $S$ and the y-axis labeled $T$ (in $K$).
    \item There are several points and lines on the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point $1$ is located on the left side of the graph.
        \item Point $2$ is above point $1$.
        \item Point $3$ is to the right of point $2$.
        \item Point $4$ is to the right of point $3$.
        \item Point $5$ is below point $4$ and to the right of point $1$.
        \item Point $6$ is to the right of point $5$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Arrows indicate transitions between points: $1 \rightarrow 2$, $2 \rightarrow 3$, $3 \rightarrow 4$, $4 \rightarrow 5$, and $5 \rightarrow 6$.
    \item There is a label $T_S$ near point $5$.
    \item There is a label $S$ near the bottom right corner of the graph.
\end{itemize}
