The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[ K \right]$. The plot contains a cycle with six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The points are connected by lines, with the following details:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Point 0 is at the origin.
    \item Point 1 is above point 0.
    \item Point 2 is to the right of point 1.
    \item Point 3 is above point 2.
    \item Point 4 is to the right of point 3.
    \item Point 5 is below point 4.
    \item Point 6 is below point 5 and to the right of point 2.
\end{itemize}
There are annotations indicating "isobar" between points 2 and 3, "isotherm" between points 4 and 5, and "isentrop" between points 5 and 6. The curve between points 0 and 1 is labeled "isobar" and the curve between points 1 and 2 is labeled "isentrop".

\[
\eta_s = \left( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 - T_2} \right) < 1
\]
\[
\Rightarrow T_2 > T_1
