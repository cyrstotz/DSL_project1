\subsection*{Graphical Description}

The diagram consists of a large, irregularly shaped closed curve that encompasses several equations and annotations. Inside the curve, there are two main regions separated by a diagonal line. The left region contains the equation:

\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{h_2 - h_3}
\]

and the annotation "ges√§ttigter Dampf". The right region contains the equation:

\[
0 = \dot{m} (h_3 - h_2) - \dot{W}_k
\]

The point where the diagonal line intersects the curve is labeled $h_2$. The top right corner of the diagram contains the equation:

\[
\dot{m} = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{h_2 - h_3}
\]
