        \item[Graph:] 
        The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as $T \cdot t \cdot k$ and the horizontal axis labeled as $S \cdot \sin \frac{45}{\log k}$. The graph consists of a curve that starts at point 0, moves to point 1, then to point 2, and continues to points 3, 4, 5, and finally 6. The curve has a peak at point 3 and a trough at point 4. There are dashed lines indicating the trend of the curve. The region between points 3 and 4 is labeled as "3sobaren".
