    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( p(\text{bar}) \) and the x-axis labeled as \( T(\degree C) \). There are two curves: one labeled "flüssig" (liquid) and the other labeled "Dampf" (vapor). The intersection of these curves is marked with a point labeled \( i \). A vertical line from \( i \) down to the x-axis is labeled \( T_{\text{Krit}} \). Another point on the "Dampf" curve is labeled \( ii \). The region below the curves is labeled "flüssig" and the region above the curves is labeled "Dampf".
