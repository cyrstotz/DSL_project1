    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $s$ and the y-axis labeled as $T$. There are several lines and curves drawn on the graph. The origin is marked as $0$. There are six points labeled from $0$ to $6$ along the curves. The points are connected by lines, and there are annotations such as $p_2 = p_3$, $p_4 < p_3$, $p_4 = p_6$, $0.5$, $4.3$, $1.9K$, and $0.1971$. There are also labels such as $adiab.$, $isobar$, and $isochor$ along the curves. The temperature $T$ is marked as $-30^\circ$ at the bottom left of the graph.
