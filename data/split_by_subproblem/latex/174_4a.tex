    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s$ and the y-axis is labeled $T$. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The process from 1 to 2 is labeled "adiabat" and is a vertical line. The process from 2 to 3 is labeled "isobar" and is a horizontal line. The process from 3 to 4 is labeled "adiabat" and is a vertical line. The process from 4 to 1 is labeled "isobar" and is a horizontal line. There is a point labeled "Triple" near the top left of the graph. The graph also includes a curve labeled "isobar" that intersects the points 1 and 4.
