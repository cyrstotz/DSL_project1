\subsection*{a)}

The graph is a Temperature-Entropy ($T$-$s$) diagram with the following details:

- The x-axis is labeled $s \left[ \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg K}} \right]$.
- The y-axis is labeled $T$ [Â°C].
- There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Point 0 is at the origin.
- Point 1 is higher than point 0, both in terms of $T$ and $s$.
- Point 2 is vertically above point 1, indicating an isentropic process ($s_1 = s_2$).
- Point 3 is to the right of point 2, indicating an isobaric process ($p_3 = p_2$).
- Point 4 is below point 3, indicating a decrease in entropy ($s_3 < s_4$).
- Point 5 is to the right of point 4, indicating an isobaric process ($p_4 = p_5 = 0.5$ bar).
- Point 6 is vertically below point 5, indicating an isentropic process ($s_5 = s_6$).

The graph includes the following annotations:
- "Isobar" between points 1 and 2.
- "Isentrop" between points 2 and 3.
- "Isobar" between points 3 and 4.
- "Isentrop" between points 4 and 5.
- "Isotherm" along the x-axis.
