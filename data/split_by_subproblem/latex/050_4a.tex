\begin{itemize}
    \item The first graph is a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $V$ (Volume) and the y-axis is labeled as $p$ (Pressure). There are two curves: one labeled "compressed" and the other labeled "ST1". The point where the two curves intersect is labeled "x". The region below the "compressed" curve is labeled "ND". There is a vertical line from the x-axis to the point "x" labeled "8 bar".
    \item The second graph is also a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as "Lindampf" and the y-axis is labeled as "compressed". There are two curves: one labeled "compressed" and the other labeled "SH superheated". The region below the "compressed" curve is labeled "ND".
