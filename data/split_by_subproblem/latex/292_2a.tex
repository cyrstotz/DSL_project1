\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}
The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \left[ K \right]$. The graph consists of a cycle with the following points:

- Point 1: At the bottom left, labeled as "isentrop".
- Point 2: Above point 1, labeled as "isobar".
- Point 3: To the right of point 2, labeled as "isobar".
- Point 4: Below point 3, labeled as "isentro".
- Point 5: To the left of point 4, labeled as "isentro".

The cycle follows the path 1 $\rightarrow$ 2 $\rightarrow$ 3 $\rightarrow$ 4 $\rightarrow$ 5 $\rightarrow$ 1. There is also a small inset graph showing a linear relationship between two variables, labeled 0 to 9.
