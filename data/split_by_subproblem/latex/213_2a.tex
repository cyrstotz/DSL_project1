\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram.
    \item The vertical axis is labeled \( T \) with units \([K]\).
    \item The horizontal axis is labeled \( S \) with units \(\left[\frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}\right]\).
    \item There are several curves and points labeled on the graph:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A curve labeled "isotrop" with points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
            \item A curve labeled "adiabat" with points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
            \item A curve labeled "isobaren" with points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
            \item A point labeled "0.5 bar" and another point labeled "P0 = 6.13 bar".
        \end{itemize}
    \item The point \( P_2 = P_3 \) is marked on the horizontal axis.
\end{itemize}
