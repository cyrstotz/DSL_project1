    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot on a grid paper with the x-axis labeled as \( s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \) and the y-axis labeled as \( T [K] \). The graph contains several curves and lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are three main curves labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_3 \), and \( p_4/p_4' \).
        \item Points are marked on the graph and connected by lines, forming a cycle. The points are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
        \item The line connecting points 1 and 2 is vertical.
        \item The line connecting points 2 and 3 is curved upwards.
        \item The line connecting points 3 and 4 is vertical.
        \item The line connecting points 4 and 5 is curved downwards.
        \item The line connecting points 5 and 6 is vertical.
        \item The line connecting points 6 and 1 is horizontal.
    \end{itemize}
