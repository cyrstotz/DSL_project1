    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram. The y-axis is labeled with \( p \) and the x-axis is labeled with \( T \). There are three points labeled 1, 2, and 3. Point 1 is at the intersection of the isentrope and the isobar at 8 bar. Point 2 is on the isentrope curve below point 1. Point 3 is on the isobar line at 8 bar, to the right of point 1. The isentrope curve is concave downwards, and the isobar line is horizontal. The isentrope curve is labeled "isentrope" and the isobar line is labeled "isobar".
