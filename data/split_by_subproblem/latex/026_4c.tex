\section*{Student Solution}

\subsection*{Graph 1}

The first graph is a $P$ vs $T$ diagram. The horizontal axis is labeled $T$ and the vertical axis is labeled $P$. The graph consists of a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The loop is a quadrilateral with the following characteristics:

- Point 1 is at the bottom left.
- Point 2 is at the bottom right.
- Point 3 is at the top right.
- Point 4 is at the top left.

The path follows the sequence 1 $\rightarrow$ 2 $\rightarrow$ 3 $\rightarrow$ 4 $\rightarrow$ 1. There is a horizontal line at the top of the graph labeled $8 \text{ bar}$.

\subsection*{Graph 2}

The second graph is a $P$ vs $T$ diagram with a different scale. The horizontal axis is labeled $T \, [K]$ and the vertical axis is labeled $P \, [\text{bar}]$. The graph consists of a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The loop is a quadrilateral with the following characteristics:

- Point 1 is at the bottom left.
- Point 2 is at the bottom right.
- Point 3 is at the top right.
- Point 4 is at the top left.

The path follows the sequence 1 $\rightarrow$ 2 $\rightarrow$ 3 $\rightarrow$ 4 $\rightarrow$ 1. The graph also includes a curved line that starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak near point 4, and then descends to the bottom right.
