\item[a)] \textbf{Graph Description:} The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled $S \left( \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right)$ and the y-axis labeled $T \left[ K \right]$. There are two curves on the graph. The lower curve is labeled "adiabate Kompressor" and the upper curve is labeled "isobaren". Both curves start from the same point on the x-axis. The upper curve is steeper than the lower curve. There is a vertical arrow between the two curves indicating a process from the lower curve to the upper curve. The upper curve is labeled $p_5$ and the lower curve is labeled $p_0/p_6$.
