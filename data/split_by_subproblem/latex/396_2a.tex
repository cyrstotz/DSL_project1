    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( s \, (\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{K}}) \) and the y-axis is labeled \( T \, (\text{K}) \). There are two isobaric lines: one labeled \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and the other labeled \( 0.9316 \, \text{bar} \). The graph shows two vertical arrows indicating processes at constant entropy. The first arrow starts at point \( O \) and ends at point \( 5 \) on the \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) line. The second arrow starts at point \( O \) and ends at point \( L \) on the \( 0.9316 \, \text{bar} \) line. Both arrows are labeled as "adiabatic".
