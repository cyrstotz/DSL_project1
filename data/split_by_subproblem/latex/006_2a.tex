\textbf{Description of the graph:} The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled $T \, [K]$ and the horizontal axis labeled $s \, \left[\frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}\right]$. The plot consists of a curve that starts at point 1, moves to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 4. There is a dashed line connecting points 2 and 3, labeled $P_{23}$. The curve continues from point 4 to point 5, and then to point 6. The curve is smooth and shows a typical thermodynamic process.
