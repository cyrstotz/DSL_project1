\subsection*{a)}

The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( T \) (Â°C) and the x-axis labeled as \( [U] \left( \frac{kJ}{kg} \right) \). The y-axis ranges from -30 to 67. 

There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. 

- Point 0 is at the bottom left, at approximately (-30, 0).
- Point 1 is slightly above point 0.
- Point 2 is above point 1, with a label "Misch betrop".
- Point 3 is at the top right, above point 2.
- Point 5 is to the right of point 3, with an arrow indicating an isentrope.
- Point 6 is below point 5, with a label \( P = 0.191 \).

The points are connected with lines, and there are arrows indicating the direction of the process between the points.
