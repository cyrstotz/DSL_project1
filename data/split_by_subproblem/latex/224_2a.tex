\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram.
    \item The x-axis is labeled as $V$ with units $[\frac{m^3}{kg}]$.
    \item The y-axis is labeled as $P$ with units $[\frac{W}{kgK}]$.
    \item There are six points labeled 1 through 6.
    \item The process from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "isentrope".
    \item The process from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "isobare".
    \item The process from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "isobare".
    \item The process from point 4 to point 5 is labeled as "isobare".
    \item The process from point 5 to point 6 is labeled as "isobare".
