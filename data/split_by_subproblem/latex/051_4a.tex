\textbf{Graph Description:} The graph is a pressure-volume (p-V) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $T$ (temperature) and the y-axis is labeled as $p$ (pressure). There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The graph shows a closed loop with the following details:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Point 1 to Point 2: A horizontal line labeled "isobar".
    \item Point 2 to Point 3: A curved line moving upwards labeled "Nassdampfgebiet".
    \item Point 3 to Point 4: A horizontal line labeled "isobar".
    \item Point 4 to Point 1: A curved line moving downwards.
\end{itemize}
