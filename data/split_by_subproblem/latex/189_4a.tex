    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The vertical axis represents pressure ($p$) and the horizontal axis represents temperature ($T$). There are three points labeled 1, 2, and 3. Point 1 is at the top right, point 2 is directly below point 1, and point 3 is to the left of point 2. The line from point 1 to point 2 is vertical, indicating a constant temperature process. The line from point 2 to point 3 is horizontal, indicating a constant pressure process. The pressure at point 3 is labeled as $p_{\text{Tripel}}$ and $p_{\text{prop}=5\text{bar}}$.
