The graph shows three phases: "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). The phase boundaries are drawn as curves separating these regions. There are three points labeled 1, 2, and 3, with arrows indicating transitions between these points. The transition from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "i)" and the transition from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "ii)".
