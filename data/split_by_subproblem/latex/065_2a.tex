    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T[K]$. The graph contains three isobaric lines labeled $p_2 = p_3$, $p_4 = p_5$, and $p_0$. There are six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 to Point 2: Vertical line.
        \item Point 2 to Point 3: Horizontal line.
        \item Point 3 to Point 4: Vertical line.
        \item Point 4 to Point 5: Horizontal line.
        \item Point 5 to Point 6: Vertical line.
    \end{itemize}
    The points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are connected by dashed lines indicating isobaric processes.
