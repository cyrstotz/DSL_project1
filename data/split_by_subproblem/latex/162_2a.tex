    \item[Left Graph:] 
    The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as S and the y-axis is labeled as T. There are several curves and lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A black curve starting from the origin and curving upwards to the right.
        \item A blue curve starting from the origin, curving upwards, and then sharply turning downwards.
        \item A straight black line with a negative slope intersecting the blue curve.
        \item A point labeled $P_0$ on the straight black line.
        \item A vertical blue line from the x-axis to the intersection point of the blue curve and the straight black line.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[Right Graph:]
    The graph is also a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as S and the y-axis is labeled as T. There are several curves and lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A straight line with a positive slope.
        \item A blue curve starting from the origin, curving upwards, and then sharply turning downwards.
        \item A point labeled $P_0$ on the straight line.
        \item A vertical blue line from the x-axis to the intersection point of the blue curve and the straight line.

\section*{Problem 2a}

The diagram is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) graph. The x-axis represents entropy (S) and the y-axis represents temperature (T). There are several points labeled on the graph:

- Point 1 is at the bottom left.
- Point 2 is slightly to the right and above point 1.
- Point 3 is further to the right and above point 2.
- Point 4 is to the right of point 3.
- Point 5 is above point 4.
- Point 6 is to the left of point 5.

There are curves connecting these points:

- A curve from point 1 to point 2.
- A curve from point 2 to point 3.
- A curve from point 3 to point 4.
- A curve from point 4 to point 5.
- A curve from point 5 to point 6.

There is a vertical line labeled "C" between points 5 and 6. The region between points 1, 2, and 3 is shaded with diagonal lines. The region between points 3, 4, and 5 is shaded with horizontal lines. The region between points 5 and 6 is shaded with vertical lines.
