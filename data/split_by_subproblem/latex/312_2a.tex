\text{The graph is a plot of temperature } T \text{ (in } K \text{) on the y-axis versus entropy } S \text{ (in } \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \text{) on the x-axis.} \\
\text{The graph starts at point 0 and moves to point 1, then to point 2, 3, 4, 5, and finally to point 6.} \\
\text{There are dashed lines indicating isobars: } P_1 = P_5 = P_4 \text{ and } P_2 = P_3. \\
\text{The points are connected with straight lines, forming a closed loop.} \\
\text{The label } P_0 = P_6 \text{ is written near point 6.} \\
\text{The word "Isobaren" is written near the dashed lines.}
