The graph is a pressure-volume (p-v) diagram with the following details:
- The x-axis is labeled $T [K]$.
- The y-axis is labeled $p [bar]$.
- There are four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- The path from state 1 to state 2 is a horizontal line.
- The path from state 2 to state 3 is a vertical line.
- The path from state 3 to state 4 is a curved line.
- The path from state 4 to state 1 is a horizontal line.
