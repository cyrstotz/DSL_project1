\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($P$-$T$) diagram.
    \item The $y$-axis is labeled $P$ with units in $[\text{bar}]$.
    \item The $x$-axis is labeled $T$ with units in $[\text{K}]$.
    \item The curve starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls back down, forming a closed loop.
    \item There are three points marked on the curve:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Point 1 is at the lower left part of the curve.
            \item Point 2 is at the lower right part of the curve.
            \item Point 3 is at the top of the curve.
        \end{itemize}
    \item There is a horizontal line connecting points 1 and 2, labeled $x$.
    \item There is a vertical line from point 3 to the horizontal line, labeled $y$.
    \item The region inside the loop is labeled "2-Phasen".
\end{itemize}
