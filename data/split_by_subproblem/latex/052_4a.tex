\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Graph I:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The graph is a PV diagram with the y-axis labeled as \( p(\text{bar}) \) and the x-axis labeled as \( V \).
        \item There is a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
        \item The path goes from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 back to 1.
        \item The path from 1 to 2 is horizontal, from 2 to 3 is vertical, from 3 to 4 is horizontal, and from 4 to 1 is vertical.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Graph II:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The graph is a PT diagram with the y-axis labeled as \( p(\text{bar}) \) and the x-axis labeled as \( T(\text{K}) \).
        \item There are two curves, one labeled \( \text{liquid} \) and the other \( \text{vapor} \).
        \item There are two points labeled 1 and 2 on the liquid curve.
        \item There is an arrow pointing from point 1 to point 2.
