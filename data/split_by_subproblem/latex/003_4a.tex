        \item[Graph Description:] 
        The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($P$-$T$) diagram. The vertical axis is labeled $P$ with the unit $[bar]$. The horizontal axis is labeled $T$ with the unit $[U]$. There is a curve that starts from the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls back down to the bottom right, forming a bell shape. This curve is labeled as $NS$. There are four points marked on the graph: point 1 at the left base of the curve, point 2 at the peak, point 3 at the right base of the curve, and point 4 slightly above point 1 on the left side of the curve. The segment connecting points 1 and 2 is labeled "adiabat", the segment connecting points 2 and 3 is labeled "isobar", and the segment connecting points 3 and 4 is labeled "adiabat reversible".

There is a curve that starts from the bottom left, rises to a peak, and then falls back down to the bottom right, forming a bell shape. This curve is labeled as $NS$. There is a point marked at the peak of the curve, labeled as point 2. The segment above point 2 is labeled "isotherm", and the point itself is labeled "Triplepunkt".
