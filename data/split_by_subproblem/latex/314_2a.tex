\text{Graph of } T[K] \text{ vs. } s \\
\text{The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled } s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right] \text{ and the y-axis labeled } T[K]. \\
\text{The graph consists of six points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.} \\
\text{Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2,} \\
\text{point 4 is above point 3, point 5 is to the right of point 4, and point 6 is below point 5.} \\
\text{There is a curve connecting these points in the order 1-2-3-4-5-6.} \\
\text{There is a label "Isobar" between points 3 and 4.}
