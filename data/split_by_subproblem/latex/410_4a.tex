    \item[Graph:] The graph is a Pressure-Temperature ($P$-$T$) diagram. The $y$-axis is labeled $P$ with units in $[\text{bar}]$. The $x$-axis is labeled $T$ with units in $[\degree C]$. The graph shows a curve that starts at point 1 on the $x$-axis, rises to a peak, and then descends to point 2 on the $x$-axis. There is an arrow pointing from point 2 to point 1 along the $x$-axis.
