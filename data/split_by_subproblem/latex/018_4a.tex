\textbf{Graph Description:} The graph is a pressure-volume (P-V) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $v [\text{m}^3/\text{kg}]$ and the y-axis is labeled $p [\text{bar}]$. There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is directly to the right of point 1, point 3 is above point 2, and point 4 is to the left of point 3. The process from 1 to 2 is labeled as "isotherm", from 2 to 3 as "isobar", from 3 to 4 as "isotherm", and from 4 to 1 as "isentrop".
