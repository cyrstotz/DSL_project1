\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a plot of pressure \( p \) in \([ \text{bar} ]\) versus temperature \( T \) in \([ ^\circ \text{C} ]\).
    \item The x-axis is labeled \( T \) \([ ^\circ \text{C} ]\) and the y-axis is labeled \( p \) \([ \text{bar} ]\).
    \item There is a curve that starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls back down, forming a closed loop.
    \item A straight line intersects the curve, labeled as \( T_{\text{tripel}} \).
    \item Points i and ii are marked on the graph, with point i on the curve and point ii on the straight line.
    \item The region to the left of the curve is labeled "Nach N. W. Z. 22-52 kJ/kg".
