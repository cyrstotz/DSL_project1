\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a $p$ vs $T$ diagram.
    \item The y-axis is labeled $p$ and the x-axis is labeled $T$.
    \item There are three regions labeled "Fest", "Flüssig", and "gas".
    \item The curve starts from the origin and curves upwards, separating the "Fest" and "gas" regions.
    \item A horizontal line extends from the curve into the "Flüssig" region, labeled "noch nicht getoren".
    \item A vertical line from the end of the horizontal line intersects the curve again, labeled "Schluss".
    \item The point where the horizontal line starts is labeled "T".
    \item The point where the curve starts is labeled "getoren".
\end{itemize}
