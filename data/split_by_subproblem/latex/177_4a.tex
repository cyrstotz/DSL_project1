\section*{4 (a)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a graph with the vertical axis labeled \( P \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \).
    \item The graph shows a curve that starts at the bottom left, rises to a peak labeled \( T_c \), and then falls back down towards the bottom right.
    \item The point \( T_i \) is marked on the horizontal axis with a value of \( -20^\circ C \).
    \item The graph is a smooth curve, resembling a bell shape.
\end{itemize}

\[
T_i = -20^\circ C
\]

\[
\lambda_{\text{bar}} = 0.004 \, \text{bar}
\]

\[
\lambda_{\text{mm}} = 0.001
\]
