a) \\
\textit{(Here is a detailed verbal description of the graph)}

The graph is drawn on a grid paper. The x-axis is labeled $T \, [K]$ and the y-axis is labeled $\bar{p}$. The graph shows a curve that starts from the origin and curves upwards to the right. 

There are several annotations and arrows on the graph:
- A point on the curve is marked and labeled as $i$.
- From point $i$, a horizontal arrow points to the right and is labeled $T_{tripol}$.
- From point $i$, a vertical arrow points downwards and is labeled $ii$.
- Another point on the curve to the right of $i$ is labeled $ii$.
- From point $ii$, a vertical arrow points downwards.
- The region to the left of the curve is labeled $Fest$.
- The region to the right of the curve is labeled $Fl√ºssig$.
- The region below the curve is labeled $Gas$.
