\begin{itemize}
    \item The first graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \, \text{in bar} \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \, \text{in K} \). The graph shows a curve that starts at the origin, rises to a peak labeled "cut", and then falls back down.
    \item The second graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled \( p \, \text{in bar} \) and the horizontal axis labeled \( T \, \text{in K} \). The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, forming a triangular shape.
