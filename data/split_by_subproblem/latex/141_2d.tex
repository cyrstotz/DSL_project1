\begin{description}
    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the x-axis labeled as $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right]$ and the y-axis labeled as $T \left[ K \right]$. There are three curves labeled as 1, 2, and 3. Curve 1 starts at the origin and rises steeply, then curves to the right. Curve 2 starts slightly above the origin, follows a similar path to curve 1 but is slightly higher. Curve 3 starts even higher and follows a similar path to curves 1 and 2 but is the highest of the three. There are two horizontal lines intersecting the curves. The first horizontal line is labeled $0.16$ and intersects all three curves at different points. The second horizontal line is labeled $0.5 \, \text{kw}$ and intersects the curves at higher points. There is also a label $0.191 \, \text{bar}$ near the top right of the graph.
