\end{center}

The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $S$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T$. The graph consists of five points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 connected by lines. The path from point 1 to point 2 is labeled as "isobar", the path from point 2 to point 3 is labeled as "isobar", the path from point 3 to point 4 is labeled as "isobar", and the path from point 4 to point 5 is labeled as "isobar". The path from point 5 to point 1 is labeled as "isobar". The points are connected as follows:
- Point 1 to Point 2: A rising curve.
- Point 2 to Point 3: A steep rising curve.
- Point 3 to Point 4: A steep falling curve.
- Point 4 to Point 5: A falling curve.
- Point 5 to Point 1: A horizontal line.
