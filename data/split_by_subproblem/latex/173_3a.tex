\begin{itemize}
    \item Graph description: The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (p-T) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $T$ [KJ] and the y-axis is labeled $p$ [Pa]. The graph shows a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is at the bottom right, point 3 is at the top right, and point 4 is at the top left. The loop is a dome-shaped curve with the top part being a smooth curve and the bottom part being a straight horizontal line connecting points 1 and 2. The pressure at point 1 is labeled as $p_1 = 1 \text{ bar}$ and the temperature at point 1 is labeled as $T_1 = -10^\circ C$.
