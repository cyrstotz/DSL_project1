        \textbf{Graph Description:}
        
        The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled \( s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \) and the y-axis is labeled \( T \left[ K \right] \). There are six points labeled 1 through 6. The process from 1 to 2 is a vertical line (isobar), from 2 to 3 is a curved line (adiabatic), from 3 to 4 is another vertical line (isobar), from 4 to 5 is another curved line (adiabatic), and from 5 to 6 is another vertical line (isobar). There is a small cycle labeled "C" with a note "wie es wirklich verl√§uft" and an isotherm line.
