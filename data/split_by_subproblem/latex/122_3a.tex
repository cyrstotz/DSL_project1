\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a Pressure-Temperature (P-T) diagram.
    \item The x-axis is labeled as $T$ (Temperature).
    \item The y-axis is labeled as $p$ (Pressure).
    \item There are four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 forming a cycle.
    \item Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is directly above point 1, point 3 is to the right of point 2, and point 4 is directly below point 3.
    \item The region between points 1 and 2 is labeled as $Q = 0$.
    \item The region between points 3 and 4 is labeled as $Q = 0$.
    \item The region between points 2 and 3 is labeled as "Nassdampfgebiet".
    \item The region between points 1 and 4 is labeled as $p = \text{const}$.
