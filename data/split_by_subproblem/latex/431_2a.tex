    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \left( \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right)$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \left[ K \right]$. There are three isobars labeled $p_0 = p_6$, $p_4 = p_5$, and $p_2 = p_3$. The graph shows a cycle with points labeled 1 through 6. The cycle starts at point 1, moves to point 2, then to point 3, point 4, point 5, and finally to point 6, which connects back to point 1.
