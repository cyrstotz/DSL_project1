    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a plot with the vertical axis labeled as $T$ and the horizontal axis labeled as $s$. The curve starts at the origin (point 0), rises to a peak at point 3, and then falls back down. There are several points marked on the curve: point 1 is on the rising part of the curve, point 2 is at the peak, point 3 is slightly to the right of the peak, point 4 is on the falling part of the curve, and point 6 is at the end of the curve. There are also isobaric lines labeled $P_0 = P_6$, $P_1$, and $P_3$.
