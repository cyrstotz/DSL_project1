\begin{itemize}
    \item The first graph is a pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $T [°C]$ and the y-axis is labeled $p [\text{bar}]$. There is a point labeled "Trippel" and a shaded region indicating different phases.
    \item The second graph is another $p$-$T$ diagram with more detailed annotations. The x-axis is labeled $T [°C]$ and the y-axis is labeled $p [\text{bar}]$. The graph shows regions labeled "Gas", "Fest", and "isobar". There is a point labeled "Trippel" and lines indicating "isotherm" and "isotherm 2".
    \item The third graph is a $p$-$T$ diagram with the x-axis labeled $T [°C]$ and the y-axis labeled $p [\text{bar}]$. It shows a point labeled "Trippel" and lines indicating "10K über sublimationspunkt" and "10K über sublimationspunkt". There is also a region labeled "Sieder unter Trippelpunkt".
