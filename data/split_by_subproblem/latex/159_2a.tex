\textbf{Graph Description:}
\end{center}

The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as \( S \) and the y-axis is labeled as \( T \). The graph consists of six points labeled from 1 to 6, connected by lines to form a closed loop. The points are connected in the following order: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6, and 6 back to 1. 

There are several dashed lines running horizontally across the graph, indicating constant pressure lines. These lines are labeled as \( P_0 \), \( P_3 \), \( P_4 \), \( P_5 \), \( P_1 \), and \( P_2 \) from bottom to top. The point 3 is labeled with the coordinates "22-934-558".
