\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Graph 1:} A graph with pressure \( p \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. The graph shows three regions labeled "fest", "fl端ssig", and "gas". There are two curves: one starting from the origin and curving upwards to the right, labeled "1", and another curve starting from the same point but curving upwards to the left, labeled "2". The region between these curves is labeled "fl端ssig".
    \item \textbf{Graph 2:} A graph with pressure \( p \) on the y-axis and temperature \( T \) on the x-axis. The graph shows three regions labeled "fest", "fl端ssig", and "gas". There is a point labeled "TP" and two curves: one starting from the origin and curving upwards to the right, labeled "1", and another curve starting from the same point but curving upwards to the left, labeled "2". The region between these curves is labeled "fl端ssig".
