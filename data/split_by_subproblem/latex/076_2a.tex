\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram.
    \item The x-axis is labeled \( s \left( \frac{J}{kg \cdot K} \right) \).
    \item The y-axis is labeled \( T(K) \).
    \item There are six points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    \item Point 1 is at the bottom left, labeled as \( \rho_1 = \rho_4 = \rho_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).
    \item Point 2 is above point 1, connected by a vertical line labeled "adiabat".
    \item Point 3 is to the right of point 2, connected by a horizontal line labeled "isobar".
    \item Point 4 is above point 3, connected by a vertical line labeled "isotherm".
    \item Point 5 is to the right of point 4, connected by a horizontal line labeled "isobar".
    \item Point 6 is below point 5, connected by a vertical line labeled "adiabat".
    \item The line connecting points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 forms a closed loop.
    \item The line connecting points 1 and 6 is labeled \( \rho_0 = \rho_6 = 0.193 \, \text{bar} \).
