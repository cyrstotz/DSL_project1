    \item[Graph Description:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \, [\frac{kJ}{kgK}]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \, [K]$. The graph consists of six points labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by various curves and lines, indicating different thermodynamic processes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 to Point 2: Isentropic process (vertical line).
        \item Point 2 to Point 3: Isobaric process (curved line).
        \item Point 3 to Point 4: Isobaric process (curved line).
        \item Point 4 to Point 5: Isentropic process (vertical line).
        \item Point 5 to Point 6: Isobaric process (curved line).
        \item Point 6 to Point 1: Isentropic process (vertical line).
    \end{itemize}
    The graph also includes annotations indicating the nature of the processes (isobaric or isentropic) and a note that $P_3 = P_0 \rightarrow$ isobaric.
