    \item[Graph:] The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled as $S$ and the y-axis is labeled as $T$. There is a curve that starts at the origin, rises to a peak, and then falls back down. The curve is labeled as "isobare Wärmezufuhr". There are several annotations around the graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To the right of the peak, there is a label "adiabatisch reversibel".
        \item Below the peak, there is a label "adiabatisch irreversibel".
        \item To the left of the peak, there is a label "adiabatisch reversibel".
        \item There is a point labeled "1" on the left side of the curve and a point labeled "2" on the right side of the curve.
        \item There is a label "adiabatische Verdichtung mit $\Pi$ < 1" near the bottom right of the graph.
        \item There is a label "adiabatisch reversibel Schubdüse" near the top right of the graph.
        \item There is a label "adiabatisch irreversibel Turbine" near the bottom right of the graph.
    \end{itemize}
