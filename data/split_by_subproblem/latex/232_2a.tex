\textbf{Graph Description:} The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $S \left[\frac{kJ}{kgK}\right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T[K]$. There are several curves on the graph, each representing different processes. The curves are labeled as follows:

- Curve 1-2: adiabatic process labeled as "isentrop"
- Curve 2-3: isobaric process labeled as "isobar"

There are six points marked on the graph, labeled 1 through 6. The points are connected by the curves mentioned above. The graph also includes the following annotations:

- $p_1 = p_3$
- $p_2 = p_5$
- $p_0 = p_6$
- $p_4 = p_5$
- $p_0, T_0, h_0 = p_0 = p_6$
