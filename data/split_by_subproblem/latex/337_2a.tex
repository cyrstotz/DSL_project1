    \item[Graph 1:] A graph with the y-axis labeled as $T$ [K] and the x-axis labeled as $S$ [K/kgK]. The graph contains several curves and points:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A curve labeled "isobar" starting from point 1 and ending at point 2.
        \item A curve labeled "isotherm" starting from point 2 and ending at point 3.
        \item A curve labeled "isobar" starting from point 3 and ending at point 4.
        \item A curve labeled "isotherm" starting from point 4 and ending at point 5.
        \item A curve labeled "isobar" starting from point 5 and ending at point 6.
        \item A curve labeled "isotherm" starting from point 6 and ending at point 1.
        \item Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the graph.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[Graph 2:] A graph with the y-axis labeled as $T$ [K] and the x-axis labeled as $S$ [K/kgK]. The graph contains several curves and points:
