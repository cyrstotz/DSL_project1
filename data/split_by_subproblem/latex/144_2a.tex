\textbf{Graph Description:}

The graph is a plot with the y-axis labeled as \( T [K] \) and the x-axis labeled as \( S \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \). The graph contains a curve that starts at point 0, moves to point 1, then to point 2, and continues to points 3, 4, 5, and finally 6. There are dashed lines indicating the transitions between points 2 and 3, and between points 5 and 6, with a label of "0.5 bar" near the dashed line between points 5 and 6. Additionally, there is a label "P2 = P3" near the dashed line between points 2 and 3.
