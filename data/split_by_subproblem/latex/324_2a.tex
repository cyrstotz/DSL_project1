\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a graph with the y-axis labeled as \( T [K] \) and the x-axis labeled as \( s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \). 
    \item The graph contains three blue curves, each representing different isobars.
    \item There are six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 connected by black lines.
    \item The points are connected in the following order: 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5.
    \item The point 0 is at the bottom left, point 1 is slightly above and to the right of point 0, point 2 is further to the right and slightly above point 1, point 3 is above point 2, point 4 is to the right of point 3, and point 5 is below point 4.
    \item The points 0, 1, and 2 lie on the first isobar, points 3 and 4 lie on the second isobar, and point 5 lies on the third isobar.
    \item There is an arrow pointing upwards from point 0 labeled "reversible adiabate".
