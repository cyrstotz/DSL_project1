\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph is a Temperature (T) vs. Entropy (S) diagram.
    \item The y-axis is labeled \( T \, [K] \).
    \item The x-axis is labeled \( S \, \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \right] \).
    \item There are six points labeled 1 through 6.
    \item The process from 1 to 2 is labeled as "adiabat".
    \item The process from 2 to 3 is labeled as "adiabat, reversible".
    \item The process from 3 to 4 is labeled as "adiabat".
    \item The process from 4 to 5 is labeled as "adiabat, reversible".
    \item The process from 5 to 6 is labeled as "adiabat".
    \item The process from 6 to 1 is labeled as "adiabat, reversible".
    \item The pressure at point 4 is labeled as \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).
    \item The pressure at point 6 is labeled as \( 0.1 \, \text{bar} \).
