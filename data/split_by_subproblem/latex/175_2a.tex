    \item[Graph:] The graph is a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. The x-axis is labeled $s \left[ \frac{kJ}{kgK} \right]$ and the y-axis is labeled $T \left[ K \right]$. The graph shows a cycle with the following points:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Point 1 to Point 2: Isentrop
        \item Point 2 to Point 3: Isobar
        \item Point 3 to Point 4: Isentrop
        \item Point 4 to Point 5: Isobar
        \item Point 5 to Point 6: Isentrop
    \end{itemize}
    The cycle is drawn with arrows indicating the direction of the process.
