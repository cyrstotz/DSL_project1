\subsection*{Graph Description}

The graph is a pressure-temperature ($P$-$T$) phase diagram. The vertical axis is labeled $P$ [mbar] and the horizontal axis is labeled $T$ [째C]. 

- The graph shows three distinct regions labeled "fest" (solid), "fl체ssig" (liquid), and "gas" (gas).
- The "fest" region is at the top left, the "fl체ssig" region is at the top right, and the "gas" region is at the bottom.
- There is a curve separating the "fest" and "gas" regions, which starts from the top left and curves downwards to the right.
- The point where the "fest", "fl체ssig", and "gas" regions meet is labeled "Tripel" (triple point) at $0^\circ C$.
- A horizontal dashed line at approximately 5 mbar extends from the "Tripel" point to the right, indicating the sublimation pressure.
- The temperature at the triple point is marked as $T_{Tripel} = 0^\circ C$.
- The graph also shows a horizontal line at $T_i @ 5 \text{mbar}$, indicating the initial temperature at 5 mbar.
- Another horizontal line is drawn at $T_i = 9^\circ C$.
