\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 1:] A graph with pressure $P$ on the y-axis and volume $V$ on the x-axis. The graph contains several curves, one of which is labeled "nicht beachtet". The curves show different behaviors, with some increasing and then decreasing, and others just decreasing.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[Graph 2:] Another graph with pressure $P$ on the y-axis and volume $V$ on the x-axis. This graph has a closed loop with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The region inside the loop is labeled "flüssig" (liquid), and the area outside the loop is labeled "gasförmig" (gaseous). The line separating the two regions is labeled "Schmelzkurve" (melting curve).
