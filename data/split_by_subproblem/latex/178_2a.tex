\[
\begin{array}{c}
\text{Graph of } T \text{ vs. } S \\
\text{Vertical axis: } T \, [\text{kJ}] \\
\text{Horizontal axis: } S \, [\text{kJ/kg}] \\
\end{array}
\]

The graph is a closed loop with the following points and segments:
- Point 1 at the origin (0,0).
- Point 2 is above point 1, connected by a vertical line.
- Point 3 is to the right of point 2, connected by a line labeled "isobare".
- Point 4 is below point 3, connected by a vertical line.
- Point 5 is to the left of point 4, connected by a line labeled "isokare".
- Point 6 is below point 5, connected by a vertical line labeled "isobare".
- Point 6 connects back to point 1, completing the loop.

The points are labeled as follows:
- Point 1: 1
- Point 2: 2
- Point 3: 3
- Point 4: 4
- Point 5: 5
- Point 6: 6
