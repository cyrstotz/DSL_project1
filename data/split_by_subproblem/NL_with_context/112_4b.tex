A second p-T diagram is drawn with labeled phase regions. The diagram includes:  
- A curve separating "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous) regions.  
- Points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected by lines forming a cycle.  
- A region labeled "sublim." (sublimation).  

An equation is written:  
"Bilanz Verdichter:  
Q = m dot R134a (h2 minus h3) minus W dot k  
h2 = hg  
h3 = hf plus v times (p minus p sat)  
8 bar"
