Delta ex_str equals h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0) plus one-half w_0 squared minus one-half w_6 squared.  

This equals (T_6 minus T_0) multiplied by c_p^ig minus T_0 multiplied by c_p^ig multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p_6 divided by p_0) plus one-half w_0 squared plus one-half w_6 squared.  

R equals c_p^ig minus c_v^ig.  

This equals (c_p^ig minus c_p^ig divided by n), which equals (c_p^ig multiplied by (1 minus 1 divided by n)).  

c_p^ig equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

R equals 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Delta ex_str equals (340 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin) multiplied by 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin multiplied by 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by the natural logarithm of (340 Kelvin divided by 243.15 Kelvin) minus 0.257 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by the natural logarithm of (1) plus one-half multiplied by (200 meters per second squared) plus one-half multiplied by (500 meters per second squared).
