Delta exergy stream equals (h zero minus h six minus T zero multiplied by (s zero minus s six) plus w zero squared minus w six squared divided by two).  

Delta exergy stream equals (c p multiplied by (T zero minus T six) minus T zero multiplied by (natural logarithm of (T zero divided by T six)) minus R multiplied by (natural logarithm of (p zero divided by p six)) plus w zero squared minus w six squared divided by two).  

Delta exergy stream equals negative 110.050 kilojoules per kilogram.  

w six equals 220 meters per second.  

w zero equals 200 meters per second.  

T six equals 293.15 Kelvin.
