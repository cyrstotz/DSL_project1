Isobaric process:  
1-2: Isobaric, T increases  
2-3: Pressure increases, isentropic  
3-4: Isobaric  
4-1: Pressure decreases, enthalpy decreases, isothermal  

Diagrams:  
- The first diagram shows a pressure-volume (p-V) curve with labeled points 1, 2, 3, and 4. The curve transitions through isobaric, isentropic, and isothermal processes.  
- The second diagram shows a pressure-temperature (p-T) curve with labeled points 1, 2, 3, and 4. The phases are marked as "gas" (x = 1) and "fluid" (x = 0). The curve transitions through isobaric and isothermal processes, with annotations for "ND" and "grade (fluid)."
