Delta ex_str equals h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus w_6 squared divided by two minus w_0 squared divided by two.  

h_6 minus h_0 equals c_p times (T_0 minus T_6) equals 85.439 kilojoules per kilogram.  

s_6 minus s_0 equals c_p times the natural logarithm of T_0 divided by T_6 minus R times the natural logarithm of p_6 divided by p_0 equals negative 0.3013 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

w_6 squared divided by two minus w_0 squared divided by two equals negative 108.649 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta ex_str equals 96.187 kilojoules per kilogram (underlined).
