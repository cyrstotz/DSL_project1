A diagram is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The diagram shows six numbered points (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) connected by lines, with three isobaric curves indicated by blue lines. The points are labeled as follows:  
- \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
An asterisk (*) is noted as "isobar".
