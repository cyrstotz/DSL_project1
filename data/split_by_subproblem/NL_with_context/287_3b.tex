Temperature at state 2 (T_g2):  
T_g2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.  

Since the ice-water mixture (EW) remains in the two-phase region, the temperature stays constant. As the entire system is in equilibrium, T_g2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.  

Pressure at state 2 (p_g2):  
p_g1 equals p_g2 equals 1.4 bar.  

Since the EW always has the same mass and is incompressible, and the weight of the piston remains constant, the pressure also remains constant.
