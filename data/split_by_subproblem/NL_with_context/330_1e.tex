Given:  

Delta S equals Delta m12 multiplied by S2.  

Delta S equals m2 multiplied by S2 minus m1 multiplied by S1 plus Q12 divided by T2 plus S_env.  

Delta S equals Delta m12 multiplied by S2 plus Q12 divided by T2 plus S_env.  

S2 equals S_f at 70 degrees Celsius (from Table A-2) equals 0.9549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.
