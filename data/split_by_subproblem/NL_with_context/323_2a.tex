Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled "T-S" (temperature-entropy) and shows a qualitative process.  
   - The diagram includes points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the process.  
   - The process includes segments labeled "isentrop" (isentropic) and "isobar" (isobaric).  
   - The curve transitions between these labeled regions.  
   - The axis labels are "T" (temperature) and "S" (entropy).  

2. The second diagram is also labeled "T-S" and shows a similar process.  
   - Points 1 through 6 are marked.  
   - The process includes segments labeled "isentrop" and "isobar."  
   - The axis labels are "T" (temperature) and "S" (entropy).
