A graph is drawn with the title "T-s Diagram." The y-axis is labeled as "T(K)" and the x-axis is labeled as "S(kJ/kgÂ·K)." The graph shows a series of points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 connected by curves. The process transitions are marked as "isentrop," "isobar," and "adiabat." The points are connected in a sequence representing the jet engine process.
