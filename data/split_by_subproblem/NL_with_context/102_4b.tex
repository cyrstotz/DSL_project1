Energy balance equation:  
alpha equals m dot times (h2 minus h3) divided by W dot K.  

A table is drawn with the following columns:  
- p  
- T  
- h  
- s  
- x  

The rows contain the following data:  
1. p = blank, T = blank, h = blank, s = blank, x = blank.  
2. p = 5 bar, T = 31.33 degrees Celsius, h = blank, s = blank, x = blank.  
3. p = 8 bar, T = 37.83 degrees Celsius, h = blank, s = blank, x = blank.  

Additional notes:  
- For state 2, "saturated vapor x = 1" is written.  
- For state 4, "fully condensed" is written.
