A diagram is drawn with axes labeled:  
- \( p \, [\text{bar}] \) on the x-axis.  
- \( T \, [\text{K}] \) on the y-axis.  

The diagram shows phase regions labeled:  
- "gas" at the top.  
- "liquid" in the middle.  
- "solid" at the bottom.  

The triple point is marked, and sublimation, evaporation, and condensation lines are drawn.
