The diagram is a T-s graph with labeled isobars and process points.  
- The vertical axis is labeled as T (temperature) in degrees Celsius.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as s (entropy) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K).  
- The process points are labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The isobars are marked in red:  
  - \( P_2 = P_3 \)  
  - \( P_1 = P_a = P_5 \)  
  - \( P_6 = P_0 \)  
- Arrows indicate the direction of the processes between the points.  
- The mantle flow (\( m_M \)) and core flow (\( m_K \)) are labeled along the paths.
