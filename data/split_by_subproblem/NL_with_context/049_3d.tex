Since the pressure is exactly equal to \( p_{amb} + F_A \), which equals 135565.58 Pa or approximately 1.4 bar, we can calculate the internal energy.  

\( x \) corresponds to state 1: \( x = 0.6 \).  

\( U_{m} = 0.6 \cdot u_{ice}(T) + 0.4 \cdot u_{liquid}(p, T) \approx 20.00528 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

\( U_{total} = m_{EW} \cdot U_{m} = 20.00528 \, \text{kJ} \).  

\( \Delta U = 1472.88 \, \text{J} \).  

\( U_2 = U_1 + \Delta U = 21.781.555 \).  

\( U_2 = \frac{U_2}{m} = 217.815 \).  

Now we can delete the system with...  

(Crossed-out section follows, no transcription provided for crossed-out content.)  

\( x_2 = 0.1 \).
