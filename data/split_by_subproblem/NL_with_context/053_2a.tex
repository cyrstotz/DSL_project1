A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states. The diagram includes the following:  
- State 1 at \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) and \( T_0 = -30^\circ \text{C} \).  
- State 2 and State 3 labeled as \( p_2 \).  
- State 4 labeled as \( p_3 = 8 \, \text{bar} \).  
- State 5 at \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  
- State 6 at \( p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  

The diagram shows reversible and isobaric processes connecting the states. The axes are labeled as \( T [\text{K}] \) for temperature and \( S [\text{u/q}] \) for entropy.
