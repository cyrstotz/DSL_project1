The equation is written:  
w_6 = square root of (2 times (h_0 minus h_6) plus w_5 squared)  

Another equation is written:  
w_6 = square root of (2 times cp_L times (T_0 minus T_6) plus w_5 squared)  

w_6 = 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin

w subscript 6 equals square root of two times c subscript p times แน times g times (T subscript 0 minus T subscript 6) plus w subscript 0 squared.
