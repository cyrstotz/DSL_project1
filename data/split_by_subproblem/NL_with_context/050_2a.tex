A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and processes.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled 's' (entropy).  
- The vertical axis is labeled 'T' (temperature).  
- Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Point 0 is labeled with '-30Â°C Umgebung' (surroundings).  
- Point 2 is labeled 'p2 = p3'.  
- Point 3 is labeled 'p4 < p3'.  
- Point 4 is labeled 'p4 = p5'.  
- Point 5 is labeled '0.5 bar, 431.9 K'.  
- Point 6 is labeled '0.191 bar'.  
- Processes are annotated: 'adiab rev' (adiabatic reversible), 'isobar', and 'adiab irr' (adiabatic irreversible).
