Two times (h zero minus h six) minus w six squared equals minus w zero squared.  
Minus two times 208 equals minus 220 squared divided by two equals minus w zero squared.  
w six equals 481.6 meters per second.

A table is presented with columns labeled 'P', 'U', 'T'.  
- Row 0: P = 0.191 bar, T = -30Â°C.  
- Row 5: P = 0.5 bar, T = 431.9 K, w5 = 220 m/s.  
- Row 6: P = p0.  

Below the table:  
The stationary energy balance for the nozzle is written as:  
sigma = m dot times [(h5 minus h6) plus (w5 squared minus w6 squared) divided by 2].  

Reusable adiabatic nozzle equation:  
T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

n equals 1.4.  

h5 minus h6 equals cp times (T5 minus T6).  
= 1.006 times (431.5 minus 320).  
= 104 kJ/kg.  

T6 equals T5 times (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  
T6 equals 320 K.
