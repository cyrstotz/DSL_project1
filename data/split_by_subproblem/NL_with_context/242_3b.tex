P_g2 should remain constant because p_0 does not change and the mass from above remains constant.  
P_g2 equals 1.44 bar.  

T_g2: The water does not reach a significantly higher energy level than the gas for a fixed temperature difference, i.e., the gas adjusts itself significantly to the water surroundings.  
=> T_g2 equals x equals 0 equals 0.0003 epsilon.
