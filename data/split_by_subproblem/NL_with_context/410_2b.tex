The equation \( S_5 = S_6 \) is written.  

The entropy change \( \Delta S \) is expressed as:  
\( 0 = \Delta S = \int_{T_5}^{T_c} \frac{c_p^{is}(T)}{T} \, dT - R \ln \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right) \).  

Simplified to:  
\( 0 = c_p^{is} \left( \ln \left( \frac{T_c}{T_5} \right) \right) - R \ln \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right) \).  

Further derivation:  
\( \frac{T_c}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \).  
Thus:  
\( T_c = T_5 \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \).  

A value is calculated:  
\( T_c = 328.07 \, \text{K} \).  

An energy balance equation is written:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right) - \dot{Q} - \Sigma \dot{W}_{in} \).  

Simplified to:  
\( 0 = h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} - \dot{W} \).  

Another equation is derived:  
\( w_6 = \sqrt{2 \left( h_5 - h_6 - \dot{W} + \frac{w_5^2}{2} \right)} \).  

Some parts of the equations are crossed out.

w equals R multiplied by (T6 minus T5) divided by (1 minus n).  
w equals 259.56 kilojoules.  

wc equals the square root of 2 multiplied by (h6 minus h5 minus w divided by w5 squared divided by 2).  
w5 equals 220 meters per second (ideal gas).  

(h5 minus h6) equals Cp multiplied by (T6 minus T5).  

wc equals the square root of 2 multiplied by (Cp multiplied by (T6 minus T5) minus R multiplied by (T6 minus T5) divided by (1 minus n)) divided by w5 squared divided by 2.  
wc equals 551.5 meters per second.
