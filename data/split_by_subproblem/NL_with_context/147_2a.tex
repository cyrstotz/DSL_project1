A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as T [K] (vertical axis) and s [kJ/kgÂ·K] (horizontal axis). The diagram represents a T-s process with labeled points:  
- Point 0  
- Point 2  
- Point 3  
- Point 4  
- Point 5  
- Point 6  

The process includes isobaric lines and arrows indicating the direction of the process. Specific annotations are written:  
- "p5 = 0.5 bar"  
- "p6 = p0 - 0.191 bar"  
- "isobar"
