A diagram is drawn showing a rectangular box labeled "Wand" (Wall). Above the box, an arrow points upward with the label "65 kW." Below the box, another arrow points downward with the label "65 kW." The temperatures \( T_{KF} \) and \( T_R = 373.15 \, \text{K} \) are indicated.  

An equation is written:  
\( 0 + \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{373.15 \, \text{K}} - \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{293 \, \text{K}} + \dot{S}_{erz} = 0 \)  

Below this, the entropy balance around the wall is described:  
\( \dot{S}_{erz} = 0.04675 \, \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}} = 416.15 \, \frac{\text{W}}{\text{K}} \)
