The equation for work is written as:  
Negative W subscript K equals m dot multiplied by the difference between h subscript 2 and h subscript 3.  

h subscript 2 equals h subscript g at 2 kilopascal equals 249.3 kilojoules per kilogram.  

h subscript 3 equals h subscript g at 8 bar equals approximately 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram.  

m dot equals negative W subscript K divided by the difference between 249.3 kilojoules per kilogram and 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram equals 1.223732 kilograms per second.
