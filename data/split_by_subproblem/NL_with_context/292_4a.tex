A graph is drawn with pressure (p in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points and lines:  
- Point 1 labeled "isobar"  
- Point 2 labeled "isobar"  
- Point 5 labeled "triple"  
- A curve connecting the points, with annotations indicating transitions between states.
