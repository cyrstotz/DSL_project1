The thermodynamic mean temperature can be determined as follows:  

O = m_min [(s_in - s_out) * T] / Q_ab  

T = integral from s_a to s_e of T ds  

s_a - s_e = integral from T_in to T_out of c_l divided by T dt = c_l * ln(T_out divided by T_in) = c_l * 0.0341155  

T_bar = s divided by c_l * 0.0341155
