TdS equals S times Q.  

T times (s2 minus s1) equals q12.  

a12 equals h2 minus h1.  

T equals h2 minus h1 divided by s2 minus s1.  

h2 minus h1 equals c times f times (T2 minus T1).  
s2 minus s1 equals c times f times ln (T2 divided by T1).  

Therefore, T equals (T2 minus T1) divided by ln (T2 divided by T1) equals 283.1216 Kelvin.
