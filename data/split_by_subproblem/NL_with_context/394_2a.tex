A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [h2 / kgK]". The graph shows six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 connected by curves.  
- Between points 1 and 2: "isobar bei p3 = p2"  
- Between points 3 and 4: "isobar bei p4 = p5"  
- Between points 5 and 6: "isobar bei p1 = p6"
