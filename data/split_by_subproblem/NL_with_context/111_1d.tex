Consider the entire system after the mass delta m 12 is added. Energy balance:  
Delta E equals minus Q out 12 equals (m total 1 plus delta m 12) times u (T reactor 2) minus m total 1 times u (T reactor 1).  

Delta m 12 equals minus m total 1 minus Q out 12 divided by u (T2) plus m total 1 times u (T1) divided by u (T2).  

Delta m 12 equals minus 5755 minus 35,000 divided by 292.95 plus 5755 times 418.44 divided by 292.95.  

Delta m 12 equals 2355.16 kilograms.
