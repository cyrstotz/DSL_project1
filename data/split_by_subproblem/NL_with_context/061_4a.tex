A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis. The graph shows phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). A curve separates the solid and liquid regions, marked with "geschmolzen" (melted). Another curve separates the liquid and gas regions, labeled "noch nicht gefroren" (not yet frozen). A vertical line is drawn in the liquid region, labeled "Schluss" (end).
