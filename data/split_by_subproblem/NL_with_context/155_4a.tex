The diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph labeled with the following points:  

- The y-axis is labeled as "p [bar]".  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T [K]".  

The graph shows a rectangular cycle with four points labeled sequentially:  
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1.  

- Point 1 is at the top-left corner.  
- Point 2 is at the top-right corner.  
- Point 3 is at the bottom-right corner.  
- Point 4 is at the bottom-left corner.  

Arrows indicate the direction of the cycle, moving clockwise from point 1 to point 4.
