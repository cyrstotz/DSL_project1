Delta E equals Delta U equals Q one two minus W one two.  

m EW multiplied by (h two minus h one) equals Q one two.  

All h one and h two at one point four bar:  
h Fest equals minus three hundred thirty-three point four five eight kilojoules per kilogram.  
h Flüssig equals minus zero point zero four five kilojoules per kilogram.  

h one equals h Flüssig plus x EW one multiplied by (h Fest minus h Flüssig) equals zero point six multiplied by (minus three hundred thirty-three point four five eight minus minus zero point zero four five) equals minus two hundred point zero two eight kilojoules per kilogram.  

h two equals Q one two divided by m EW plus h one equals thirty-five thousand divided by zero point one plus minus two hundred point zero two eight equals three hundred forty-nine thousand point nine seven two minus one hundred eighty-six point four nine three kilojoules per kilogram.  

x EW two equals h two minus h Flüssig divided by (h Fest minus h Flüssig) equals zero point five five eight nine equals zero point five five nine.
