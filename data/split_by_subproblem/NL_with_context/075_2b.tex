The velocity w_6 and temperature T_6 are calculated.  

Given values:  
- w_5 = 220 meters per second  
- p_5 = 0.5 bar  
- T_5 = 431.9 Kelvin  
- p_0 = 0.191 bar  

The process is labeled as "isentrop: S_5 -> S_6."  

Equations:  
m_dot * (h_5 - h_6) + (w_5 squared - w_6 squared) / 2 = 0.  

c_p (T_5 - T_0) + (w_5 squared / 2 - w_6 squared / 2) = 0.  

Polytropic relation:  
T_6 = T_5 * (p_0 / p_5) raised to the power of (n - 1) / n.  

Given:  
n = 1.4.  

Calculation:  
T_6 = 431.9 * (0.191 / 0.5) raised to the power of 0.4 / 1.4 = 328.07 Kelvin.  

Further calculations:  
w_6 squared / 2 = (1.006 * (T_5 - T_6) + w_5 squared / 2).  

Results:  
w_6 = 220.17 meters per second.  

Final boxed values:  
T_6 = 328.07 Kelvin  
w_6 = 220.17 meters per second.
