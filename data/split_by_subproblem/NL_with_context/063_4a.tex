A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled regions:  
- "i)" near the lower part of the curve.  
- "ii)" near the upper part of the curve.  
- "Triple" point marked at the intersection of two curves.  
The curve labeled "isotherm" is drawn horizontally at the bottom of the graph.
