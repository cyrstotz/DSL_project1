A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the y-axis labeled as "p".  

The graph shows a curve representing phase transitions. The curve is labeled "Fest" (solid) on the left side and "Fl√ºssig" (liquid) on the right side.  

Two points are marked on the graph:  
- Point "i" is located above the curve, with an arrow pointing downward to the curve.  
- Point "ii" is located below the curve, with an arrow pointing upward to the curve.  

The curve is labeled "Tripel" (triple point) at the intersection of the phase regions.  

Additional labels include:  
- "gas" below the curve near the right side.
