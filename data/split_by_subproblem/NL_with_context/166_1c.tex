Second law of thermodynamics (SFP):  
O equals m times (se minus sa) plus sigma Q divided by T plus sigma S_erz.  

S_erz equals Q_Aus divided by T_KF minus Q_Aus divided by T_Reaktor.  

Q_Aus equals 65 kilowatts divided by 293 Kelvin minus 65 kilowatts divided by 373 Kelvin equals 0.046 kilojoules per Kelvin.
