A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph depicts a qualitative T-s diagram with four labeled points (1, 2, 3, and 4). The curve starts at point 1, moves to point 2 along an isentropic line, then rises to point 3, and finally descends to point 4.
