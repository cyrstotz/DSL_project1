x2, ice equals the absolute value of (U2 minus U_fest) divided by (U_fl minus U_fest), with T2 equals 0.003 degrees Celsius.  

U2 equals Cv times (T2 minus T1) plus U1, which equals 0.633 times (273.153 minus 773.15) plus (-333.442 plus x1 times (-0.073 plus 333.442)), which equals -449.91 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Therefore, x2, ice equals the absolute value of (-449.91 minus (-333.442)) divided by (-0.073 minus (-333.442)), which equals 0.3943 or approximately 39.43 percent.
