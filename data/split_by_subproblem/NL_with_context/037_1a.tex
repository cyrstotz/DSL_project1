Zero equals m dot times the difference of h out minus h in plus Q R minus Q out.  

Q out equals m dot times the difference of h out minus h in plus Q R.  

h in equals h f at 70 degrees Celsius (from A-2) equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.  

h out equals h f at 100 degrees Celsius (from A-2) equals 479.04 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Therefore, Q out equals 62.182 kilowatts.
