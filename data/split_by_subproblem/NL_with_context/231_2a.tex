A graph is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The x-axis is labeled "S (kJ/kg·K)".  
- The y-axis is labeled "T (K)".  

The graph depicts a qualitative T-s diagram with the following features:  
- Two isobars labeled "P1" and "P2".  
- A section labeled "isobare Wärmezufuhr" (isobaric heat addition).  
- A turbine is marked, with arrows indicating flow direction.  
- A section labeled "Verdichter" (compressor).  
- A horizontal line labeled "T-const" (constant temperature).
