a) T-S Diagram, isobaric units  
[Diagram description]  
The diagram shows a T-S graph with temperature (T) in Kelvin on the y-axis and entropy (S) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the x-axis. The process is labeled with points 1 through 6, connected by lines representing different thermodynamic processes:  
- 1 to 2: adiabatic reversible high-pressure compression  
- 2 to 3: isobaric heat addition  
- 3 to 4: adiabatic irreversible turbine  
- 4 to 5: isobaric mixing chamber  
- 5 to 6: reversible adiabatic nozzle
