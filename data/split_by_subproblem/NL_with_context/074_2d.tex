Exergy loss equals T zero times entropy production.  

Entropy balance:  
Zero equals mass flow rate times [s exit minus s inlet] plus summation of heat transfer divided by temperature plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals mass flow rate times [s inlet minus s exit] minus heat transfer divided by temperature.  

Exergy loss equals T zero times [mass flow rate times (s inlet minus s exit) minus heat transfer divided by temperature].
