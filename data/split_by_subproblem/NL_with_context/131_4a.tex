A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled regions:  
- "Tripelpunkt" (triple point)  
- "subl. unter Tripelpkt" (sublimation below the triple point)  

The graph shows transitions between states labeled "1", "2", and "3".  
- State "1" is connected to state "2" with an isobaric line.  
- State "2" transitions to state "3" with an isothermal line.
