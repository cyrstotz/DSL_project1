The heading reads "stationär 1. HS" (stationary first law of thermodynamics).  

The following equations are written:  
\( 0 = \dot{m}_R (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K \)  
\( \dot{m}_R = \frac{\dot{W}_K}{h_2 - h_3} \)  

It is noted that \( \dot{W}_K = 25 \, \text{W} \).  

Below, the following is written:  
\( h_2 (6 \, \text{K}, x = 1) = \)  
\( h_3 (6 \, \text{K}, 8 \, \text{bar}) = \)  
\( T_3 \approx 55.5 \, \text{°C} \)
