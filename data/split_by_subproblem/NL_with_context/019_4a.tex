A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the y-axis labeled in bar and temperature (T) on the x-axis labeled in Kelvin. The graph depicts a dome-shaped curve representing phase regions. Points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked on the curve. Point 1 is at the bottom left, point 2 is at the bottom right, point 3 is above point 2, and point 4 is above point 1. A horizontal line connects points 3 and 4. The curve is labeled "isobar" near point 3.

COP equals Q dot cool divided by W dot t equals Q dot cool divided by Q dot t minus Q dot cool.
