Exergy loss: Aircraft engine adiabatic.  
Exergy balance:  
Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by exergy at state 0 minus mass flow rate multiplied by exergy at state 6 plus zero minus zero minus exergy loss plus mass flow rate multiplied by delta exergy stream minus exergy loss equals zero.  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals 100 kilojoules per kilogram.
