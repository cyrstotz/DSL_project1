R equals R divided by H equals 83.14 divided by 50 equals 16.28 cubic meters per kilogram Kelvin.  

p_g equals p_1 plus p_EV plus p_amb.  

p_g equals (m_g times g divided by A) plus (m_EW times g divided by A) plus p_amb.  

Filter: A equals 0.008 square meters.  

p_g equals 1.4 bar.  

m_g equals p_g times V_g1 divided by R times T_g1 approximately equals 0.0034 kilograms equals 34 grams.
