A diagram is drawn showing a T-s graph with labeled isobars and process points. The following details are included:  
- Points labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Isobars are labeled as \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), \( p_3 \), \( p_5 \), and \( p_6 \).  
- Processes are described as:  
  - "Isobaric reversible"  
  - "Adiabatic reversible"  
  - "Isobaric irreversible"  
  - "Adiabatic irreversible"  
- Axes are labeled:  
  - The x-axis is labeled \( s \, [\text{kJ/kgK}] \).  
  - The y-axis is labeled \( T \, [\text{K}] \).
