Area equals (0.05 meters squared) times pi equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 meters squared.  

Pressure equals 1 bar plus (32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 meters squared) plus (0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 meters squared).  

Pressure equals 140000 pascals equals 1.4 bar.  

Pressure times volume equals mass times gas constant times temperature. Therefore, mass equals pressure times volume divided by gas constant times temperature.  

Mass of gas equals (140000 pascals times 0.00314 cubic meters) divided by (8.314 joules per mole per kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole times 773.15 kelvin).  

Mass of gas equals 3.42 grams.
