dE/dt equals zero (steady state).  
Qaus equals ṁ multiplied by (he minus ha). Therefore, Qaus equals ṁ multiplied by (ha minus he), which equals negative Qaus.  

c multiplied by ṁ equals negative Qaus divided by ΔT, which equals 6.2182 kJ/s·K.  

dS/dt equals zero.  
Qaus divided by T equals Qaus divided by ṁ multiplied by (se minus sa) plus Ṡerz.  

Qaus divided by ṁ multiplied by (se minus sa) equals Qaus divided by c multiplied by ln(T2/T1).  
T̄ equals 293.72 K.
