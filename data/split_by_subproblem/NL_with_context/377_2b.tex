w₆, T₆  
"NH Turbine Entire Process"  

Equation:  
E = m·ges (h₀ - h₆ + (w₀ squared minus w₆ squared) divided by 2) + Q - W  

Simplified:  
0 = h₀ - h₆ + (w₀ squared minus w₆ squared) divided by 2  

Rearranged:  
w₆ squared divided by 2 = h₀ - h₆ → w₆ = square root of (2 times (h₀ minus h₆) + w₀ squared)  

Further simplification:  
w₆ = square root of (2 times cp times (T₀ minus T₆) + w₀ squared)  

From state 5 to state 6:  
adiabatic reversible → s₅ equals s₆ equals 0  

From state 5 to state 6:  
adiabatic reversible → isentropic → k equals 1.4  

Equation:  
T₆ divided by T₅ equals (p₆ divided by p₅) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n)  

Substituting values:  
T₆ = T₅ times (p₆ divided by p₅) raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k)  

Values:  
T₅ = 431.9 K  
p₀ = p₀ = 0.191 bar  
p₅ = 0.5 bar  

Calculation:  
T₆ = 328.094 K  

Final velocity:  
w₆ = square root of (2 times cp times (T₀ minus T₆) + w₀ squared)  
w₆ = square root of (2 times 1.006 kJ/kg·K times ((30 + 273.15) minus 328.094) + 200 squared meters per second squared)  

Result:  
w₆ = 453.202 meters per second
