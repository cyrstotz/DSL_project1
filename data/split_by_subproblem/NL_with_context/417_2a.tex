A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled as "T" (temperature) and the horizontal axis labeled as "s" (entropy). The graph includes a curve with arrows indicating a process. Specific points are marked along the curve, but no additional labels or descriptions are provided.

h2 equals h (328.075 kilojoules per kilogram)  
equals h (320 kilojoules per kilogram) plus 8.075 times (h (350 kilojoules per kilogram) minus h (320 kilojoules per kilogram)) divided by 10  

equals 320.25 kilojoules per kilogram plus 8.075 times (320.36 kilojoules per kilogram minus 320.25 kilojoules per kilogram) divided by 10  

equals 328.405 kilojoules per kilogram  

w5 equals w0 equals 220 meters per second  

w6 equals the square root of 2 times (h2 minus h6) plus w5 squared  

equals 220.47 meters per second
