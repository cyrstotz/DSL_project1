The page contains two diagrams related to the jet engine process described in Task 2.  

1. **Diagram 1 (T-s Diagram):**  
   - The vertical axis is labeled as "T (°C)" for temperature.  
   - The horizontal axis is labeled as "s (kJ/kgK)" for entropy.  
   - Several isobars are drawn as curved lines across the diagram.  
   - Points are labeled as follows:  
     - Point 0: "0.197 bar, -30°C"  
     - Point 1: "Vorverdichter" (pre-compressor)  
     - Point 2: "Verdichter, isentrop" (compressor, isentropic)  
     - Point 3: "Brennkammer" (combustion chamber)  
     - Point 4: "Turbine"  
     - Point 5: "Mischkammer" (mixing chamber)  
     - Point 6: "Schubdüse" (nozzle)  

   - The process flow is indicated with arrows connecting the points in sequence:  
     0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.  

2. **Diagram 2 (Process Flow):**  
   - The vertical axis is labeled as "p" for pressure.  
   - The horizontal axis is labeled as "T (°C)" for temperature.  
   - Points are labeled similarly to Diagram 1, with the same sequence of processes:  
     - "Vorverdichter" (pre-compressor)  
     - "Verdichter" (compressor)  
     - "Brennkammer" (combustion chamber)  
     - "Turbine"  
     - "Mischkammer" (mixing chamber)  
     - "Schubdüse" (nozzle)  

   - Additional notes are written:  
     - "Brennkammer Turbine, isobare adiabate" (combustion chamber turbine, isobaric adiabatic).  

Both diagrams visually represent the thermodynamic processes occurring in the jet engine as described in Task 2.
