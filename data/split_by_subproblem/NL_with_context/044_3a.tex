Perfect gas:  
p1 = pamb plus (32 times g) divided by (pi divided by 4 times D squared)  
= 1.40059 bar  

Ideal gas state:  
mg = p1 times V1 divided by R times Tg  
R = R divided by Mg = 166.28 kJ divided by kgÂ·K  

= (1.40059 times 3.14 times 10^-3) divided by (166.28 times (500 plus 273.15))  
= 3.436 g
