P_g,2 = P_g,1 = 1.4 bar, because in the state change, no additional mass is given that would counteract P_g (since EW has constant mass and volume).  

T of ice is also constant because the phase state does not change (at constant P and T).  

T_g,2 = T equals DV divided by mRT (because V decreases, T decreases, while the rest remains constant).
