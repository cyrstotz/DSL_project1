A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis. The graph includes labeled points and curves:  
- Point (1) is at the bottom left.  
- Point (2) is connected to point (1) via an isochore labeled "isochore 1."  
- Point (3) is connected to point (2) via a curve labeled "isochore 2."  
- Point (4) is connected to point (3) via a horizontal line.  
- Point (4) is connected back to point (1) via another curve.
