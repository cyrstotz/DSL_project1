Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with labeled regions. The graph includes shaded areas and lines, but no specific labels are visible.  
2. The second diagram is another pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with labeled regions:  
   - "Fl√ºssig" (Liquid)  
   - "Nass-dampf" (Wet steam)  
   - "Gas" (Gas)  
   Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked on the graph.
