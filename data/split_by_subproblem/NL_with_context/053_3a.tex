Phi equals p sub g times V sub g1 equals m sub g times R times T sub g1.  

p sub g1 equals 1 bar plus m sub EW times g divided by A plus m sub g times g divided by A equals 100000 pascals plus 0.6 times 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 25 times 10 to the power of negative 4 meters squared plus 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 25 times 10 to the power of negative 4 meters squared.  

p sub g1 equals 1.40094 bar.  

m sub g1 equals p sub g1 times V sub g1 divided by R times T sub g1 equals 0.008422 kilograms.  

R equals R divided by M.  

V sub g1 equals 3.14 liters equals 0.00314 cubic meters.
