The gas transfers heat \( Q \) to melt part of the ice. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the temperature of the gas and the ice-water mixture are equal:  
\( T_{g,2} = T_{EW,2} \)  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{EW,2} \)  

The energy balance of the system is:  
\( \dot{E} = \frac{d}{dt} (\text{PE} + \text{KE} + \text{UE}) = \dot{Q} - \dot{W} \)  
Thus:  
\( \Delta \dot{Q} = \Delta Q \)  

Perfect gas:  
Internal energy depends only on temperature, so the temperature change of the gas is directly proportional to the heat transfer.  

Energy balance of the ice-water system:  
\( \dot{E} = \frac{d}{dt} (\text{PE} + \text{KE} + \text{UE}) = \dot{Q} - \dot{W} \)  
Thus:  
\( \Delta \dot{Q} = \Delta Q - \dot{W} \)  

The change in internal energy of the ice-water system is equal to the heat transferred plus the work done by the system against external forces:  
\( \Delta U = Q_{EW,12} + (V_{EW,2} - V_{EW,1}) \)  

Note:  
\( V_{EW,1} = V_{EW,2} \), as the volume of the ice-water mixture is incompressible.  
Thus, the heat transferred from the gas to the ice-water mixture is:  
\( Q_{12} = Q_{EW,12} \)

System ice-water mixture:  
\( Q_{EW,12} = x_{EW,1} \cdot m_{EW} \cdot h_{x} \approx -200.03 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

System gas:  
\( \Delta U_{gas} = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot \Delta T = m_g \cdot c_V \cdot (T_{EW,2} - T_{g,1}) \)
