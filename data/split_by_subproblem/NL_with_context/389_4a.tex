Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph. It shows phase regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gas" (gas). The triple point (TP) is marked, and the transitions between phases are indicated.  
2. The second diagram is another p-T graph with similar labels ("fest," "flüssig," "gas") and the triple point (TP). Points labeled "1" and "2" are marked, showing transitions between phases.
