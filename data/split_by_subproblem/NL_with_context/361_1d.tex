- Energy balance for closed system:  
  Change in energy equals heat flow minus work plus mass flow rate times enthalpy.  
  Mass flow rate equals mass at state 1 plus change in mass.  
  Change in mass equals mass flow rate.  

- Equation:  
  Change in mass times (enthalpy at inlet minus enthalpy at exit) equals mass times (internal energy at exit minus internal energy at inlet).  
  Change in mass equals total mass times (enthalpy at inlet minus enthalpy at exit) divided by (internal energy at exit minus internal energy at inlet).  

- Parameters:  
  Enthalpy at inlet equals enthalpy at 20 degrees Celsius equals 83.96 kilojoules per kilogram.  
  Internal energy at exit equals internal energy at 70 degrees Celsius equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.  
  Internal energy at inlet equals internal energy at 100 degrees Celsius equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.  
  Reference: Table A-2.  

- Final calculation:  
  Change in mass equals 5755 times (292.98 minus 419.04) divided by (83.96 minus 292.98) equals 316.49 kilograms.
