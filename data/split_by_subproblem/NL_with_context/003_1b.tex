T_KF equals the integral from T_a to T_e of T multiplied by dS divided by (S_a minus S_e) equals (h_a minus h_e) divided by (S_a minus S_e).  

This equals the integral from T_1 to T_2 of c_p of T multiplied by dT divided by T equals c_p multiplied by (T_2 minus T_1) divided by ln(T_2 divided by T_1).  

T_KF equals (298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin) divided by ln(298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin) equals 293.12 Kelvin.
