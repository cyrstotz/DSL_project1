A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled regions and lines:  
- A line labeled "Triple Point" is marked.  
- Two processes are shown: "Isobar" and "Isotherm."  
- Points labeled 1, 2, and 3 are marked on the graph.  
- The temperature \( T_i \) is indicated as the interior temperature of the freeze dryer.
