The mass flow rate \( \dot{m}_{R134a} \) is calculated using an energy balance at the compressor (stationary).  

The equation is written as:  
\( 0 = \dot{m}_{R134a} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) + \dot{Q}_{radial} + \dot{W}_k \).  

The term \( \dot{Q}_{radial} \) is crossed out.  

Rearranging gives:  
\( \dot{m}_{R134a} = \frac{\dot{W}_k}{h_3 - h_2} \).  

Values are provided:  
\( h_2 = h_f (-22^\circ C) = 271.77 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

\( h_3 = \) (no value provided).
