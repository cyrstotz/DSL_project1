p_g1 equals p_amb plus m_K divided by A equals seven point five zero six plus (thirty-two times zero point one zero times nine point eight seven) divided by (ten point one times pi) equals seven point one six bar.  

m_g equals p_g1 times V_g1 divided by R times T_g1 equals seven point five zero six times zero point zero zero three one four divided by (eight point five one four times fifty divided by (five hundred plus two hundred seventy-three point one five)) equals zero point zero zero three six six kilograms.
