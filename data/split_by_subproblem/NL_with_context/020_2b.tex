Adiabatic reversible => isentropic  
=> T2 / T1 = (p2 / p1) raised to the power of (k minus 1) divided by k  
=> T6 = T5 multiplied by (p6 / p5) raised to the power of (k minus 1) divided by k  
=> p6 = p0 = 0.191 bar  

T6 = 431.9 K multiplied by (0.191 bar / 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1) divided by 1.4  
= 328.1 K  

=> w6
