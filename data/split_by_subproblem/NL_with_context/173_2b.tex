The following equation is written:  
dE/dt = Σṁ (h + ke + pe) + ΣQ̇ - ΣẆ  

Then simplified to:  
0 = ṁ (he - ha + we squared divided by 2 - wa squared divided by 2)  

Further simplified to:  
we = square root of (2 (he - ha + wa squared divided by 2))  

Additional notes:  
he is referenced as "Tab A-22".  

Values are calculated:  
- X1 = 240 K  
- X2 = 243.15 K  
- X3 = 250 K  

Interpolation formula:  
y = (x - x1) divided by (x2 - x1) multiplied by (y2 - y1) plus y1  

Substituted values:  
y = (243.17945 - 240) divided by (243.15 - 240) multiplied by (250.05 - 210.02) plus 210.02  

Result:  
he = 243.17945 [kJ/kg]  

Additional note:  
wLuft = 200 m/s.
