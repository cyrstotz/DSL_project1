Entropy production during heat transfer:  

Without mass flow, stationary:  
Sigma equals sum of Q dot divided by T_i plus Sigma dot.  

Sigma dot equals negative Q dot divided by T_reactor plus Q dot divided by T_KF equals 45.15 watts.  

Diagram: A schematic showing heat transfer Q through the reactor wall.  

Q equals 62.182 kilowatts.
