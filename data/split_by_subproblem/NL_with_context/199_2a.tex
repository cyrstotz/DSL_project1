A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin).  
- Points are labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Curved lines connect the points, representing thermodynamic processes.  
- Isobars are shown for \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_3 \), and \( p_5 \).
