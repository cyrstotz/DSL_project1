Since no additional force is applied, the process in the cylinder is isobaric, and the density of water remains constant. Therefore, \( p_{eis} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).  

Since the system remains in the ice-water region, in state 2, \( T_{2w} = T_{2m} = 0^\circ \text{C} \), and the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium.  

Thus, \( T_{2w} = T_{2g} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).
