Triple point: 0°C  
\( T_{\text{sub}} \) (water) = -20°C  
Constant \( T_i \) with 10K above \( T_{\text{sub}} \), \( T_i = -10°C \)  

Diagram:  
A pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram is drawn.  
- The triple point is labeled.  
- The regions are marked as "Gas," "Sublimation," "Isotherm," "Frost Fusion," and "Solid."  
- The curve transitions from frost fusion to sublimation, with arrows indicating directions.
