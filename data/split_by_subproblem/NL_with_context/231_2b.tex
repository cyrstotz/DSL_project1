The heading reads "Fließprozess stationär" (steady-state flow process).  

An equation is written:  
O equals m-dot multiplied by (he minus ha plus (w6 squared minus w5 squared divided by 2)) plus the sum of Qi minus the sum of Ew.  

Another equation is written:  
Negative Q_B divided by m-dot equals (he at T5 minus ha at T6) plus (w6 squared minus w5 squared divided by 2).  

Values are provided:  
T5 equals 431.9 K.  

An equation for T5 is written:  
T5 equals T5 divided by T5 multiplied by (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.  

T5 equals 431.8 multiplied by (0.191 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1) divided by 1.4.  

T6 equals 328.0747 K, which is simplified to 328.088 K.  

An equation for he at T5 is written:  
he at T5 equals h at 490 plus (431.9 minus 430) divided by (490 minus 430) multiplied by (h at 490 minus h at 430).  

The result is 433.364 kJ.  

An equation for ha at T6 is written:  
ha at T6 equals h at 330 plus (328.088 minus 325) divided by (330 minus 325) multiplied by (h at 330 minus h at 325).  

The result is 328.38 kJ.  

Another equation is written:  
w6 squared equals w5 squared plus (he at T5 minus ha at T6) plus Q_B divided by m-dot plus w6 squared.  

A question is posed:  
m-dot equals question mark.
