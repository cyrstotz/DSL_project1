A diagram is drawn with temperature (T in Kelvin) on the y-axis and entropy (S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) on the x-axis. The process is labeled with points 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Point 0 is marked as "isobar" with \( p_0/p_6 \).  
- Point 2 is labeled "isentrope" and "training."  
- Point 3 is labeled "adiabate."  
- Point 4 is labeled "mixing."  
- Point 5 is labeled "isentrope."  
- Point 6 is labeled "isobar."  
Dashed lines connect points 0 and 6, indicating an isobaric process.
