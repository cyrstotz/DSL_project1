From the energy balance:  
0 = ṁ [he - ha + (we squared - wa squared) divided by 2] I + Σ Q̇j - Σ Ẇen = 0.  

- Q̇j is crossed out.  
- Ẇt = 0.  
- q = 1195 kJ/kg.  
- We = wLuft = 200 m/s.  

(we squared - wa squared) divided by 2 = ha - he - q.  
= cp (Ta - Te) - q.  

From 5 to 6, isentropic:  
T6 divided by T5 = (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n - 1) divided by n.  
= (p0 divided by p5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4.  
= [(0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4].  
= 0.76.  

T6 = T5 multiplied by 0.76 = 0.76 multiplied by 431.9 K = 328.07 K.

(w6 squared minus w5 squared divided by 2) equals CpL times (T6 minus T5).  
Equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (328.07 minus 431.91) Kelvin.  
Equals negative 104.45 kilojoules per kilogram.  

w6 equals the square root of (2 times negative 104.45 kilojoules per kilogram plus w5 squared).  
Equals 510 meters per second.
