The transition from state 5 to state 6 is described with equations:  
0 equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy at state 5 minus enthalpy at state 6) plus (velocity at state 5 squared minus velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2) plus heat flow.  
0 equals mass flow rate times (specific heat capacity times (temperature at state 5 minus temperature at state 0)) plus (velocity at state 5 squared divided by 2 minus velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2).  

An ideal gas equation is written:  
Pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at state 5 raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k) equals temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 5.  

Temperature at state 6 equals pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at state 5 raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k) times temperature at state 5.  

The calculated temperature at state 6 is underlined:  
328.07 Kelvin.  

An additional term is written:  
Velocity at state 6 squared divided by 2 equals... (unfinished).
