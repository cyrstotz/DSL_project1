2. HS: \( 0 = s_e - s_a + q / T + s_{0z} \)  

\( s_{0z} = \Delta s_{0z} = c_p \cdot \ln(T_6 / T_0) - R \cdot \ln(p_6 / p_0) \)  

\( = 0.3014 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)  

\( e_{y,verl} = T_0 \cdot s_{0z} \)  
\( = 73.276 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)

A graph is drawn at the bottom right corner, showing a T-s diagram with labeled points 0, 2, 4, and 6. The curve starts at point 0, rises to point 2, then moves to point 4, and finally to point 6.
