A graph is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "p(pas)" (pressure in pascals).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "T(CÂ°)" (temperature in degrees Celsius).  

The graph shows a curve representing phase regions. The curve is divided into sections labeled "fusion" and "gas." Points labeled "1," "2," and "3" are marked along the curve, with arrows indicating transitions between these states.
