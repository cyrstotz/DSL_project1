A T-s diagram is drawn with the following details:  
- The y-axis is labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]".  
- The diagram shows a thermodynamic process with points labeled 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The process includes:  
  - "isotrop" (adiabatic) lines between points 0 to 2, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6.  
  - "isobar" (constant pressure) lines between points 2 to 3 and 5 to 4.  
  - A curved line connecting points 0 to 6, labeled "isobar".
