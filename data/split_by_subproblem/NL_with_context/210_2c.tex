Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream at state 6 minus exergy stream at state 0.  

exergy stream equals h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0).  

exergy stream equals h subscript c minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0), which equals Delta exergy stream.  

h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 equals c subscript p multiplied by (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0).  

s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0 equals c subscript p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 0).  

Since p subscript 6 equals p subscript 0:  

Delta exergy stream equals c subscript p multiplied by (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0)).  

Delta exergy stream equals 1.006 multiplied by (340 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin multiplied by the natural logarithm of (340 Kelvin divided by 243.15 Kelvin)) multiplied by kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Delta exergy stream equals 115.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
