A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "s in kJ/kgÂ·K" and the y-axis labeled as "T in K". The graph shows several curves labeled as isobars with corresponding pressures:  
- \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
The points are marked as 2, 3, 5, and the curves are connected to represent the process qualitatively.
