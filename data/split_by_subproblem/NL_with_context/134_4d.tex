The text reads:  
"m dot times (h2 minus h3) plus Q dot minus W dot equals 0.  
m dot times (Ti equals 0 degrees Celsius)."  

No additional content or diagrams are present.

εu = Qz divided by (Qab minus Qz) = Qz divided by w1 = Qz divided by (Qab minus Qz) = Qz divided by 28W.  

Qz = ṁ times (h1 minus h2).
