Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled "a)" and shows a T (temperature in Kelvin) versus S (entropy) graph.  
   - The curve starts at point 1 and moves to point 2, then to point 3, and finally to point 5.  
   - Points are labeled as follows:  
     - Point 1: Initial state.  
     - Point 2: Intermediate state.  
     - Point 3: High-pressure state labeled as "P3".  
     - Point 5: Final state labeled as "P".  
   - The graph includes curved lines connecting the points and arrows indicating the direction of the process.  

2. The second diagram is labeled "a)" and shows another T versus S graph.  
   - The curve starts at point 1 and moves to point 2, then to point 3, point 4, and finally to point 6.  
   - Points are labeled as follows:  
     - Point 1: Initial state.  
     - Point 2: Intermediate state.  
     - Point 3: High-pressure state labeled as "P3".  
     - Point 4: Intermediate state labeled as "P0 = P6".  
     - Point 6: Final state.  
   - The graph includes curved lines connecting the points and arrows indicating the direction of the process.
