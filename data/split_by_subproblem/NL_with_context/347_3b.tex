\( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} \), as the system is in equilibrium in state 2.  

Water in state 1: \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) with \( x > 0 \), meaning it is in a two-phase state.  

From Table 1:  
At \( 0^\circ \text{C} \), \( p_{\text{EW}} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \) (makes sense, as slightly less pressure is applied).  

State 2: \( p_{\text{EW}} = p_{\text{amb}} \), as the system remains in a two-phase state. Therefore:  
\( T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW},2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.401 \, \text{bar} \), as this includes the membrane and piston, which are frictionless, and the mass acting on the gas remains approximately constant.
