Given: Heat flow through the reactor wall to the coolant.  

A diagram is drawn showing the reactor and cooling jacket. Arrows indicate the inlet and outlet flows of the coolant and the heat flow \( Q_{out} \) through the reactor wall. Labels include \( T_{KF,in} \), \( T_{KF,out} \), \( \dot{m}_{in} \), and \( \dot{m}_{out} \).  

Steady-state energy balance with mass conservation:  
\( \dot{Q}_{out} = \dot{m}_{in} (h_{out} - h_{in}) + \dot{Q}_R \)  

\( \dot{Q}_{out} = \dot{m}_{in} (h_{out} - h_{in}) + \dot{Q}_R \)  

From water tables:  
\( h_{in} = h(70^\circ C) = 292.88 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
\( h_{out} = h(100^\circ C) = 419.04 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

Calculation:  
\( \dot{Q}_{out} = 0.3 \cdot (419.04 - 292.88) - 100 \, \text{kW} \)  
\( \dot{Q}_{out} = 62.182 \, \text{kW} \)
