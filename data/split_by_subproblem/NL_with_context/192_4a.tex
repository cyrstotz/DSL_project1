The page contains two diagrams:

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled as `p` (pressure) on the vertical axis and `T` (temperature) on the horizontal axis.  
   - A triangular region is drawn with two intersecting lines forming the boundaries.  
   - Inside the triangular region, a curved line is drawn, labeled as `NO`.  
   - The diagram appears to represent phase regions.

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled as `p` (pressure) on the vertical axis and `T` (temperature) on the horizontal axis.  
   - A horizontal line is drawn at a constant pressure, starting at a point labeled `Ti` on the temperature axis.  
   - The line extends to the right, indicating a relationship between pressure and temperature.
