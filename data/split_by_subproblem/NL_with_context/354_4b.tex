The mass flow rate of R134a is denoted as \( \dot{m}_{R134a} \).  

The temperature in the evaporator is described:  
- \( T_i - 6K \).  

The temperature values are noted:  
- From the diagram: \( T_i = -10^\circ C \).  
- \( T_f = -16^\circ C \).  

From \( x_2 = n \), entropy and enthalpy are determined using Table A-10:  
- \( s_g(-16^\circ C) = 0.5298 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).  
- \( h_g(-16^\circ C) = 237.74 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

Since the compressor is adiabatic and reversible, the following applies:  
- \( s_2 = s_3 \).

From Table A-12, the enthalpy can now be determined using the entropy. It is known from A-10 that:

s2 equals s3 equals 6.528 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

h3 equals h(8 bar, 40 degrees Celsius) minus h(8 bar, saturated) divided by (s3 minus s(8 bar, saturated)) plus h(8 bar, saturated).

s(8 bar, 40 degrees Celsius) minus s(8 bar, saturated).

h3 equals 277.37 kilojoules per kilogram.

Therefore, for the balance equation under the compressor, assuming adiabatic conditions:

0 equals mass flow rate times (h2 minus h3) plus Q minus power.

Mass flow rate equals power divided by (h2 minus h3) equals 8.34 times 10 to the power of negative 4 kilograms per second.
