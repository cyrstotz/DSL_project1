Exergy loss:  
ex_verl = T_0 multiplied by Delta s_verl  
T_0 = 243.15 Kelvin  

Delta s_verl from entropy balance:  
0 = m_dot multiplied by (s_e minus s_a) plus Q_dot divided by T_m plus s_dot_erz  

Delta s_verl = (s_a minus s_e) minus Q_dot divided by T_m = (s_6 minus s_0) minus Q_dot divided by T_m  

Entropy difference:  
s_6 minus s_0 = 0.337 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 1.195 divided by 1289 Kelvin  

Delta s_verl = -0.59  

Exergy loss:  
ex_verl = 243.15 Kelvin multiplied by Delta s_verl  

Final result:  
ex_verl = -0.59
