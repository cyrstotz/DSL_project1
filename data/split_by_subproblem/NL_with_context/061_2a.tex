A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "S" and the y-axis labeled as "T". The units for the x-axis are "kJ/kgÂ·K".  

The graph depicts a qualitative T-S diagram with six labeled points:  
- Point 1 is at the lower left.  
- Point 2 is slightly higher and to the right of Point 1, connected by a slanted line.  
- Point 3 is higher and further to the right, connected by a curved line.  
- Point 4 is at the peak of the curve, representing the highest temperature.  
- Point 5 is lower and to the right of Point 4, connected by a downward curve.  
- Point 6 is at the bottom right, connected by a steep slanted line.  

The process between Points 2 and 3 is shaded with diagonal lines, indicating a specific region of interest.
