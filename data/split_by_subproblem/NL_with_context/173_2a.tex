A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as "S [kJ/kg·K]".  
- The y-axis is labeled as "T [K]".  

The diagram includes several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked.  
- Isobars are labeled as "Isobare p0 = p6", "Isobare p4 = p5", and "Isobare p2 = p3".  
- Arrows indicate transitions between the points.  

Below the diagram, a table is partially filled:  
- Row 0: T = -30°C, p = 0.191 bar.  
- Row 5: T = 158.75, p = 0.5.  
- Row 6: p = 0.191.
