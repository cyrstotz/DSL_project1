The heading reads "7. HS Aktivierung:"  
The following equations are written:  

0 = m dot times [h sub s minus h sub 6 plus (w sub s squared minus w sub 6 squared) divided by 2]  

0 = h sub s minus h sub 6 plus (w sub s squared divided by 2 minus w sub 6 squared divided by 2)  

w sub s squared = 2 times [h sub s minus h sub 6 plus w sub 6 squared]  

w sub s squared = square root of [2 times c sub p times (T sub s minus T sub 6) plus w sub s squared]  

T sub s = T sub s divided by P sub c raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k)  

T sub s = 437.9 Kelvin divided by (0.5 bar divided by 0.791 bar) raised to the power of 0.2 equals 328 Kelvin  

w sub 6 = square root of [2 times 7.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (437.9 Kelvin minus 328 Kelvin) plus 220 squared meters per second]  

w sub 6 = 220.9 meters per second
