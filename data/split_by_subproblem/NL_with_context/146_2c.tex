Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream at state 6 minus exergy stream at state 0.  
Exergy stream at state 6 minus exergy stream at state 0 equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0) plus w6 squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

h6 equals 328.4 kilojoules per kilogram.  
w6 equals 510 meters per second.  
T6 equals 340 Kelvin.  
h0 equals 243.15 kilojoules per kilogram.  
T0 equals 243.15 Kelvin.  
w0 equals 200 meters per second.  

Delta exergy stream equals cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0) minus T0 multiplied by (cp multiplied by ln(T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by ln(p6 divided by p0)) plus w6 squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

[1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by (340 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin) minus 243.15 Kelvin multiplied by (1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by ln(340 Kelvin divided by 243.15 Kelvin) minus R multiplied by ln(p6 divided by p0))] plus (510 meters per second squared divided by 2 minus 200 meters per second squared divided by 2).  

Equals 12,127.8 joules equals 12,127 kilojoules per kilogram.
