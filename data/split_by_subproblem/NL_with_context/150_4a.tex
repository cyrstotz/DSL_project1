A pressure-temperature diagram is drawn. The diagram includes labeled regions:  
- "Fest" (solid phase)  
- "Flüssig" (liquid phase)  
- "Gasförmig" (gaseous phase)  

The diagram shows:  
- An isobaric process labeled "i"  
- An isothermal process labeled "ii"  
- The triple point labeled "Tripel"  

The axes are labeled:  
- Vertical axis: "P" (pressure)  
- Horizontal axis: "T" (temperature)  

Below the diagram, the label "Abb. 5" is written.
