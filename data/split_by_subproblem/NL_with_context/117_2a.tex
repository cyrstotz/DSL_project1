w Luft equals 200 meters per second.  
p0 equals 0.191 bar.  
T0 equals negative 30 degrees Celsius.  

A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as T (degrees Celsius) and the x-axis labeled as s (kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin). The graph shows a process diagram with six numbered points connected by lines. The following annotations are present:  
- Between points 2 and 3, the label "p2/p3 isobaren" is written.  
- Near point 1, the label "p1" is written.  

Below the graph, a table is drawn with the following column headers:  
- p (bar)  
- T (degrees Celsius)  
- q (kilojoules per kilogram)  
- s (kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin)  

The rows of the table contain the following data:  
Row 0: p equals 0.191, T equals negative 30 degrees Celsius.  
Row 1: (empty).  
Row 2: q equals 1195 kilojoules per kilogram.  
Row 3: (empty).  
Row 4: p equals 0.5.  
Row 5: p equals 0.5, T equals 431.9 Kelvin.  
Row 6: (empty).  

Additional annotations:  
- Near row 2, the label "adiabat isentrop WG: Î·v < 1" is written.  
- Near row 5, the label "isobar" is written.
