Delta exergy flow equals exergy flow at state 6 minus exergy flow at state 0.  

exergy flow at state 0 equals zero.  

Delta exergy equals h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus w subscript 6 squared minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy equals c subscript p multiplied by (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) minus T subscript 0 multiplied by c subscript p multiplied by ln(T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) plus w subscript 6 squared minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2.  

T subscript 0 equals 243 Kelvin, w subscript 0 equals 200 meters per second.  

Delta exergy equals 1100.65 kilojoules per kilogram equals 110 kilojoules per kilogram.
