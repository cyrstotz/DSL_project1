A second graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled "T" and the x-axis labeled "s". Several curves are sketched, resembling isobars. Points are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The following annotations are included:  
- p0 = p6  
- p1  
- p2 = p3  
- p4 = p5  
- "isobars" written near the curves.  

Additional text: "MPAT" written near the graph.

\( \Delta ex_{\text{str}} = h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + w_6^2 / 2 \)  
\( \Delta ex_{\text{str}} = \text{cp} (T_6 - T_0) - T_0 \cdot \text{cp} \ln \left( \frac{T_6}{T_0} \right) + w_6^2 / 2 - w_0^2 / 2 \)  
\( \Delta ex_{\text{str}} = 46.533 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

\( T_0 = -30^\circ \text{C} \)  
\( T_0 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \)  
\( p_0 = p_6 \)
