Pressure remains constant: \( \Rightarrow \) same conditions as in state 1.  

\( m_g / A + \dots \)  

Since the volume is smaller, the gas law follows that \( T_2 \) is smaller:  
\( T_2 / T_1 = (p_2 / p_1)^{(n-1)/n} \)  

\( T_2 = T_1 \cdot (p_2 / p_1)^{0.2627} \)  

\( n = \frac{c_p}{c_v} = \frac{\kappa + c_v}{c_v} = 1.2627 \)  

\( T_2 = 273.15312 \, \text{K} \)
