A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a phase diagram with labeled regions:  
- Point 1: "Fl√ºssig x=0" (Liquid x=0)  
- Point 2: "Dampf" (Vapor)  
- Point 3: A point at the top of the curve.  
The curve connects points 1, 2, and 3, representing transitions between phases.
