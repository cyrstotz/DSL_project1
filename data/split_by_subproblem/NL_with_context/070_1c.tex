O equals integral from s2 to s1 plus Q divided by T plus S erz.  
S erz equals integral from s1 to s2.  
Equals 0.7056 minus Q divided by T g.  
Equals 0.7056 plus 61.182 divided by 275.  
Equals 0.3764163 kilojoules per kelvin.  
Equals 376.39 joules per kelvin.

T bar equals the integral of T dS divided by the integral of dS, which equals the integral from Tc to Ta of c divided by T dT divided by c times the natural logarithm of Ta divided by Tc.  

This equals Q divided by c times the natural logarithm of Ta divided by Tc, which equals epsilon times (Ta minus Tc) divided by c times the natural logarithm of Ta divided by Tc, which equals Ta minus Tc divided by the natural logarithm of Ta divided by Tc.
