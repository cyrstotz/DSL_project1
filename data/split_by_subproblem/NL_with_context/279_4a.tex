Two diagrams are drawn, both labeled with axes "P" (pressure) on the vertical axis and "T" (temperature) on the horizontal axis.  

**First Diagram:**  
- The diagram shows phase regions labeled "Eis" (ice), "Wasser" (water), and "Dampf" (vapor).  
- A line labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point) is marked at the intersection of the three phase regions.  
- Points labeled "1", "2", and "3" are connected by arrows, forming a path through the phase regions.  
- The path starts in the "Eis" region, moves through "Wasser", and ends in "Dampf".  
- Additional labels include "Wasser Eis" and "Wasser Dampf".  

**Second Diagram:**  
- Similar phase regions are labeled "Eis" (ice), "Wasser" (water), and "Dampf" (vapor).  
- Points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4" are connected by arrows, forming a path through the phase regions.  
- The path starts in the "Eis" region, moves through "Wasser", and ends in "Dampf".  
- A line labeled "b2" is marked in the "Eis" region.
