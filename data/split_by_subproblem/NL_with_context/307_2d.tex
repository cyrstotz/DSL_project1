Exergy balance:  

0 equals m dot times negative delta exergy stream plus the sum over j of one minus T zero divided by T j times Q dot j minus the sum of m dot h in minus E dot exergy loss.  

Thus, E dot exergy loss equals negative m dot times delta exergy stream.  

For exergy loss equals negative delta exergy stream equals negative 100 kilojoules per kilogram.
