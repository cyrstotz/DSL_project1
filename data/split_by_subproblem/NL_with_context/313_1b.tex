The thermodynamic mean temperature \( \bar{T} \) is calculated as:  
\[ \bar{T} = \frac{\int_a^b T \, ds}{S_a - S_e} \]  
This is equivalent to:  
\[ \bar{T} = \frac{\int_a^b dH \, \text{(isobar)}}{S_a - S_e} \]  
Which simplifies further to:  
\[ \bar{T} = \frac{h_e - h_a}{S_a - S_e} = \frac{c_p \int T \, dT}{c_p \, \ln(T_2 / T_1)} = \frac{c_p (T_2 - T_1)}{c_p \, \ln(T_2 / T_1)} \]  
Final result:  
\[ \bar{T} = 283.12 \, \text{K} \]
