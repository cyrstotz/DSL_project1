Energy balance (EB) at a piston:  
From the general equation:  
\( \frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \dot{Q}_j - \sum \dot{W}_n \)  

\( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = \sum Q_j - \sum W_n \)  

\( E_2 - E_1 = Q_{12} - W_{12} \implies Q_{12} = E_2 - E_1 + W_{12} \)  

System boundary: only gas  
(Diagram: a rectangle labeled "Gas" with a membrane separating it.)  

\( \Delta E = Q_{12} - W_{12} \)
