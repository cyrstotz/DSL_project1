An equation is written:  
Delta ex_str equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0) plus w6 squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

Another equation is written:  
h6 minus h0 equals cp_Luft times (T6 minus T0).  

Substitution is shown:  
cp_Luft equals 1.006 times (340 minus 233.15) equals 97.43 kJ/kg.  

An entropy equation is written:  
s6 minus s0 equals cp_Luft times ln(Tc divided by T0) minus k times ln(Pc divided by P0).  

Substitution is shown:  
cp_Luft equals 1.006 times ln(340 divided by 233.15) equals 0.3373 kJ divided by kgÂ·K.

Delta ex_str equals 97430 minus 243.15 times 337.3 plus 510 squared divided by 2 minus 200 squared divided by 2.  

Equals 125469.5 joules per kilogram equals 125.47 kilojoules per kilogram.
