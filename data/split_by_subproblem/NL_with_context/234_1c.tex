Entropy production in the wall:  
Heat flow out equals 293.12 Kelvin.  
Heat flow out equals 100 degrees Celsius.  

Entropy balance for steady-state flow process:  
Zero equals mass flow rate times (entropy inlet minus entropy outlet) plus heat flow out divided by thermodynamic mean temperature plus heat flow out divided by reactor temperature plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals heat flow out times (one divided by thermodynamic mean temperature minus one divided by reactor temperature).  

Entropy production equals 53.91 watts per Kelvin.
