A graph is drawn with temperature (T) in Kelvin on the y-axis and entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the x-axis.  
- The graph includes labeled isobars:  
  - Isobar \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - Isobar \( p_0 = p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
- Points labeled as 5 and 6 are marked on the graph.  
- An isentropic (adiabatic and reversible) process is indicated between points 5 and 6.  
- The temperature values 431.9 K and 243.15 K are marked on the y-axis.
