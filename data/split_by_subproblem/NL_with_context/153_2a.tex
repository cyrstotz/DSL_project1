A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the y-axis labeled as [L]/[c], and entropy (S) on the x-axis labeled as [L]/[c]. Several isobars are marked:  
- Isobar \( p_2/p_3 \)  
- Isobar \( p_5 = p_4 \)  
- Isobar \( p_0 = p_0 \)  

Points are labeled as 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and arrows indicate transitions between these states.  

Equations are written:  
\[
\dot{p} = \frac{\dot{V}}{nRT}
\]  
\[
T = \frac{\rho V^{\kappa - 1}}{nR}
\]
