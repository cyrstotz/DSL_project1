A equals pi times open parenthesis D divided by 2 close parenthesis squared equals 25 pi centimeters squared equals 25 pi times 10 to the power of negative 4 meters squared.  

Poben equals open parenthesis mK plus mEW close parenthesis times g divided by A plus Pamb equals open parenthesis 32 kilograms plus 0.1 kilograms close parenthesis times 9.81 newtons per kilogram divided by 25 pi times 10 to the power of negative 4 meters squared plus 1 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals approximately equals 140 kilopascals equals 1.4 bar.  

Mechanical equilibrium:  
Pg1 equals Poben approximately equals 1.4 bar.  

Rg equals R divided by Mg equals 8.314 joules per mole per kelvin divided by 50 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms per mole equals 166.28 joules per kilogram per kelvin.  

Mg equals Pg1 times Vg1 divided by Rg times Tg1 equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 166.28 joules per kilogram per kelvin times 773.15 kelvin approximately equals 0.0034 kilograms equals 3.4 grams.
