A diagram is drawn with the title "a) T-s". The x-axis is labeled "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" and the y-axis is labeled "T [K]". The diagram represents a thermodynamic process with labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 2 connected to point 0 with a dashed line labeled "isentrop".  
- Point 3 connected to point 2 with a solid line labeled "isobar".  
- Point 5 connected to point 3 with a solid line.  
- Point 6 connected to point 5 with a solid line labeled "isentrop".
