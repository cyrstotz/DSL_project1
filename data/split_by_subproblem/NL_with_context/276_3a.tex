Tg equals 500 degrees Celsius.  
Vg equals 3.14 liters.  

pg Vg equals Mg times R divided by M times Tg.  

A equals (D divided by 2) squared times pi equals 0.00785 square meters.  

**Diagram Description:**  
A rectangular diagram labeled "Kr√§ftegleichgewicht" (force equilibrium) is shown.  
- The top arrow points downward and is labeled "pamb times A".  
- The middle arrow points downward and is labeled "Mk times g".  
- The bottom arrow points upward and is labeled "pg times A".  
The text next to the diagram states "im Gleichgewicht" (in equilibrium).  

pg times A equals pamb times A plus Mk times g.  

pg equals pamb plus Mk times g divided by A.  
g equals 9.81 meters per second squared.  

pg equals 1393870 pascals.  
pg equals 1.4 bar.  

Mg equals pg times Vg divided by R divided by M times Tg.  

Mg equals 3.429 grams equals 3.42 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms.  

pg equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals.  
Vg equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.  

R equals 8.314 joules per mole per kelvin.  
M equals 50 kilograms per kilomole.  
Tg equals 773.15 kelvin.
