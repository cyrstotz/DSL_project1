Adiabatic reversible sublimation → s subscript s equals s subscript c.  
Ideal gas → polytropic equation:  
T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 5 equals (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  
This implies T subscript 6 equals T subscript 5 multiplied by (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

Calculation:  
T subscript 6 equals 328.07 K.  

Energy balance in sublimation:  
0 equals m subscript g multiplied by [(w subscript 6 squared minus w subscript 5 squared divided by 2) plus h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6] minus W dot subscript s subscript c.
