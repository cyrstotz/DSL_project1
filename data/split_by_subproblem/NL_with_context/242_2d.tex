Exergy balance:  

\( O = ex_{str,0-6} + ex_{R,Q} - ex_{verl} \)  

\( ex_{verl} = ex_{str,0-6} + ex_{R,Q} \)  

\( ex_{R,Q} = \left( 1 - T_0 / T \right) \cdot \dot{Q} \)  

\( \dot{Q} = 11.985 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

\( \dot{m}_{in} + \dot{m}_{out} = 6.233 \, \dot{m} \)  

\( \dot{m}_{in} = 5.203 \)  

\( \dot{m}_{out} = 5.203 \, \dot{m} \)  

\( \dot{m}_{in} = q \left( \dot{m}_{out} \right) \)

Exergy loss equals mass flow rate multiplied by exergy at state zero minus zero plus mass flow rate multiplied by heat at state B.  

Exergy loss equals exergy at state zero minus six plus delta B divided by six thousand two hundred eighty-three.  

Equals negative one hundred sixteen point six multiplied by four plus one thousand eighty-five divided by six thousand two hundred eighty-three.  

Equals seventy-three point three kilojoules per kilogram.  

This is the exergy loss.
