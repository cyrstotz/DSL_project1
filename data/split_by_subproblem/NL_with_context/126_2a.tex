A diagram is drawn representing a T-s diagram. The diagram includes labeled points and lines:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 connected to point 2 with a vertical line.  
- Point 2 connected to point 3 with a horizontal line labeled \( p_{2,3} \).  
- Point 3 connected to point 4 with a downward sloping line.  
- Point 4 connected to point 5 with a horizontal line labeled \( p_{45} \).  
- Point 5 connected to point 6 with a downward sloping line.  
- Point 6 connected back to point 0 with a curved line labeled \( p_0 \).  
The axes are labeled:  
- The vertical axis is \( T \) (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is \( s \) (entropy).
