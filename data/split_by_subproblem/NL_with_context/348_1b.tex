Thermodynamic mean temperature T_KF:  
T_KF equals integral of Q dot divided by T_ds from s_a to s_e equals Q dot divided by (s_a minus s_e).  

Since the process occurs in the cooling jacket:  
Delta s equals delta h divided by T_KF.  

For ideal liquid flow:  
Delta h equals c_p times (T_out minus T_in).  
Delta s equals c_p times ln(T_out divided by T_in).  

T_KF equals 293.12 Kelvin.
