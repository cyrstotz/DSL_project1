A diagram is drawn representing a T-s diagram with labeled isobars. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- Horizontal axis: 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]'  
- Vertical axis: 'T [K]'  

The diagram includes the following points and annotations:  
- Point 0: \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \), \( T_0 = -30^\circ \text{C} \)  
- Point 5: \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are connected to represent the process qualitatively.
