Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with multiple curves. The axes are labeled with 'p' for pressure and 'T' for temperature. The curves represent different phase regions.  
2. The second diagram is another p-T graph with labeled regions: 'fest' (solid), 'fl√ºssig' (liquid), and 'Gas' (gas). A sublimation point is marked, and the transition between states is indicated with arrows.
