A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]".  

The graph includes several curves and points:  
- Point "1" is marked on the graph.  
- Point "2" is marked higher up along a curve.  
- Point "3" is marked further along the curve.  
- Point "4" is marked on a separate curve.  

Two isobars are labeled:  
- "0.5 bar" near point 4.  
- "0.191 bar" near point 1.  

Another label "0.16" appears near point 1.  

The graph represents thermodynamic processes with curves connecting the points.

A diagram is drawn representing a T-s diagram with labeled points and curves. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  

The diagram includes the following labeled points:  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked on the diagram.  
- Curves and lines connect these points, representing processes in the jet engine.  
- The pressure at one point is noted as "0.191 bar."  

Below the diagram, the following text is written:  
=> "Main isobar lies on this side in the graph."  
=> "Pressure lies on the other side."
