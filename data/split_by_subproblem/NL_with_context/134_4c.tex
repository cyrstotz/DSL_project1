A graph is drawn with axes labeled "p" and "T". The graph shows a curve starting at point 1, moving upward to point 2, and then curving downward to point 3.  

The text reads:  
"m dot times (h2 minus h3) plus Q dot minus W dot equals 0.  
h2 (x equals 1) implies hg.  
h3 (8 bar) equals hg (8 bar from table).  
Ti equals 16 Kelvin above sublimation temperature.  
p equals 5 mbar under triple point equals 0 degrees Celsius."

x1, T2 → isentropic adiabatic throttling → isentropic to 8 bar.  
s1 = s2 → x1 = s1 minus sf divided by sfg minus sf.  

s1 (8 bar, x1 = 0) = sf plus x1 times sfg (8 bar) = 0.3459.  
- T = 31.33°C
