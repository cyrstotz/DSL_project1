A diagram is drawn with labeled axes: entropy (S) on the x-axis and temperature (T) on the y-axis. The diagram shows a qualitative T-s process with labeled points:  
- Point 1: isentropic  
- Point 2: isobaric  
- Point 3: isobaric  
- Point 4: isentropic  
- Point 5: isobaric  
- Point 6: isentropic  
The process lines connect the points in sequence, forming a cycle.

U subscript F e W 2 equals open parenthesis negative 333.82 plus 333.498 close parenthesis divided by open parenthesis 2.9 minus 2 close parenthesis.  

333.498 equals 333.533 kilojoules per kilogram.
