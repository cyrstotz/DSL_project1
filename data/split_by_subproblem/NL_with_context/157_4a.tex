Two diagrams are drawn.  

The first diagram is labeled with "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). It shows phase regions with lines connecting points labeled "1", "2", and "3". The axes are labeled "P" (pressure) and "T" (temperature).  

The second diagram is simpler, showing phase regions labeled "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). It includes points labeled "1", "2", and "3" connected by lines. The axes are labeled "P" (pressure) and "T" (temperature).
