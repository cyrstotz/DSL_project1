A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as \( p \, [\text{bar}] \) and the x-axis labeled as \( T \, [^\circ \text{C}] \).  
The graph shows three distinct regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "gas."  
An isobar is marked, and a point labeled "2" is indicated along the isobar in the "gas" region.
