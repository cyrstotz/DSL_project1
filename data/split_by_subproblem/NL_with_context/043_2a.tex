A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as \( T \) [K].  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as \( S \) [kJ/kgÂ·K].  

The diagram includes the following:  
- Points labeled as 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.  
- Isobaric lines labeled as "isobar" for points 1 to 2 and 5 to 6.  
- Adiabatic lines labeled as "adiabat" for points 2 to 3 and 6 to 1.  
- A mixing process labeled as "MM" between points 3 and 5.  
- The pressure relationship \( p_3 = p_1 \) is indicated.  
- The pressure relationship \( p_0 = p_6 \) is indicated.
