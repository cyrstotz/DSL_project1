A equals (D divided by 2) squared times pi equals 0.00785 square meters.  
pK equals mK divided by A equals 39990 pascals equals 33.99 kilopascals.  
pEW approximately equals 0.6108 kilopascals (from Table A-6).  
pG plus pEW equals pK plus pAmb.  
Therefore, pG equals pK plus pAmb minus pEW equals 1.394 bar.
