\( c_p = R + c_v = 799.28 \, \text{J/kgÂ·K} \)  

\( c_p \cdot m_g \cdot T_{g,1} + 0.6 \cdot m_{EW} \)  

\( \frac{c_p}{c_v} = n = 1.26 \)  

Pressure remains constant from state 1 to state 2:  
\( p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \)  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) of the gas will be slightly above \( 0^\circ \text{C} \), as ice is still present and the ice-water mixture has a temperature of approximately \( 0^\circ \text{C} \).
