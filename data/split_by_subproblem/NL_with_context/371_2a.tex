A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 'S [kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin]' and the y-axis labeled as 'T [Kelvin]'. The graph shows a curve with several labeled points:  
- Point 2 is at the lower left.  
- Point 4 is at the peak of the curve.  
- Point 5 is on the descending part of the curve, higher than point 4.  
- Point 6 is on the right side of the graph, connected by a line extending upward.
