A diagram is drawn showing a p-T graph with labeled points. The graph includes the following:  
- A curve labeled "R134a" representing the phase boundary between liquid and gas.  
- Points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4" along the curve and axes.  
- The temperature axis is labeled "T (-10Â°C)".  
- The pressure axis is labeled "p (mbar)".  
- The region is divided into "liquid" and "gas".
