A diagram is drawn with the title "Aufgabe 2". The graph is labeled with axes: the vertical axis is labeled "T [K]" and the horizontal axis is labeled "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The diagram shows a process with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 connected by curves and lines. The points are arranged to represent thermodynamic processes, with arrows indicating the direction of the process. The labels "p0", "p2", and "p5" are written near the respective points.
