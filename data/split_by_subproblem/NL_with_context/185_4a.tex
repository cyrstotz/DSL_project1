Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram shows a pressure (P) versus temperature (T) graph with labeled regions and curves. There is a looped path with arrows indicating transitions between states.  
2. The second diagram shows a pressure (P) versus enthalpy (h) graph with labeled points and arrows. The states are marked as 1, 2, and 3, with transitions such as "dp" and "isobar."

Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled with axes \( p \) (pressure) and \( h \) (enthalpy). It shows curves labeled "isochor" and "isobar" with points marked as \( 1 \), \( 2 \), and \( A \). The temperature levels \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are indicated.  

2. The second diagram is labeled with axes \( T \) (temperature) and \( p \) (pressure). It shows curves labeled "isochor" and "isobar" with points marked as \( 1 \), \( 2 \), and \( A \).
