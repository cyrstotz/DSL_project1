Diagram:  
A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled phase regions and processes:  
- Isobaric process from state 1 to state 2.  
- Isentropic process from state 2 to state 3.  
- Isobaric process from state 3 to state 4.  
- Isentropic and isothermal process from state 4 to state 1.  

Tp = Ti - 6K = T2  
Tp = 10K + Ttriple  
= 10 Kelvin + 273.15  
= 283.15 Kelvin  

T2 = Ti - 6 Kelvin = 277.15 Kelvin
