A diagram is drawn with the temperature (T) on the vertical axis and entropy (s) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows labeled isobars and isentropic lines connecting various states:  
- State 0 to State 2 is labeled as "isentrop."  
- State 2 to State 3 is labeled as "isobar."  
- State 3 to State 4 is labeled as "isobar."  
- State 4 to State 5 is labeled as "isentrop."  
- State 5 to State 6 is labeled as "isentrop."  
The pressure values are marked:  
- \( p_0 = p_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \).  
- \( p_4 > p_0 \).  
- \( p_r = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).
