Thermodynamic mean temperature T KF:  
T KF equals integral of T ds divided by integral of ds.  
Isobaric process implies T KF equals (h out minus h in) divided by (s out minus s in).  
Ideal liquid:  
T KF equals integral from T1 to T2 of c p divided by c p times dT divided by integral from T1 to T2 of dT.  
T KF equals (T2 minus T1) divided by ln(T2 divided by T1).  
T KF equals 293.12 Kelvin.
