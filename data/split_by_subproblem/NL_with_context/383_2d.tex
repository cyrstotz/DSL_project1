Mass-specific exergy loss equals mass-specific exergy flow rate times T0 times entropy production rate.  

Entropy balance: Zero equals mass flow rate times s0 minus mass flow rate times s6 plus heat flow rate divided by T0 plus entropy production rate.  

Entropy production rate equals mass flow rate times s6 divided by mass-specific exergy flow rate minus s0.  

Mass flow balance at the mixing chamber: mass flow rate times (h0 minus hNS) equals mass flow rate times (h0 minus hN).  

Efficiency of the mixing chamber equals h0 minus hNS divided by h0 minus hN, which equals mass-specific exergy flow rate divided by mass flow rate.
