A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kg·K) and the y-axis labeled as temperature (T) in degrees Celsius (°C). The graph includes several curves representing isobars, with points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The following annotations are included:  
- \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( p_3, p_1 \)  
- \( p_4, p_5 \)  
The isobars are labeled as follows:  
- 1 → 2: Adiabatic compression with \( \eta_{V,s} < 1 \)  
- 2 → 3: Adiabatic pre-compression  
- 3 → 4: Isobaric heat addition  
- 4 → 5: Mixing  
- 5 → 6: Adiabatic nozzle expansion at \( p_0 \)
