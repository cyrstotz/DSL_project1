Exergy loss equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 0 minus the surrounding temperature multiplied by the difference between entropy at state 6 and entropy at state 0.  

Exergy loss equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 0 minus the surrounding temperature multiplied by the difference between entropy at state 6 and entropy at state 0 plus one-half multiplied by the difference between velocity squared at state 6 and velocity squared at state 0 plus the summation of one minus the surrounding temperature divided by the thermodynamic mean temperature multiplied by heat flow minus work flow.  

Delta c sub x, s k equals one hundred kilojoules per kilogram.  

i sub ex, q equals one minus the surrounding temperature divided by the thermodynamic mean temperature multiplied by q sub B equals one minus 293 Kelvin divided by 1289 Kelvin multiplied by 1195 kilojoules per kilogram equals 869.72 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Entropy production equals entropy at state 0 minus entropy at state 6 plus q sub B divided by thermodynamic mean temperature minus work flow divided by thermodynamic mean temperature.  

Entropy production equals entropy at state 5 minus entropy at state 0 plus the integral from surrounding temperature to thermodynamic mean temperature of c sub p divided by thermodynamic mean temperature multiplied by temperature dT minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at state 5.  

R equals gas constant divided by molar mass of air equals 28.97 kilograms per kilomole.  

Exergy loss equals surrounding temperature multiplied by c sub p multiplied by the natural logarithm of thermodynamic mean temperature divided by surrounding temperature minus R divided by molar mass multiplied by the natural logarithm of pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at state 0 minus velocity at state 0 divided by thermodynamic mean temperature.
