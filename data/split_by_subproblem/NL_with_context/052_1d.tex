Half-open system:  
Delta E equals delta m times h two plus Q R twelve plus Q out twelve.  

m total two minus m total one equals delta m twelve.  

Therefore, delta m twelve equals m total two minus m total one divided by h twelve.  

h two equals u two plus p times v two.  

u one equals u f at one hundred degrees Celsius plus x D times (u g minus u f), equals 429.378 kilojoules per kilogram.  

u two equals u f at seventy degrees Celsius plus x zero times (u g minus u f), equals 303.368 kilojoules per kilogram.  

h twelve equals h one minus h two, equals 126.06 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Therefore, delta m twelve equals (m total two times h twelve minus m total one times h twelve) divided by h twelve.  

Delta m twelve plus m total two divided by h twelve equals m total two minus m total one divided by h twelve times (one plus one divided by h twelve).  

Delta m twelve equals m total two minus m total one divided by h twelve times (one plus one divided by h twelve), equals 5680 kilograms.
