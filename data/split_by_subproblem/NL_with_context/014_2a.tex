A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points:  
- \( T \) [°C] on the vertical axis and \( s \) [kJ/kg·K] on the horizontal axis.  
- Points labeled as \( 0 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \).  
- Dashed lines represent isobars, including \( p_0 \) and \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
- The diagram shows the process qualitatively with arrows indicating transitions between states.
