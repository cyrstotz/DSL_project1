A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and process states.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]' (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]' (specific entropy).  
- Points are marked as follows:  
  - Point 0 at the bottom left.  
  - Point 1 above point 0.  
  - Point 2 above point 1, with a dashed line labeled \( P_A \).  
  - Point 3 to the right of point 2, with a dashed line labeled \( P_2 = P_3 \).  
  - Point 4 above point 3.  
  - Point 5 to the right of point 4, with a dashed line labeled \( P_1 = P_5 \).  
  - Point 6 below point 5, with a dashed line labeled \( P_0 = P_6 \).  
- Curved lines connect the points, representing the thermodynamic processes.
