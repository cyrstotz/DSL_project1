Delta E divided by m sub g equals

Exergy increase in flow, \( ex_{str} \), is given as:  
\[ ex_{str} = [h - h_0 - T_0 (s - s_0) + w squared divided by 2] \]  

For state 6:  
\[ ex_{str,6} = [h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + w_6 squared divided by 2] \]  

For state 0:  
\[ ex_{str,0} = [h_0 - h_0 - T_0 (s_0 - s_0) + w_0 squared divided by 2] \]  

This simplifies to:  
\[ w_0 squared divided by 2 = 20,000 meters squared per second squared \]
