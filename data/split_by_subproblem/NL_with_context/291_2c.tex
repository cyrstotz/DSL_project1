Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream six minus exergy stream zero.  
Delta exergy stream equals [enthalpy six minus enthalpy zero minus temperature zero times (entropy six minus entropy zero) plus delta kinetic energy plus delta potential energy].  
Equals enthalpy six minus enthalpy zero minus temperature zero times (entropy six minus entropy zero) plus velocity six squared minus velocity zero squared divided by two.  

Equals specific heat times (temperature six minus temperature zero) minus temperature zero times [specific heat times logarithm (temperature six divided by temperature zero) minus gas constant times logarithm (pressure six divided by pressure zero)] plus velocity six squared minus velocity zero squared divided by two.  

Pressure zero equals pressure zero given value.  

Delta exergy stream equals negative 2601.94 kilojoules per kilogram.
