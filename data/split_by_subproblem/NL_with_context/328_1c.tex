Entropy balance:  
Closed system, adiabatic.  

Delta S equals sum of S plus S-dot erz.  

Delta S equals sum of Q divided by T plus S-dot erz.  

Q-dot aus divided by T equals Q-dot aus times (1 divided by TR minus 1 divided by T).  

S-dot erz equals minus Q-dot aus times (1 divided by TR minus 1 divided by T).  

Equals minus 62 kilowatts times (1 divided by 373.15 Kelvin minus 1 divided by 293.15 Kelvin).  

Equals approximately 0.04615 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Equals approximately 46.15 joules per kilogram.
