A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph shows several curves labeled as "isobar @ p_5 = 0.5 bar" and "isobar @ p_0 = 0.797 bar". Points are marked and connected with lines, labeled as 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The lines represent transitions between states, with arrows indicating the direction of the processes.
