The title reads: "Energiebilanz stat. Flie√üprozess."  

An equation is written:  
T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  
This leads to T6 equals T5 multiplied by (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

Substituting values:  
T6 equals (431.9 K) multiplied by (0.191 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (0.4 divided by 1.4).  

The result is calculated as:  
T6 equals 328.07 K.

\( (h_6 - h_5) \cdot 2 = w_6^2 - w_5^2 \)  
\( w_6^2 = w_5^2 - 2 \cdot (h_6 - h_5) \)  
\( w_6 = \sqrt{w_5^2 - 2 \cdot c_p \cdot (T_6 - T_5)} \)  
\( = \sqrt{220^2 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 - 2 \cdot 1.006 \, \text{kJ}/\text{kgK} \cdot (328.07 \, \text{K} - 431.9 \, \text{K})} \)  
\( = 507.25 \, \text{m/s} \)
