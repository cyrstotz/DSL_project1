Partial derivative of exergy with respect to time equals the sum of exergy flow rates minus the sum of work terms minus the sum of heat terms divided by ambient temperature minus exergy loss.  

Zero equals the change in flow exergy minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals the change in flow exergy minus the change in flow exergy divided by mass flow rate.  

Exergy loss equals negative sixteen point two five four kilojoules.
