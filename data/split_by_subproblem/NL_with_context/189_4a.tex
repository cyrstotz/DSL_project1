A graph is drawn with axes labeled as `p` (pressure) on the vertical axis and `T` (temperature) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes three points labeled `1`, `2`, and `3`.  
- Point `1` is at the top right.  
- Point `2` is directly below point `1`.  
- Point `3` is to the left of point `2`.  
- A horizontal line connects points `1` and `2`.  
- A vertical line connects points `2` and `3`.  
- The graph includes labels for `p_triple` and `p_sublimation = 5 mbar`.

Directly adiabatic → u four equals u one  
Isobaric condensation → p four equals p three equals eight bar  

Thus → u four equals u three equals u g (specific) equals 0.0255 kilojoules per kilogram
