A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the vertical axis and entropy (S) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled regions and processes:  
- "isobare Wärmezufuhr" (isobaric heat addition)  
- "adiabatisch reversibel Verdichter" (adiabatic reversible compressor)  
- "adiabatisch irreversibel Turbine" (adiabatic irreversible turbine)  
- "adiabatisch reversibel Schubdüse" (adiabatic reversible nozzle)  
- "adiabatisch Verdichter mit η < 1" (adiabatic compressor with efficiency less than 1)  

Points labeled "1", "2", and "5" are marked on the graph, along with a pressure label "p6 = p0".
