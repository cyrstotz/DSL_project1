X ice equals m ice divided by m EW.  

m EW equals zero point one kilograms.  
T EW equals zero degrees Celsius.  
P outside equals one point four bar.  

P piston equals P ambient plus F divided by A.  

F equals m piston times g.  
A equals r squared times pi equals zero point zero five meters squared times pi equals seven point eight five four times ten to the power of negative three square meters.  

P EW equals one thousand pascals plus F divided by A equals three nine eight nine three point four four pascals equals one point three nine eight nine three four four bar.  

Delta equals four point three minus one point four bar equals P outside.  

h two equals h f plus X times (h liquid minus h f).  

V two equals V f plus X times (V solid minus V f).
