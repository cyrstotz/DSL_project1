Delta exergy flow equals exergy flow at state 6 minus exergy flow at state 0.  
Delta exergy flow equals h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0) plus Delta ke.  

cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0)  
cp multiplied by ln (T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by ln (p6 divided by p0).  

85.43 kilojoules per kilogram equals c.  
73.28 kilojoules per kilogram equals T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0).  

Delta ke equals w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2.  
w6 equals 220 meters per second.  
w0 equals 200 meters per second.  
Delta ke equals 217.297 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy flow equals 229.455 kilojoules per kilogram.
