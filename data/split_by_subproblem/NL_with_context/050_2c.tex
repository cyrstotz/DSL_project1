A second T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and processes.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled 's' (entropy).  
- The vertical axis is labeled 'T' (temperature).  
- Points are marked as 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Point 5 is labeled '0.5 bar'.  
- Point 6 is labeled '0.191 bar'.  
- Processes are annotated with arrows and 'm dot K' and 'm dot M'.

Delta e exergy equals e exergy six minus e exergy zero equals h zero minus h six minus T zero multiplied by (s six minus s zero) plus (w six squared minus w zero squared divided by two).  

Equals cp multiplied by (T zero minus T six minus T zero multiplied by ln(T six divided by T zero)) plus (w six squared minus w zero squared divided by two).  

Equals cp multiplied by (340 kelvin minus 243.15 kelvin minus 243.15 kelvin multiplied by ln(340 kelvin divided by 243.15 kelvin)) plus (240 squared minus 200 squared divided by two).  

Equals 25.5 kilojoules per kilogram.
