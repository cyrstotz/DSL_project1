The diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
- The x-axis is labeled as 'T [°C]', ranging from -70 to 20.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'p [mbar]', ranging from 0.1 to 100.  
- A curve is drawn representing the sublimation point.  
- Two labeled regions are visible:  
  - Above the curve: 'flüssig' (liquid).  
  - Below the curve: 'flüssig-gasförmig' (liquid-gaseous).  
- Two steps are marked:  
  - Step i: A horizontal line above the sublimation curve.  
  - Step ii: A vertical line below the sublimation curve.
