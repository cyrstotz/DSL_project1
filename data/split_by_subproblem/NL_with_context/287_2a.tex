A graph is drawn with the axes labeled as \( T \) (temperature) and \( s \) (specific entropy). The graph shows a qualitative T-s diagram with five points labeled as 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 with a curve labeled "isentrop."  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 with a curve labeled "isobar."  
- Point 3 is connected to point 5 with a curve labeled "isobar (0.5 bar)."  
- Point 5 is connected to point 6 with a curve labeled "isobar (0.191 bar)."
