Zero equals S dot erz plus Q out divided by T KF minus Q out divided by T Reactor 1.  
S dot erz equals Q out multiplied by (1 divided by T Reactor 1 minus 1 divided by T KF) equals negative 46.9463 kilowatts per Kelvin.  

Q out equals 65 kilowatts.  
T KF equals 295 Kelvin.  
T Reactor 1 equals 373.15 Kelvin.
