h2 equals 237.74  
h3 equals 271.3  

2 → 3 First Law of Thermodynamics  
0 equals m dot times (h2 minus h3) plus Q dot minus W dot  
W dot divided by (h2 minus h3) equals m dot  

adiabatic  
W dot equals negative 28 kilowatts  

m dot equals 0.834 grams per second

A diagram is drawn with temperature (T in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and entropy (S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows several labeled points connected by lines:  

- Point 0 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 is connected to Point 0 with a vertical line labeled "η < 1".  
- Point 2 is connected to Point 1 with a diagonal line labeled "isentrop".  
- Point 3 is connected to Point 2 with a diagonal line labeled "η < 1".  
- Point 4 is connected to Point 3 with a horizontal line labeled "isobar".  
- Point 5 is connected to Point 4 with a diagonal line labeled "isentrop".  
- Point 6 is connected to Point 5 with a diagonal line labeled "η < 1".  

The diagram includes three isobars labeled:  
- "p0" at the bottom.  
- "p1" in the middle.  
- "pc (hochdruckseite >> p0)" at the top.  

Below the diagram, the following notes are written:  
- z0: 0.191 bar, -30 degrees Celsius  
- z1: p1 (η adiabatic η < 1)  
- z2: isentrop, p2  
- z3: isobar  
- p4 = p1 = p5
