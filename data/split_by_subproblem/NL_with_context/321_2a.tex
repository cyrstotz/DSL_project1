A diagram is drawn with the title "T-s Diagram." The x-axis is labeled as "S in kJ/kgÂ·K," and the y-axis is labeled as "T in K." The diagram shows a series of points labeled as follows:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 leading upward to Point 2.  
- Point 2 leading upward to Point 3.  
- Point 3 leading downward to Point 5.  
- Point 5 leading downward to Point 6.  
- Point 6 leading downward to Point 0.  
The points are connected by curves and straight lines, representing processes. The isobars are labeled as \( P_0 \), \( P_3 \), and \( P_5 \).
