The equation is written as:  
h2 equals hL plus x multiplied by (hG minus hL), which equals hG.  

Below, the equation is expanded:  
hG equals hL (8 bar) equals 93.62 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table A-12).  

The vapor quality x is calculated as:  
x equals h2 minus hL divided by hG minus hL.  

Final expression:  
x equals hG minus hL divided by hG minus hL.  

A note is added:  
"Wert für hL(flüssig) & hG(gas) finden & einsetzen" (Find and substitute the values for hL (liquid) and hG (gas)).
