A table is provided with columns labeled as P, V, h, x, and S.  
- Row 1: P = 1, V = blank, h = blank, x = 1, S = 0.9294  
- Row 2: P = 2, V = blank, h = blank, x = 1, S = 0.9298  
- Row 3: P = 8, V = blank, h = blank, x = 1, S = 0.9298  
- Row 4: P = 8, V = blank, h = blank, x = 0, S = blank  

Additional notes:  
- Ti = -70°C, T2 = -76°C  
- h2 = 237.74  
- S2 = 0.9298  

Equations and calculations:  
- m multiplied by delta h equals W dot 23 (m [Δh] = Ẇ23).  
- m equals W divided by h3 minus h2 (m = W / (h3 - h2)).  
- ṁ equals W divided by h3 minus h2 equals 28 W divided by (2771.21 - 237.74) equals 0.008634 kilograms per second (ṁ = W / (h3 - h2) = 28 W / (2771.21 - 237.74) = 0.008634 kg/s).  
- ṁ multiplied by 3600 equals 3.0 kilograms per hour (ṁ × 3600 = 3.0 kg/h).  

Additional notes and equations:  
- T3 equals 37.86°C (T3 = 37.86°C).  
- h3 equals 2773.7 (h3 = 2773.7).  
- x equals temperature, y equals h (x = temp, y = h).  
- At T_sat: 1) at T_sat, 2) at 40°C.
