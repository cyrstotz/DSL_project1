A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "T in °C" (temperature in degrees Celsius).  
- The vertical axis is labeled "p in bar" (pressure in bar).  

The diagram includes three regions:  
1. "Fest" (solid) at the top-left corner.  
2. "Flüssig" (liquid) in the middle.  
3. "Gasförmig" (gaseous) at the bottom-right corner.  

A line labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point) separates the solid, liquid, and gaseous regions.  
Another line labeled "Isolante Friende Wasserstoff" (possibly indicating an isolating boundary for hydrogen or water) is drawn near the solid region.
