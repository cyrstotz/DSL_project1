A graph is shown with the title "T [K]" on the vertical axis and "s [W/kgÂ·K]" on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points and curves:  
- Point 0 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2, which is connected to point 3.  
- Point 4 is connected to point 5, which is connected to point 6.  
- The curves are labeled with pressure values:  
  - \( p_2 = p_3 \)  
  - \( p_1 = p_4 = p_5 \)  
  - \( p_0 = p_6 \)
