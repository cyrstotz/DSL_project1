- Isentropic relationships are described:  
  TG / TS = (pG / pS) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.  
  TG = pS multiplied by TS multiplied by (pG / pS) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.  
  TG = 431.9 Kelvin multiplied by (0.191 / 0.5) raised to the power of (0.4 / 1.4).  
  TG = 328.97 Kelvin.  

- Energy balance equation:  
  dE/dt = m multiplied by (hS plus wS squared divided by 2 minus hG minus wG squared divided by 2) plus summation of Q dot minus summation of W dot.  
  wG = square root of (hS plus wS squared divided by 2 minus hG) multiplied by 2.  
  hS minus hG = cp multiplied by (TS minus TG).  
  wG = square root of (2 multiplied by cp multiplied by (TS minus TG) plus wS squared divided by 2).  
  wG = 257.3 meters per second.  
  wG = 487.3 meters per second.
