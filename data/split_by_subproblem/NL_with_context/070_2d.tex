Exergy loss equals T zero multiplied by entropy production.  

Stationary flow process:  
Zero equals m dot multiplied by (s zero minus s six) plus Q divided by T six plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals s six minus s zero minus q divided by T six equals 0.927905 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 1195 divided by 1289 equals 0.505 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Exergy loss equals T zero multiplied by entropy production equals 243.15 multiplied by 0.505 equals 122.832 kilowatts per kilogram.
