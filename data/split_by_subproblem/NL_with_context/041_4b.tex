The process from state 2 to state 3 is described as 'isotrop' (isentropic) and 'adiabar' (adiabatic).  
The energy balance equation is written as:  
dT = m dot times [hi] plus summation of W dot equals summation of W dot.  
This is followed by the statement: "weil Arbeit am System verrichtet wird" (because work is performed on the system).  

The mass flow rate of R134a is calculated using:  
m dot R134a equals W dot K divided by (h2 minus h3).  

Additional equations and notes:  
- h2 equals hg(T2).  
- T2 equals ?.  
- h3 equals hf(8 bar) plus x times (hg(8 bar) minus hf(8 bar)); x equals ?.  
- Isentropic implies s2 equals s3.  
- s2 equals sg(T2).
