EW → incompressible  

pg1 = pamb + (32 × g) divided by (π × r squared)  
r = 0.05  

32 × g = 9.80665 joules per meter squared  
Table first page  

pamb + (32 × 9.80665) divided by (π × (0.05) squared) = 1.398 bar → 1.43 bar = pg1  

mg = perfect gas → (p × V0) divided by (R × Tg) = mg  

(1.4 × 10^5 × 0.00314 cubic meters) divided by (834 × 773.15 kelvin) = 0.00341943 kilograms = 3.42 grams = mg1
