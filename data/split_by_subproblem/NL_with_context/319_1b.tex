T_KF bar equals the integral of T ds divided by (s_a minus s_e) equals q_rev divided by (s_a minus s_e).  

q_rev equals (h_KF,in plus h_KF,out) divided by (s_a minus s_e).  

From the Stoffmodel:  
T_2 equals T_KF,aus, and T_1 equals T_KF,ein.  

T_KF bar equals (T_2 minus T_1) divided by ln(T_2 divided by T_1).  

T_KF bar equals (T_2 minus T_1) divided by ln(T_2 divided by T_1) equals 293.722 Kelvin.
