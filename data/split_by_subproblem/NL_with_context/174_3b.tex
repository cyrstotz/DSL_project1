\( p_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,1} \)  

\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \)  

The equation from subtask a) still applies:  
\( p_{g,1} A = m_K g + m_{EW} g + p_{amb} A \)  

\( p_{g,2} = 1.401 \, \text{bar} \)  

\( T_{g,2} = T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ \, \text{C} \)  

\( x_{\text{Ice},2} > 0 \), meaning the temperature of the EW mixture has not yet risen.
