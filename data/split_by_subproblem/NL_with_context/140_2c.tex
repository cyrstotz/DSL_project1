Delta exergy equals exergy at state six minus exergy at state zero.  

Mass flow rate times (enthalpy at state six minus enthalpy at state zero minus temperature at state zero times (entropy at state six minus entropy at state zero)) plus pressure at state zero times (velocity at state six squared minus velocity at state zero squared).  

Delta exergy equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy at state six minus enthalpy at state zero minus temperature at state zero times (entropy at state six minus entropy at state zero)) plus pressure at state zero times (velocity at state six squared minus velocity at state zero squared).  

Enthalpy at state six minus enthalpy at state zero equals specific heat capacity times (temperature at state six minus temperature at state zero).  

Entropy at state six minus entropy at state zero equals specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of (temperature at state six divided by temperature at state zero).  

Delta exergy equals mass flow rate times (specific heat capacity times (temperature at state six minus temperature at state zero) minus temperature at state zero times (specific heat capacity times the natural logarithm of (temperature at state six divided by temperature at state zero))) plus pressure at state zero times (velocity at state six squared minus velocity at state zero squared).
