x equals u minus u sub f divided by u sub g minus u sub f.  

Since the membrane transfers heat:  
T sub g,2 equals T sub EW,2 equals 0.003 degrees Celsius.  

Delta E equals negative Q sub 12.  
Delta E divided by m sub EW equals u equals negative 15 a sub 2 divided by a sub g.  

Therefore:  
x equals T sub g to the power of 4 minus (negative 0.077) divided by negative 233.442 plus 0.023 equals 0.0449.
