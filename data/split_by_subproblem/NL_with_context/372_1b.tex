Thermodynamic mean temperature T bar equals integral from Ta to Te of T ds divided by integral from sa to se of ds.  

T KF mean equals 25 degrees Celsius.  
T KF inlet equals 15 degrees Celsius.  

Entropy difference:  
sa minus se equals integral from Ta to Te of c KF divided by T dT equals c KF times ln of (T KF outlet divided by T KF inlet).
