Force equilibrium in state 1 at the membrane:  
p_g1 multiplied by A equals p_amb multiplied by A plus (m_K plus m_EW) multiplied by g.  
p_g1 equals 10 to the power of 5 plus (32 plus 0.1) multiplied by 9.81 divided by 0.12 multiplied by pi divided by 4.  
Equals 1.401 bar.  

Ideal gas implies p_g1 multiplied by V_g1 equals m_g multiplied by R multiplied by T_g1.  
R equals R divided by N_g equals 8.314 divided by 50 equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
m_g equals 1.401 multiplied by 10 to the power of 5 multiplied by 3.14 multiplied by 10 to the power of negative 3 divided by 166.28 multiplied by 773.15.  
Equals 3.422 grams.
