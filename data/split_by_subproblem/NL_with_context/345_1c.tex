Sum T divided by S equals s2 minus s1.  
s2 minus s1 equals ln multiplied by h2 minus h1.  
Sum T divided by S equals c multiplied by ln multiplied by T2 divided by T1.  
Sum T divided by S equals c multiplied by (T2 minus T1).  
S production equals (s2 minus s1) minus Q divided by T.  
S production equals 0.95709 kilojoules per Kelvin.  
TAB A2:  
S production equals 13.000 kilograms multiplied by Kelvin.  
S production equals 0.378 kilojoules per Kelvin.
