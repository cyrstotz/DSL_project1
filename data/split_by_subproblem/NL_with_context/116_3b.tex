The pressure remains constant because external pressure and mass of EW/piston remain equal:  
\( p_2 = p_1 = 1.40094 \, \text{bar} \)  

Mass of the gas, pressure, and gas constant remain constant, but volume changes, so temperature also changes.  

\( x_{\text{Ice},2} > 0 \)  
\( T_{\text{g,2}} = 0 \)
