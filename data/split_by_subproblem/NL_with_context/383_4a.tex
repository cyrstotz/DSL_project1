A table is presented with the following columns and values:  
- Zustand (State): 1, 2, 3, 4  
- T [K]: Blank for state 1 and state 4, "not needed" for state 2, and "8" for state 3.  
- p [bar]: \( p_1 = p_2 \), \( p_2 = p_1 \), \( p_3 = 8 \), \( p_4 = p_3 \).  
- x [ ]: 1 for state 2, 0 for state 4.  

Below the table, a diagram is drawn with the axes labeled:  
- Vertical axis: \( p \) [bar]  
- Horizontal axis: \( T \) [K]  

The diagram shows a closed cycle with four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The cycle progresses as follows:  
- From state 1 to state 2 (horizontal line).  
- From state 2 to state 3 (upward curve).  
- From state 3 to state 4 (horizontal line).  
- From state 4 back to state 1 (downward curve).
