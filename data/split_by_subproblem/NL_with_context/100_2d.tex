Exergy equals T zero times s exergy.  

s exergy equals m dot times (s two minus s one) minus q divided by T j.  

s exergy equals m dot times (s six minus s zero) minus q divided by T j.  

s exergy equals m dot times cp times (T two minus T one) minus... (crossed out section).  

m zero equals m dot times (m dot plus 5.293).  

m zero equals m dot times (m dot divided by 5.293).  

m zero equals m dot times (1 plus 5.293 m dot).
