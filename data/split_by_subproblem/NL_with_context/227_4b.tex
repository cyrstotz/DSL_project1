The equation is written as:  
dQ/dt equals the sum of mass flow rates multiplied by enthalpy (h_i) plus heat flow (Q dot) minus work (W dot).  

Further derivation:  
Q equals mass flow rate (m dot) multiplied by the difference in enthalpy (h_e minus h_a) plus heat flow (Q dot) minus work (W dot).  

The mass flow rate (m dot) is calculated as:  
m dot equals W dot minus Q dot divided by (h_e minus h_a).  

A table is provided:  
1 | p | T | x  
---|---|---|---  
1 | 0 | 0 | 0  
2 | 1 | 1 | 1  
3 | 8 bar | 1 | 1  
4 | 8 bar | 0 | 0  

Additional notes:  
"Wärmeübertrager" (heat exchanger) is written.  

Equation:  
1 to 2: m dot multiplied by (h_e minus h_a) plus Q dot equals zero, leading to Q dot equals m dot multiplied by (h_a minus h_e).  

Annotations:  
- W dot equals 28 W.  
- Q dot equals ?  
- Q_ab equals ?
