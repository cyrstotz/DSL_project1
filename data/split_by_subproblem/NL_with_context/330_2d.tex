Energy balance: SFP:  

Q equals delta ex_str plus ex_xQ minus ex_xverl  

ex_xverl equals p_ex_str plus ex_xQ  

n divided by n multiplied by (1 minus T_0 divided by T) multiplied by Q  

equals (1 minus T_0 divided by T_B) multiplied by q_B  

ex_xverl equals delta ex_str plus (1 minus T_0 divided by T_B) multiplied by q_B
