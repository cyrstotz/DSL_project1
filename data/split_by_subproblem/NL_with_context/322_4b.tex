Mass flow rate of the refrigerant:  

Energy balance for the compressor:  
Summation of mass flow rates multiplied by enthalpy and kinetic energy terms:  
Σ m_i (h_i plus one-half times w_i squared) equals Σ Q_i minus Σ W_i.  

The equation is simplified:  
m_dot equals mixture (h_2 minus h_3) minus W_dot.  

Mass flow rate equation:  
m_dot equals V_dot divided by (h_2 minus h_3).  

Additional notes:  
- h_2 is determined from p_3 (pressure at state 3).  
- T_i is crossed out.  
- h_4 is determined from h_f (at 8 bar) and equals 75.92 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Entropy balance:  
Reversible process implies s_2 equals s_3.  

Pressure relationships:  
p_2 equals p_1.  

Final energy balance:  
Q equals m_dot times (h_4 minus h_1).  

Additional notes:  
- h_4 minus h_1 is highlighted.
