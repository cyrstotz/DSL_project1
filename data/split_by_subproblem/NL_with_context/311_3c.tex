LHS in balance:  
m subscript EW multiplied by (U subscript 2EW minus U subscript 1EW) plus m subscript g multiplied by (U subscript 2g minus U subscript 1g) equals 0.  

m subscript EW equals 0.4 multiplied by m subscript EW.  

W subscript 12 gas equals integral of p subscript g dV equals integral from V subscript 1 to V subscript 2 of p subscript 0 plus (m subscript g multiplied by g divided by A) dV equals (p subscript 0 multiplied by (V subscript 2 minus V subscript 1)) plus (m subscript g multiplied by g divided by A) multiplied by (V subscript 2 minus V subscript 1).  

V subscript 2g equals m subscript g multiplied by R multiplied by T subscript 2g divided by p subscript 2g equals 0.001106 cubic meters.  

Q subscript 12 equals m subscript g multiplied by (U subscript 2g minus U subscript 1g) plus W subscript 12 equals C subscript V multiplied by (T subscript 2 minus T subscript 1) equals negative 233.586 kilojoules.  

C subscript V equals 8 multiplied by R minus C subscript p equals 0.46672 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin equals negative 233.168.
