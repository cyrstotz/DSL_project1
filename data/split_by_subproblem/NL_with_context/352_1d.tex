Energy balance:  
dE/dt equals the sum of inlet enthalpy flow rates minus the sum of outlet enthalpy flow rates plus heat flow rate minus work flow rate.  

Delta U equals mass change between states 1 and 2 times enthalpy at state 2 plus reaction heat minus heat flow rate out.  

Delta U equals mass change between states 1 and 2 times enthalpy at state 2.  

Mass change between states 1 and 2 equals Delta U divided by enthalpy at state 2 minus (mass at state 2 plus mass change between states 1 and 2 times enthalpy at state 2 minus mass at state 1 times enthalpy at state 1) divided by enthalpy at state 2.  

Mass change between states 1 and 2 equals mass at state 1 times enthalpy at state 2 minus mass at state 1 times enthalpy at state 1 divided by enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 1.  

Mass change between states 1 and 2 equals mass at state 1 times (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 1) divided by enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 1.

h2 = h1 (100 degrees Celsius, x = 0.005) = h1 (100 degrees Celsius) + x (hfg (100 degrees Celsius) - h1 (100 degrees Celsius))  
≈ 430.3 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table A-2)  

h2 = h (70 degrees Celsius, x = 0) = hfs (70 degrees Celsius) ≈ 292.88 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table A-2)  

hen,12 = h (20 degrees Celsius, x = 0) = hfs (20 degrees Celsius) ≈ 83.98 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table A-2)  

Δm12 = 5755 / 83.98 × (292.88 - 430.3) × 1 / (1 - 83.98)  

≈ 109.5 kilograms
