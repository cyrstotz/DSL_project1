T-s diagram:  
The diagram shows a qualitative representation of the process in a T-s diagram. The following states are labeled:  
- 0 → 1: Isentropic, T1  
- 1 → 2: mk (mantle flow), isentropic, T1  
- 2 → 3: mk, isobaric, T1  
- 3 → 4: mk, irreversible turbine  
- 4 → 5: mk + mm (mantle flow + core flow), isobaric  
- 5 → 6: jg (jet flow), isentropic  

Additional notes:  
- T0 is greater than TA.  
- S0 is less than S1.  
- The diagram includes isobars and isentropic lines.  

A note is written: "Sorry, Deutsch-Jalat im Kopf — ich meine isentrop."
