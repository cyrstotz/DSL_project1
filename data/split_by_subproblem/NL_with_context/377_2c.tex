Delta exergy equals exergy specific minus exergy zero.  

Delta exergy specific equals mass flow rate times (h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0) plus w6 squared divided by 2) minus mass flow rate times (h0 minus h0 minus T0 times (s0 minus s0) plus w0 squared divided by 2).  

Delta exergy specific equals mass flow rate times (h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0) plus w6 squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2).  

Substance properties:  
h6 minus h0 equals cp times (T6 minus T0).  
s6 minus s0 equals cp times ln(T6 divided by T0) minus R times ln(p6 divided by p0).  
ln(p6 divided by p0) equals 0.  

Delta exergy specific equals cp times (T6 minus T0) minus T0 times cp times ln(T6 divided by T0) minus w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy specific divided by mass flow rate equals cp times (T6 minus T0) minus T0 times cp times ln(T6 divided by T0) minus w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy specific divided by mass flow rate equals 1.006 joules per gram Kelvin times (T6 minus T0) minus 1.006 times 10 to the power of 3 joules per kilogram Kelvin times T0 times ln(T6 divided by T0) minus w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta exergy specific divided by mass flow rate equals 37,551.573 joules per kilogram minus 37,551 kilojoules per kilogram minus 37,551 kilojoules per kilogram equals delta exergy specific.
