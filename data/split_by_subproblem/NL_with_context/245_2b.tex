The equation for temperature ratio is written as:  
T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 5 equals open parenthesis p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 5 close parenthesis raised to the power of open parenthesis n minus 1 divided by n close parenthesis.  

Substituting values:  
T subscript 6 equals T subscript 5 multiplied by open parenthesis 0.191 divided by 0.5 close parenthesis raised to the power of 0.9 divided by 1.4.  
T subscript 6 equals 328.07 K.  

The velocity equation is written as:  
w equals A multiplied by v dot divided by v subscript c equals w subscript 5 minus w subscript 6 divided by w subscript 6.  

Substituting values:  
w subscript 6 equals w subscript 5 multiplied by open parenthesis T subscript 5 divided by T subscript 6 close parenthesis raised to the power of open parenthesis n minus 1 divided by n close parenthesis.  

Final result:  
w subscript 6 equals 437.486 meters per second.
