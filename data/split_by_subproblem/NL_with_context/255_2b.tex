5 to 6, isentropic nozzle:  

T6 = T5 multiplied by (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (kappa minus 1 divided by kappa) = 328.02797 K

7. HS (Energy Balance):  

0 = m multiplied by (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2) plus Q  

Q = 0  

2 multiplied by (h6 minus h5) = w5 squared minus w6 squared  
=> w6 squared = w5 squared minus 2 multiplied by (h6 minus h5)  
=> w6 = square root of (w5 squared minus 2 multiplied by (h6 minus h5))  
=> w6 = 200 meters per second  

h6 minus h5 = cp multiplied by (T6 minus T5) = -106.45 kilojoules per kilogram
