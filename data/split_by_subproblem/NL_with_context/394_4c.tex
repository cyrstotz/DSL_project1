The equation for the mass flow rate is written as:  
\( \dot{m} \cdot (h_4 - h_1) + Q_{41} - \dot{W}_{41} \).  
The term \( Q_{41} \) is crossed out, and the process is labeled as "adiabatic."  

Additional notes:  
- \( h_4 = h_s(8 \, \text{bar}) = 264.15 \, \text{kJ/kg} \) (referencing Table A-11).  
- \( p_4 = p_3 \).  
- \( h_1 = h_f + x_1 \cdot (h_g - h_f) \).  
- \( h_1 - h_f \) divided by \( h_g - h_f \) equals \( x_1(p_1) \).
