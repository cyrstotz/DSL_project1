Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream six minus exergy stream zero.  
Delta exergy stream six to zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by open parenthesis h zero minus h six minus T zero multiplied by open parenthesis s zero minus s six close parenthesis close parenthesis plus one divided by two multiplied by mass flow rate multiplied by w zero squared minus one divided by two multiplied by mass flow rate multiplied by w six squared.  

h zero at 0.1916 bar and negative 30 degrees Celsius equals 243.15 minus 240.02.  
h zero equals A equals 240, B equals 250, C equals 243.15 minus 240.02, D equals 250.05 times 10 to the power of three.  
Arrow h zero equals C plus B divided by 250 minus 240 (B minus C) equals 243.179.45 plus 243.779.16 divided by kg.  

Arrow h six equals 328.398 times 10 to the power of two divided by kg.  

s zero:  
A equals 240, C equals 7.78229, B equals 250, D equals 1.73723, 57971 equals C plus 210.7296 (B minus C) divided by equals.  
s zero equals 14991.73 equals 7.89913.70.  

Arrow h zero minus h six minus T zero multiplied by open parenthesis s zero minus s six close parenthesis plus one divided by two multiplied by mass flow rate multiplied by w zero squared minus one divided by two multiplied by mass flow rate multiplied by w six squared equals.  

s six:  
A equals 325, C equals 7.78229, B equals 330, D equals 1.73723, 326.07K minus 325 equals C plus 7.30 minus 336 (D minus C).  

s six equals 17991.99 equals 7.79997.10.  

Arrow delta exergy stream equals 173.079.77 divided by kg.
