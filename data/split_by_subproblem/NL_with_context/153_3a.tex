Given: T gas equals 500 degrees Celsius, V gas equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.  

P gas equals m times R times T divided by V.  

R equals R universal divided by M equals 8.314 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilojoules per mole Kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

P equals F divided by A equals 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared plus 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 25 times pi times (0.05 meters squared) plus 1 bar plus 405 pascals.  

P equals 8.00949 bar equals 1900949.4006 pascals.  

m equals PV divided by RT equals 5273 kilograms (probably not).  

m equals 1900949.4 pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (500 Kelvin plus 273.15 Kelvin) equals 3.921 kilograms.
