A graph is drawn with axes labeled as "T" (temperature) on the horizontal axis and "p" (pressure) on the vertical axis. The graph includes a curve labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point) and a marked region labeled "-1". The curve appears to represent phase regions.

Energy balance for the reactor.  

Steady-state process:  
Zero equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy in minus enthalpy out minus kinetic energy minus potential energy) plus reaction heat flow plus heat flow to coolant.  

Sum of mass flow rates equals zero.  

Enthalpy in and enthalpy out from Table A-2:  
Enthalpy in equals h_f at 70 degrees Celsius equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.  
Enthalpy out equals h_f at 100 degrees Celsius equals 419.01 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Heat flow to coolant equals mass flow rate times (enthalpy in minus enthalpy out) plus reaction heat flow.  
Equals 0.3 kilograms per second times (292.98 kilojoules per kilogram minus 419.01 kilojoules per kilogram) plus 100 kilowatts.  
Equals 61.8 kilowatts.
