As long as x sub Ice two is greater than zero, ice is present, and the temperature is zero degrees Celsius because all heat supplied flows into the phase transition to water and does not result in a temperature change. Therefore, the temperature must remain at the melting point. T sub g two equals T sub EW two equals zero degrees Celsius due to thermodynamic equilibrium.  

The pressure p sub g two remains the same as in state one, so p sub g two equals p sub g one equals one point nine one zero bar. This is because neither the external pressure nor the mass (m sub K plus m sub EW) has changed.  

T sub g two equals zero degrees Celsius.  
p sub g two equals one point nine one zero bar equals p sub g one.
