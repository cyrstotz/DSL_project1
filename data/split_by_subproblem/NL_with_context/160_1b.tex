Thermodynamic mean temperature:  

T equals the integral from s_a to s_e of T ds divided by (s_a minus s_e).  

T equals Q dot_out divided by s.  

T equals Q dot_out divided by s_a minus s_e.  

s_a minus s_e equals the integral from T_1 to T_s of c_if divided by T dT.  

s_a minus s_e equals c_if multiplied by ln(T_2 divided by T_1).  

T equals Q dot_out divided by c_if multiplied by ln(T_2 divided by T_1).
