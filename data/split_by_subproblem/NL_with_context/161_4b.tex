Another diagram is drawn with axes labeled as "p (bar)" on the vertical axis and "T (째C)" on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes three regions labeled "fest" (solid), "fl체ssig" (liquid), and "dampf" (vapor).  
Points are marked:  
- Point "1" is in the "fl체ssig" region.  
- Point "2" is on the boundary between "fl체ssig" and "dampf."  
- Point "3" is in the "dampf" region.  
Arrows indicate transitions between these points.
