The page contains three diagrams, each labeled with axes and points.  

**Top Diagram:**  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
- The diagram shows a curve with labeled points:  
  - Point 1 is at the bottom left.  
  - Point 2 is higher up, connected to Point 1 by an upward curve.  
  - Point 3 is connected to Point 2 by a straight line labeled 'isobaric'.  
  - Point 4 is connected to Point 3 by a downward curve.  
  - Point 5 is connected to Point 4 by a horizontal line.  
  - Point 6 is connected to Point 5 by a downward curve.  

**Middle Diagram:**  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
- The diagram shows a similar curve with labeled points:  
  - Point 1 is at the bottom left.  
  - Point 2 is higher up, connected to Point 1 by an upward curve.  
  - Point 3 is connected to Point 2 by a straight line.  
  - Point 5 is connected to Point 3 by a downward curve.  
  - Point 6 is connected to Point 5 by a downward curve.  

**Bottom Diagram:**  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T [K]'.  
- The diagram shows a similar curve with labeled points:  
  - Point 1 is at the bottom left.  
  - Point 2 is higher up, connected to Point 1 by an upward curve.  
  - Point 3 is connected to Point 2 by a straight line labeled 'isobaric'.  
  - Point 4 is connected to Point 3 by a downward curve labeled 'isobaric'.  
  - Point 5 is connected to Point 4 by a horizontal line labeled 'isobaric'.  
  - Point 6 is connected to Point 5 by a downward curve.  

No additional text or equations are present.

The equation is written as:  
dS over dt equals the summation of m dot i of t times s i of t plus the integral of dQ dot of t over T G of t plus S dot erz of t.
