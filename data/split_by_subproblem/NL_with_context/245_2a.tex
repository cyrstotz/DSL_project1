A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with the following points and annotations:  
- Point 0 is at the bottom right.  
- Point 2 is higher up and connected to Point 3 by a line labeled "adiabatic, irreversible".  
- Point 3 is connected to Point 4/5 by a horizontal line labeled "isobar".  
- Point 4/5 is connected to Point 6 by a line labeled "adiabatic, reversible".  
- Point 6 is connected back to Point 0 by a horizontal line.
