A diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T [Â°C]".  
- The y-axis is labeled as "p [bar]".  

The diagram shows a curve representing phase regions.  
- The curve starts at point 1, labeled "saturated vapor".  
- Point 2 is labeled "isobar".  
- Point 3 is labeled "isobar".  
- Point 4 is labeled "condensed liquid".  
Arrows indicate transitions between the points along the curve.
