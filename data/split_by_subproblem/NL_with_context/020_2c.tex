ex_str,6 minus ex_str,0 = h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0) plus w6 squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2  

=> w0 = 200 m/s, w6 = 510 m/s, h6 minus h0 = cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0) = 1.006 kJ/kg·K multiplied by (340 K minus 243.15 K) = 97.43 kJ/kg  

s6 minus s0 = cp multiplied by ln(T6 / T0) minus R multiplied by ln(p6 / p0) = 1.006 kJ/kg·K multiplied by ln(340 K / 243.15 K) minus 0.337 kJ/kg·K multiplied by ln(0.5 bar / 0.191 bar) = 0.337 kJ/kg·K  

=> ex_str,6 minus ex_str,0 = 97.43 minus 243.15 K multiplied by (0.337 kJ/kg·K) plus (510 m/s squared divided by 2) minus (200 m/s squared divided by 2)  

Δex_str = 125.47 kJ/kg
