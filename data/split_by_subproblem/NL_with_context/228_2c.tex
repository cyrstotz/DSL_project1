Exergy flow rate equals mass flow rate times the specific exergy, which equals mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 0 minus the product of ambient temperature and the difference between entropy at state 6 and entropy at state 0.  

Kinetic energy at state 6 equals one-half times mass flow rate times velocity at state 6 squared, which equals one-half times mass flow rate times velocity at state 0 squared.  

Exergy flow rate at state 0 equals mass flow rate times specific exergy at state 0, which equals mass flow rate times enthalpy at state 0.  

The change in exergy flow rate equals the exergy flow rate at state 6 minus the exergy flow rate at state 0, which equals mass flow rate times the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 0 minus the product of ambient temperature and the difference between entropy at state 6 and entropy at state 0 plus the change in kinetic energy.  

Change in kinetic energy equals one-half times mass flow rate times the difference between velocity at state 6 squared and velocity at state 0 squared, which equals one-half times mass flow rate times the difference between 510 meters per second squared and 200 meters per second squared.  

From Table A-22:  
Enthalpy at state 0 (243 Kelvin, 0.191 bar) equals the interpolated value between 250.05 and 240.02, calculated as (250 - 243) times (250.05 - 240.02) divided by (250 - 240), which equals 247.04 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Entropy at state 0 minus entropy at state 6 equals the difference between specific entropy at ambient temperature and specific entropy at state 6 minus the product of the gas constant and the natural logarithm of the ratio of pressure at state 0 to pressure at state 6.
