Ideal liquid.  

Entropy balance:  
dS/dt equals sigma m dot si plus sigma Q dot i divided by Tj plus S dot erz.  

0 equals m dot times (sein minus sans) plus Q dot KF divided by T KF.  

sein minus sans equals integral from T aus to T ein of c lf divided by T dt equals c lf times ln(T ein divided by T aus).  

Reversible, no pressure loss, and adiabatic.  

=> Alternative formula:  
Integral from Se to Sa of T ds equals c lf times ln(Te divided by T).  

Boxed equation:  
Integral from Se to Sa of c lf divided by T dt equals c lf times ln(Te divided by T).
