A graph is drawn with the following details:  

- The vertical axis is labeled as "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "S [kJ/K]" (entropy in kilojoules per Kelvin).  
- Several dashed lines are drawn, labeled "Isobare" (isobaric lines).  
- A curved process line is shown, with points labeled "1", "2", and "3".  
- The label "Î·_s = 1/4" appears near the process line.  
- The label "v_nc" appears near another part of the graph.  

No additional text or equations are present.
