A graph is drawn with entropy (s) on the x-axis labeled in [kJ/kg·K] and temperature (T) on the y-axis labeled in [°C]. The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with labeled points:  
- Point 0: "isentrop"  
- Point 1: "isentrop"  
- Point 2: "isobar"  
- Point 3: "isobar"  
- Point 4: "isobar"  
- Point 5: "isobar"  
- Point 6: "isobar p0"  

The graph includes curves and lines connecting these points, with annotations such as "isobar" and "isobar p0" indicating constant pressure processes.

Exergy equals zero equals total entropy.  

Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by (entropy at state 0 minus entropy at state 6) plus heat flow divided by temperature at surroundings plus entropy surroundings.  

Entropy surroundings equals mass flow rate multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0).  

Entropy surroundings equals mass flow rate multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at surroundings) minus pressure divided by density multiplied by the natural logarithm of (pressure at state 6 divided by pressure at surroundings).  

Entropy surroundings divided by mass flow rate equals 1.006 multiplied by the natural logarithm of (340 Kelvin divided by 253.15 Kelvin) equals 0.337727 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Exergy equals total entropy equals negative (301,273.15) plus 0.337727 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin equals 82,003 kilojoules.
