Since the entire heat \( Q_{12} \) enters the process of ice melting and only liquid water remains, \( T_{2, \text{Ice}} = 0^\circ \text{C} \) applies, and thus also \( T_{2, \text{Gas}} = 0^\circ \text{C} \) (due to thermal equilibrium).  
The pressure remains constant in this configuration!  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \)
