\( \dot{m}_{KF} = ? \)  

\( 0 = \dot{m}_{KF} (h_e - h_a) + \dot{Q}_{out} \)  
\( \dot{Q}_{out} = \dot{m}_{KF} (h_a - h_e) \)  

\( h_a - h_e = \int_{T_{KF,in}}^{T_{KF,out}} c_i (T) dT + v (p_{2} - p_{1}) \)  

\( \dot{Q}_{out} = \dot{m}_{KF} \int_{T_{KF,in}}^{T_{KF,out}} c_i (T) dT \)  

\( \dot{m}_{KF} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{out}}{\int_{T_{KF,in}}^{T_{KF,out}} c_i (T) dT} \)  

\( \dot{m}_{KF} = \frac{63.3 \, \text{kW}}{c_i (298.15 - 288.15)} \)  
\( \dot{m}_{KF} = \frac{63.3 \, \text{kW}}{6.33 \, \text{kW/K}} = \dot{m}_{KF} \cdot c_i \)

T mean equals integral from s_a to s_e of T dS divided by s_a minus s_e equals h_a minus h_e divided by s_a minus s_e equals Q out divided by m dot KF times s_a minus s_e equals 6.33 watts per Kelvin times c_if times natural logarithm of T KF out divided by T KF in.  
Arrow leads to 10 Kelvin divided by natural logarithm of 288.15 Kelvin divided by 278.15 Kelvin equals 293.12 Kelvin.
