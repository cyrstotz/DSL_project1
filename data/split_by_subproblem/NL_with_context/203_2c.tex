Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream at state 6 minus exergy stream at state 5, which equals [hc minus hs minus T0 times (sc minus ss) plus Delta kinetic energy plus Delta potential energy].  

Delta exergy stream equals cp times (T6 minus T5) minus T0 times (sc minus ss) plus (w6 squared divided by 2 minus w5 squared divided by 2).  

sc minus ss equals cp times integral from T5 to T6 of (1 divided by T) dT minus R times ln(p6 divided by p5).  

Therefore, Delta exergy stream equals cp times (T6 minus T5) minus T0 times cp times ln(T6 divided by T5) minus R times ln(p6 divided by p5) plus (w6 squared divided by 2 minus w5 squared divided by 2).  

T0 equals negative 30 degrees Celsius equals 243.15 Kelvin.  
R equals cp minus cv equals cp divided by kappa.  

Delta exergy stream equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (340 Kelvin minus 431.9 Kelvin) minus 243.15 Kelvin times 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times ln(340 Kelvin divided by 431.9 Kelvin) minus (1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin divided by 1.4) times ln(0.497 bar divided by 0.5 bar) plus (320 meters per second squared divided by 2 minus 220 meters per second squared divided by 2).  

Delta exergy stream equals negative 4669.299 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Unrealistic.
