Energy balance for the nozzle:  
u equals h6 minus h5 plus (w6 squared minus w5 squared divided by 2).  

Thermodynamic mean temperature equation:  
T6 equals T5 multiplied by (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k), where k equals 1.4.  
T6 equals 828.075 Kelvin.  

For an ideal gas:  
h5 minus h6 equals cp multiplied by (T5 minus T6).  

Velocity w6 is calculated as:  
w6 equals the square root of [m dot divided by m multiplied by cp multiplied by (T5 minus T6) plus w5 squared divided by 2] multiplied by 2.  
w6 equals 220.47 meters per second.  

Additional notes:  
- States 5 to 6 are reversible.  
- P6 equals P0 equals 0.191 bar.  
- w5 equals 220 meters per second.  
- T5 equals 451.9 Kelvin.  
- w inlet equals 0.
