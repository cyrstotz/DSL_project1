T KF equals integral from s a to s e of T d s divided by s a minus s e equals integral from s a to s e of d H divided by s a minus s e equals c f times (T KF out minus T KF in) divided by c f times ln (T KF out divided by T KF in)  

298.15 minus 288.15 divided by ln (298.15 divided by 288.15) equals 293.12 Kelvin
