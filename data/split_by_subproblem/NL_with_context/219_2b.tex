Tc = T5 multiplied by (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k).  
n = k (isentrop)  

Tc = 328.67 K  

1. HS 5 â†’ 6:  
0 = h5 minus h6 plus (w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2)  

=> w6 squared = w5 squared plus 2 multiplied by cp_air multiplied by (T5 minus Tc) = 25730 m squared per s squared  

w6 = 507.24 m/s
