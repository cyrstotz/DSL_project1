T_g2 = 0.002 degrees Celsius  

Energy balance around gas: Closed, at equilibrium  
m times (u_2 minus u_1) = Q_12 minus W_v  

W_v = R times (T_g2 minus T_g1) divided by (1 minus n)  

m times c_v times (T_g2 minus T_g1) plus W_v = Q_12  

n = c_p divided by c_v = 1.2626  
c_p = R divided by m_g plus c_v = 0.29228
