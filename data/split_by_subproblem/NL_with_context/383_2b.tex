Energy balance around the nozzle:  
0 = m dot times [h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2]  

The equation is partially crossed out and rewritten:  
h5 minus h6 equals ... (crossed out content).  

=> w6 equals square root of [2 times (h5 minus h6) plus w5 squared]  
=> w6 equals square root of [2 times (1046.45 kJ/kg minus ...) plus (220 m/s squared)]  
=> w6 equals 220.97 m/s  

An asterisk (*) is drawn next to the rewritten equation.

T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n.  

Specific heat capacity Cp equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

n equals k equals 1.4.  

T6 equals T5 times (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n.  

T6 equals 431.9 Kelvin times (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 1 minus 1.4 divided by 1.4.  

h5 minus h6 equals Cp times (T5 minus T6).  

h5 minus h6 equals 104.95 kilojoules per kilogram.  

T6 equals 328 Kelvin.
