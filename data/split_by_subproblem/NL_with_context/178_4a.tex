A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p (pressure)" and the x-axis labeled as "T [K] (temperature in Kelvin)." The graph depicts a phase diagram with a curved boundary. Four points are marked:  
- Point 1 is on the lower right side of the curve.  
- Point 2 is on the lower left side of the curve.  
- Point 3 is at the top of the curve.  
- Point 4 is on the upper right side of the curve.  
Arrows indicate the transitions between points:  
- From point 1 to point 2.  
- From point 2 to point 3.  
- From point 3 to point 4.
