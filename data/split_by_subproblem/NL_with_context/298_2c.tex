Delta ex_str between states 6 and 0  

Delta ex_str equals delta EX_str divided by m dot equals (h_6 minus h_0) minus (T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0)) plus delta ke.  

Delta ke equals w_6 squared divided by 2 minus w_0 squared divided by 2.  

From gas laws: h_6 minus h_0 equals c_p multiplied by (T_0 minus T_6).  
From general laws: s_6 minus s_0 equals s_6 minus s_0 equals c_p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_0 divided by T_6) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p_0 divided by p_6).  

R equals c_p minus c_v implies kappa equals c_p divided by c_v.  

R equals c_p minus c_p divided by kappa equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 1.006 divided by 1.4 equals 0.287 equals c_p multiplied by j.  

This implies delta ex_str equals (c_p multiplied by j multiplied by (T_0 minus T_6) minus T_0 multiplied by (natural logarithm of (T_0 divided by T_6) multiplied by c_p multiplied by j minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p_0 divided by p_6)) plus (w_6 squared divided by 2 minus w_0 squared divided by 2)).
