Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph. It includes labeled regions for "dampf" (vapor), "wasser" (water), and "eis" (ice). The vapor region is boxed, and lines separate the regions.  
2. The second diagram is another p-T graph with labeled states: "3", "4", and "1". The regions "dampf" (vapor) and "wasser" (water) are labeled. The state transitions are marked with arrows.
