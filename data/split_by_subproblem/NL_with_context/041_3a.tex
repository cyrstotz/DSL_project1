T_g,1 equals 500 degrees Celsius.  
V_g,1 equals 3.14 liters.  

p_g,1 times V_g,1 equals R times T_g,1.  

p_g,1 equals R divided by M times m_g divided by V_g,1.  

V_g,1 equals V_g,1 divided by m_g,1 equals 0.0000628 cubic meters per kilogram.  

m_g equals ?.  

A diagram is shown with a labeled cylinder containing gas and a piston.  

F equals m_K times g equals 32.1 times 9.81.  
A equals pi times (5 cm) squared.  

p equals F divided by A equals 32.1 times 9.81 divided by pi times (5 cm) squared equals 0.4091 bar.  

m_g equals p_g times V_g,1 divided by R divided by T_g,1 equals 0.9769 kilograms equals 0.98 kilograms.  

R divided by M.
