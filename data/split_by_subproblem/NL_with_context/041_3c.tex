Delta U equals Q subscript 12 minus W subscript 12.

U subscript 2 minus U subscript 1 equals Q subscript 12 minus W subscript 12.  
Mass remains constant.

u subscript 2 minus u subscript 1 equals q subscript 12 minus w subscript 12.

Q subscript 12 equals U subscript 2 minus U subscript 1 plus W subscript 12.  
Only from gas (volume work).  
Equals m subscript EW times (u subscript 2EW minus u subscript 1EW) plus m subscript g times (u subscript 2g minus u subscript 1g) plus integral from 1 to 2 of p dV.  
Volume work.

rho integral from 1 to 2 of dV equals (V subscript 2 minus V subscript 1).  
9.4 bar.

Isentropic relation:  
T subscript 2 divided by T subscript 1 equals (V subscript 1 divided by V subscript 2) raised to the power of n minus 1.

n equals k equals R divided by c subscript V plus c subscript V divided by c subscript V equals 1.2627.

V subscript 1 divided by V subscript 2 equals (T subscript 2 divided by T subscript 1) raised to the power of 1 divided by n minus 1.

V subscript 2 equals V subscript 1 times (T subscript 2 divided by T subscript 1) raised to the power of 1 divided by n minus 1 equals V subscript 1 divided by m subscript g times 1 divided by (273.15 divided by (500 plus 273.15)) raised to the power of 1 divided by n minus 1 equals 0.1682.

V subscript 2 equals m subscript g times V subscript 2.

rho integral from 1 to 2 of dV equals 0.006167.
