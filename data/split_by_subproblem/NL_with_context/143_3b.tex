p sub g,2 equals p sub g,1 equals 1.4 bar, since the same pressure due to atmosphere and weight still acts.  

Polytropic:  
R plus C sub V divided by C sub V equals k equals 1.263.  

T sub g,2 equals T sub g,1 times (p sub 2 divided by p sub 1) raised to the power of k minus 1 divided by k equals 773.75 kelvin.
