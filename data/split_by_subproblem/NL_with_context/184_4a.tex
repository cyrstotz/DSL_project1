A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and specific volume (v) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes multiple curves. One curve is labeled "nicht beachtet" (not considered).  

Another graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and specific volume (v) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled regions:  
- "gasförmig/flüssig" (gaseous/liquid)  
- "fest" (solid)  
- "flüssig/gasförmig" (liquid/gaseous)  

The graph also includes points labeled "1," "2," "3," and "4."
