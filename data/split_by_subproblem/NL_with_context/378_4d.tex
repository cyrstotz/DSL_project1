q sub k equals Q dot sub k divided by V dot sub t equals Q dot sub k divided by W dot sub t equals Q dot sub k divided by twenty-eight W  

Q dot sub k arrow  

Delta Z divided by Delta t equals m dot multiplied by h sub 2 minus h sub 1 plus Q dot sub 2v minus W dot sub v crossed out  

Q dot sub 2v equals m dot multiplied by h sub 2 minus h sub 1  

Therefore, E sub k equals m dot multiplied by h sub 2 minus h sub 1 divided by twenty-eight W

p equals p3,4 equals 7.4 bar  
Q equals 15000  

Delta E equals dE over dt equals Q in minus Q out minus W  

Delta E equals constant absolute value of Q out  

Delta u times m2 equals absolute value of Q out equals 15000 over h g  

Delta m equals crossed-out content  

Therefore, x equals x freezing plus Delta x minus Delta u equals 0.04  
Therefore, x EW equals x freezing EW equals 0.9330 equals 1 minus x freezing  

Two small diagrams are drawn:  
- Left diagram labeled "u liquid" and "u gas" with "p EW" below.  
- Right diagram labeled "u liquid" and "u gas" with "p freezing" below.
