x_ice,2 is greater than 0.  
T_g,2 = ?  
p_g,2 = ?  

R and m are constant.  
V is smaller.  
p_g,2 is not dependent on volume but rather on pressure and mass.  

T_2 equals pV divided by mR.  
T is smaller.  

Polytropic temperature ratio:  
T_2 equals T_1 multiplied by (p_2 divided by p_1) to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

C_p equals R plus C_v, which equals 0.1663 kilojoules per kilogram per kelvin plus 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram per kelvin, which equals 0.7993 kilojoules per kilogram per kelvin.

K equals c subscript p divided by c subscript v equals 0.7993 divided by 0.633 equals 1.263.  

V becomes smaller, p becomes larger, and since the gas also loses heat, T becomes smaller.  

T subscript 2 equals 773 K multiplied by (p subscript x divided by 1.5) multiplied by (0.26 divided by 1.26).
