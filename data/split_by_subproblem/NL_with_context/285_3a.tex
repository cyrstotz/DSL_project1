p sub g multiplied by V equals m multiplied by R multiplied by T.  
R equals 8.314 divided by M equals 8.314 divided by 0.05 equals 166.28.  
m equals m sub K plus m sub EW equals 32 kilograms.  

p sub g,1 equals p sub amb plus (32 kilograms divided by 6.05 meters squared) equals 40870.59 pascals plus 70000 pascals equals 110870.59 pascals.  

m equals p multiplied by V divided by R multiplied by T equals (110870.59 multiplied by 0.00314) divided by (166.28 multiplied by 773.15) equals 3.041 grams.
