A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a cycle with four labeled points: 1, 2, 3, and 4. The paths between these points are marked as follows:  
- Between point 1 and point 2: "Isentrop" (isentropic).  
- Between point 2 and point 3: "Isobar" (isobaric).  
- Between point 3 and point 4: "Isother" (isothermal).  
- Between point 4 and point 1: "ND".
