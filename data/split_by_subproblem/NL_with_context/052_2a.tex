A table is drawn with columns labeled as \( Z \), \( p [\text{bar}] \), \( T [\text{K}] \), \( h \), and \( s \). The rows contain the following values:  
- Row 5: \( p = 0.5 \), \( T = 431.9 \)  
- Row 6: \( p = 0.191 \), \( T = 328.075 \)  

Below the table, a graph is drawn with the axes labeled as \( T [\text{K}] \) (vertical axis) and \( s [\text{kJ/kgK}] \) (horizontal axis). The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The process includes isobaric and adiabatic segments.  
- Arrows indicate the direction of the process.
