Negative delta E subscript xstr equals E subscript xstr,0 minus E subscript xstr,G.  

m dot times (h subscript 0 minus h subscript c minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript 0 minus s subscript 6) plus delta ke).  

Negative e subscript xstr equals h subscript 0 minus h subscript c minus T subscript 0 times (s subscript 0 minus s subscript 6) plus w subscript 0 squared minus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2.  

e subscript xstr equals c subscript p times (T subscript 0 minus T subscript 6) minus T subscript 0 times (ln T subscript 0 divided by T subscript 6) minus R times (ln p subscript 0 divided by p subscript 6) plus w subscript 0 squared minus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2.  

Equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram times (297.15 Kelvin minus 328.1 Kelvin) minus 243.751 Kelvin times (ln (297.15 Kelvin divided by 328.1 Kelvin)) minus 0.247 kilojoules per kilogram times (ln (1)) plus 200 squared meters per second squared divided by 2 minus 329 squared meters per second squared divided by 2.  

Delta e subscript xstr equals 119.5 kilojoules per kilogram.
