Pressure at state 2 equals pressure at state 1 (no pressure change because the pressure from gravity and piston remains constant).  

Interpolation of temperature from table:  
Temperature at 1.4 bar equals temperature at 1.4 bar minus temperature at 1.2 bar divided by pressure difference (1.2 bar minus 1.0 bar).  

Equals negative 0.012 degrees Celsius (temperature must be negative because of the phase transition of ice to water).
