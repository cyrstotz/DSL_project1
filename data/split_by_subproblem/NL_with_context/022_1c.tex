0 equals m multiplied by (s c minus s a) plus Q dot divided by T plus S erz.  

Diagram:  
A reactor is shown with an inlet at 70 degrees Celsius and an outlet at 100 degrees Celsius. The reactor is labeled "Reaktor," and the cooling jacket is labeled "Mantel." Heat flows \( Q_{aus} \) and \( Q_{cw} \) are indicated.  

Equation:  
0 equals Q dot divided by T plus S erz equals Q cw divided by T n plus Q cw divided by T 2.  
S erz equals Q cw divided by T 2 minus Q cw divided by T n.  
S erz equals Q cw multiplied by (1 divided by T 2 minus 1 divided by T n).  
S erz equals Q cw multiplied by (1 divided by 298.15 minus 1 divided by 288.15).  
S erz equals 0.0461 kilowatts per Kelvin.
