Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled "p (bar)" on the y-axis and "T (K)" on the x-axis. It shows a dome-shaped curve with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - Points 1 and 2 are connected by a horizontal line labeled "Isobar."  
   - Points 3 and 4 are connected by another horizontal line labeled "Isobar."  
   - The curve represents a phase diagram.  

2. The second diagram is also labeled "p" on the y-axis and "T" on the x-axis. It shows a similar dome-shaped curve with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - Points 1 and 2 are connected by a horizontal line labeled "fl체ssigkeit" (liquid).  
   - Points 3 and 4 are connected by a horizontal line labeled "ges채ttigter dampf" (saturated vapor).  
   - The curve is annotated with "fl체ssigkeit" (liquid) on the left side and "ges채ttigter dampf" (saturated vapor) on the right side.
