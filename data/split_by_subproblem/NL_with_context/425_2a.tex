A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph represents a T-s diagram with several points labeled:  
- Point 0: \( p_0 = p_6 \)  
- Point 1: Isentropic  
- Point 2: \( p_2 = p_3 \)  
- Point 3: \( p_3 = p_2 \)  
- Point 4: \( p_4 = p_5 \)  
- Point 5: \( p_5 = p_4 \)  
- Point 6: \( p_0 = p_6 \)  

The diagram includes isobars and arrows indicating transitions between states. There is shading between points 2 and 3.
