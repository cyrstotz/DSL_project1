Delta U equals Q12.  

Delta U equals mEW multiplied by (u2 minus u1) equals Q12.  

mEW equals mIce plus mWater.  

u2 equals Q12 divided by mEW plus u1 equals negative 122.58 kilojoules per kilogram.  

uIce equals uIce at 0 degrees Celsius equals uIce at 1 atmosphere plus x multiplied by (uIce at 0 degrees Celsius minus uIce at 1 atmosphere).  

uIce equals 333.458 plus 0.6 multiplied by (0.045 minus 0.333 multiplied by 333.458).  

uIce equals negative 133.4102 kilojoules per kilogram.  

T EW equals 0 degrees Celsius.  

0.003 is less than x.  

x2 equals u2 minus uIce divided by uIce at freezing minus uIce at freezing.  

x2 equals 0.632.
