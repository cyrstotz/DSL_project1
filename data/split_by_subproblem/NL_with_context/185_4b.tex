The mass flow rate (\( \dot{m} \)) is calculated using an energy balance for the entire system.  
The equation is written as:  
\( \dot{W}_k / \dot{m} = w_k + kev \)  
\( w_k \) is defined as the integral of \( dp \):  
\( w_k = \int dp \)  

This leads to:  
\( \dot{m} = \dot{W}_k / w_k \)  

Temperature relationships are mentioned but crossed out.  
A general energy equation is written:  
\( \Delta U = q - W \)
