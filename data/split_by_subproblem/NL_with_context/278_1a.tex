Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled "a)" and shows a wavy curve on a graph. The vertical axis is labeled "p [bar]" and the horizontal axis is labeled "T [K]".  

2. The second diagram is a graph with a curved line. The vertical axis is labeled "p [bar]" and the horizontal axis is labeled "T [K]". The graph includes annotations:  
   - "fed" near the start of the curve.  
   - "isotherm" written along the curve.  
   - "flowing gas" written near the top of the curve.
