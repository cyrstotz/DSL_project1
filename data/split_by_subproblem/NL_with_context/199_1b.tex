T bar equals integral from s_1 to s_2 of T ds divided by integral from s_1 to s_2 of ds.  

ds equals dQ divided by T.  

T bar equals delta Q divided by ln of T_2 divided by T_1 equals T_2 minus T_1 divided by ln of T_2 divided by T_1 equals 298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by ln of 298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin equals 293.12 Kelvin.
