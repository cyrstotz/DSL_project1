The inlet mass flow rate is \( \dot{m}_{in} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \).  

a) \( \dot{Q}_{out} \):  
\( \dot{Q}_R = 100,000 \, \text{W} \)  
\( T_R = 100^\circ \text{C} = 373.15 \, \text{K} \)  

Steady-state fluid process:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} (\text{h}_e - \text{h}_a) + \dot{Q}_R - \dot{Q}_{out} \, (\text{Reaction}) \)  

\( 0 = \dot{m}_K (\text{h}_{ER} - \text{h}_{AK}) + \dot{Q}_{out} \)  

\( m_{ges} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \)  
\( x_D = 0.005 \)  

b)  
\( \bar{T} = \int_a^c T \, \text{d}s / (s_a - s_c) \)  

c)  
\( \dot{S}_{erz} = - \dot{Q}_{out} / \bar{T} \)  

d)  
\( \Delta E = \sum m_i (\text{h}_i T) + \sum Q_i \)

A diagram is drawn with the vertical axis labeled as "p" (pressure) and the horizontal axis labeled as "T" (temperature).  

The diagram includes:  
- A dome-shaped curve labeled "Nass-Dampf" (wet steam).  
- To the left of the curve, the region is labeled "flüssig" (liquid).  
- To the right of the curve, the region is labeled "gasförmig Dampf" (gaseous steam).  
- Below the curve, the horizontal line is labeled "test" and "test Pastorizie" (with "Pastorizie" crossed out).
