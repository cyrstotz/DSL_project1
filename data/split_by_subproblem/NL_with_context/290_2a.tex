A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]' and the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The graph shows several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked.  
- Curves labeled as 'p3 = p3', 'p5 = p4', and 'p0'.  
- A note is written: "blaue Kurve nicht beachten!" (Do not consider the blue curve!).
