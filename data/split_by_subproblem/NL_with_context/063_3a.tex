A = 5 centimeters squared times pi equals 0.00785 cubic meters.  
F = m times g equals 317.9 Newtons.  
p_e = 317.9 Newtons divided by 7.85 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters equals 0.84 bar.  
P = 1 bar plus 0.9 bar equals 1.9 bar.  
M = 50 kilograms per kilomole.  
m = p times V divided by R times T equals 0.0034 kilograms equals 3.4 grams.  
T = 773.75 Kelvin.  
Ï† = 7.9 times 10 to the power of 3 Pascal.  
R = R bar divided by M equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole Kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole equals 766.28 joules per kilogram Kelvin.  
V = 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.
