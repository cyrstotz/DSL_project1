A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points corresponding to states in the jet engine process. The diagram includes:  
- Axes labeled as 'T (h)' for temperature and 's (kJ/kgÂ·K)' for entropy.  
- Points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Processes between points are marked as 'isotrop' (adiabatic and reversible) and 'same pressure'.  
- Isobars are drawn and noted as "isobars are a little steep, they should probably be more like //".
