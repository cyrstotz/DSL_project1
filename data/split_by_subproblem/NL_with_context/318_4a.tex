A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T [K]) on the x-axis. The graph includes labeled regions and points:  
- "Fest" (solid)  
- "Flüssig" (liquid)  
- "Gasförmig" (gaseous)  
- "Triple" (triple point)  
- Two isothermal lines labeled "isotherm"  
- Two points labeled "i" and "ii"
