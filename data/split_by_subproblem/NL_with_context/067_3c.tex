EB (Closed System)  

m two u two minus m one u one equals Q one two minus W one two  

m total (u two EW plus u two gas minus u one EW minus u one gas) equals Q one two minus W one two  

m total times c V times (T two minus T one) plus  

W one two equals m integral from one to two of (p zero plus p k) dV equals m times (p zero plus p k) times (V two minus V one)
