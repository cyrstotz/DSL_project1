\( ex_{\text{verl}} = T_0 \cdot S_{\text{erz}} \)  

\( S_{\text{erz}} = m \cdot \left[ s_6 - s_5 + s_5 - s_0 \right] \)  

\( s_6 = s_5 \)  
\( s_5 = s_0 \)  

\( S_{\text{erz}} = m \cdot \left[ s_6 - s_0 \right] \)

Exergy loss equals negative exergy of the stream plus the term one minus the ratio of T zero to T B, multiplied by q B.  

Exergy loss equals 100 multiplied by one minus 293.15 divided by 1289, which equals 35 minus 969.7.  

Final result: negative 969.7.
