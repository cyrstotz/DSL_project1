A graph is drawn with temperature (T) in Kelvin on the vertical axis and entropy (S) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The curve between points 0 and 1 is labeled "isobar."  
- The curve between points 1 and 2 is labeled "isentrop."  
- The curve between points 2 and 3 is labeled "isobar."  
- The curve between points 3 and 4 is labeled "isentrop."  
- The curve between points 4 and 5 is labeled "isobar."  
- The curve between points 5 and 6 is labeled "isentrop."  
Additional annotations include:  
- "p2 = p3" near the graph.  
- "0.5 bar / p0 = 0.191 bar" near point 0.
