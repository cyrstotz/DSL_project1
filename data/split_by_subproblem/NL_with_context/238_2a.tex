A graph is drawn with the temperature (T) in Kelvin on the vertical axis and entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a qualitative T-s diagram for the jet engine process.  
- The diagram includes labeled isobars and adiabatic processes.  
- Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curve.  
- The process between points 1 and 2 is labeled as "isentrop."  
- The curve between points 2 and 3 is labeled "wie es wirklich verl√§uft" (how it actually proceeds).
