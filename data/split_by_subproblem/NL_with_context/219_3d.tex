1. HS EW:  
m subscript EW (u two minus u one) equals Q one two.  

u one equals u subscript f plus x one (u subscript S minus u subscript f).  
Equals minus 200.03 kJ/kg (from Table 1).  

u two equals Q one two divided by m subscript EW plus u one.  
Equals u subscript f plus x two (u subscript S minus u subscript f).  

u two equals minus 183.94 kJ/kg (from Table 2).  

Therefore, x two equals (u two minus u subscript f) divided by (u subscript S minus u subscript f).  
Equals 0.5638.
