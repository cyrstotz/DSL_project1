p6 = p0 = 0.191 bar  

dE/dt = 0 = m [h6 - h5 + (w6 squared minus w5 squared) divided by 2]  

h5 - h6 = cp (T5 - T6)  
T6 = T5 (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n)  

T6 = 431.9 (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4 = 328.07 K  

h5 - h6 = 104.46 kJ/kg  

kes - ke6 = 1/2 (w5 squared minus w6 squared)  

w6 squared = 208.92 times 10 raised to the power of 7 minus w5 squared = [value crossed out].
