Area equals 0.05 square meters times pi.  

Pressure at state 1 (p_g1) equals:  
32 times 9.81 plus 0.1 times 9.81 plus 10.5 times 0.05 times pi divided by 0.05 times pi.  

p_g1 equals approximately 1.4 bar.  

Mass of gas (m_g):  
pV equals mRT.  

m_g equals p_g1 times V_g1 divided by R times T_g1.  

Gas constant (R) equals 8.314 joules per mole per kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole.  

m_g equals (1.4 times 10^5 times 3.14 times 10^-3) divided by (83.14 divided by 50 times 773.15).  

m_g equals 0.0639 kilograms equals 3.19 grams.
