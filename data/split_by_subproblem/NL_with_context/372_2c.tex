w subscript 6 equals 510 meters per second  

Delta ex subscript str equals ex subscript str comma 6 minus ex subscript str comma 0  

ex subscript str equals m dot multiplied by h subscript a minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus w squared divided by 2  

ex subscript str comma 0 equals m dot multiplied by (h subscript a minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2)  

Delta ex subscript str equals m dot multiplied by (h subscript a minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2)  

h subscript a minus h subscript 0 equals c subscript p comma Luft multiplied by (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) equals 85.435 kilojoules per kilogram  

s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0 equals c subscript p comma Luft multiplied by ln (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) minus R multiplied by ln (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 0)  

equals c subscript p comma Luft multiplied by ln (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) equals 0.301 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  

w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 0 squared divided by 2 equals 103850  

Arrow pointing right: falls is relevant directly into the equation
