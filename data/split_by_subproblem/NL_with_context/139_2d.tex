Adiabatic system:  
\( \Delta E = \Sigma \dot{m} (h_i + w_i^2 / 2) + Q_B = 0 \), noting "at the beginning and end, the system is in equilibrium."  

Energy balance:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a - w_e^2 - w_a^2 / 2 + g (z_e - z_a)) + \dot{Q}_{13} - V \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \), noting "at the beginning and end, the system is in equilibrium."  

Simplified equation:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a - w_e^2 - w_a^2 / 2 + \dot{Q}_{13}) \).  

Final equation:  
\( w_a = \sqrt{\frac{-\dot{Q}_{13}}{\dot{m}} (h_e - h_a) - 200^2} \), labeled as "calculation from \( T_6 \)."  

Additional notes and symbols are present but not clearly transcribable.
