Negative delta exergy stream divided by mass flow rate equals enthalpy at state 0 minus enthalpy at state a minus temperature at state 0 multiplied by entropy at state e minus entropy at state a plus velocity at state e squared minus velocity at state a squared divided by two.  

Negative delta exergy stream divided by mass flow rate equals enthalpy at negative thirty degrees Celsius minus enthalpy at three hundred forty Kelvin minus temperature at state 0 multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of temperature at state 0 divided by temperature at state 0 plus velocity at state e squared minus velocity at state a squared divided by two.  

Enthalpy at two hundred forty Kelvin equals enthalpy at two hundred forty Kelvin plus two hundred forty-three point one five kilojoules per kilogram minus two hundred forty Kelvin multiplied by enthalpy at two hundred fifty Kelvin minus enthalpy at two hundred forty Kelvin.  

Enthalpy at two hundred forty-three point one five Kelvin equals two hundred forty-three point one five zero kilojoules per kilogram.  

Negative delta exergy stream divided by mass flow rate equals two hundred forty-three point one five zero kilojoules per kilogram minus three hundred forty point four two kilojoules per kilogram plus two hundred squared meters per second squared divided by two minus five hundred ten squared meters per second squared divided by two.  

Delta exergy stream divided by mass flow rate equals eleven thousand twenty-nine point two seven kilojoules per kilogram.
