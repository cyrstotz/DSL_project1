T KF equals 293 Kelvin divided by Q dot out equals 65 kilowatts.  

Diagram:  
A horizontal bar labeled Q dot out with arrows pointing outward labeled "wall."  
T reactor equals 373.15 Kelvin.  

Delta S erz equals Q dot out divided by T KF minus Q dot out divided by T reactor plus S erz.  
Delta S erz equals Q dot out divided by T KF minus Q dot out divided by T reactor equals 46.146 kilojoules.
