A diagram is drawn showing a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
- The graph includes labeled regions: "solid," "liquid," and "gas."  
- A triple point is marked, with an annotation "5 mbar unter dem Tripelpunkt" (5 mbar below the triple point).  
- Points labeled "1," "2," and "3" are marked on the graph.  
- Arrows indicate transitions between states.  

Annotations:  
1) Isobaric freezing: Pressure remains constant, temperature decreases. State: solid.  
2) Isothermal sublimation: Pressure decreases, temperature remains constant. State: gas.
