Energy balance SFP:  
O equals m dot multiplied by delta ex subscript str.  

delta ex subscript str equals the quantity h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by the quantity s subscript 5 minus s subscript 6 plus w subscript 5 squared minus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2.  

h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 equals c subscript p multiplied by the quantity T subscript 5 minus T subscript 6.  

s subscript 5 minus s subscript 6 equals c subscript p multiplied by the natural logarithm of the quantity T subscript 5 divided by T subscript 6 minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of the quantity p subscript 5 divided by p subscript 6.
