A diagram is drawn showing a reactor with inlet and outlet flows labeled \( \dot{m}_{in} \) and \( \dot{m}_{out} \), respectively. The mass of the reactor contents is labeled as \( m_{total} = 5755 \, \text{kg} \), and the steam quality is \( x_D = 0.005 \). The reactor is marked as operating in steady state ("station√§r"). Heat flows \( \dot{Q}_R \) and \( \dot{Q}_{out} \) are indicated, along with the coolant flow labeled \( KF \).  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\( \dot{Q}_{out} = \dot{m}_{in} h_1 - \dot{m}_{out} h_2 + \dot{Q}_R - W_{t} \).  

The enthalpy difference is calculated:  
\( Q = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_1) + \dot{Q}_R \).  

Substituting values:  
\( Q = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \cdot (h_2 - h_1) \).  

From the water tables:  
\( h_2 (100^\circ \text{C}, x_2 = 0) = h_f (100^\circ \text{C}) = 419.04 \, \text{kJ/kg} \, \text{(TAB 42)} \).  
\( h_1 (70^\circ \text{C}, x_1 = 0) = 292.98 \, \text{kJ/kg} \, \text{(TAB 42)} \).  

Calculation:  
\( Q = 0.3 \, \text{kg/s} \cdot (419.04 - 292.98) = 37.818 \, \text{kW} \).  

Adding \( \dot{Q}_R \):  
\( \dot{Q}_{out} = 37.818 \, \text{kW} + 100 \, \text{kW} = 137.818 \, \text{kW} \).
