A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points and processes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's (kJ/kgÂ·K)'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T (K)'.  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked.  
- The process from 1 to 2 is labeled as 'adiabat s = const reversibel'.  
- The process from 2 to 3 is labeled as 'isobar p2 = p3'.  
- The process from 3 to 4 is labeled as 'adiabat irreversibel'.  
- The process from 4 to 5 is labeled as 'isobar'.  
- The process from 5 to 6 is labeled as 'adiabat'.  
- The pressure values are noted:  
  - 'p5 = 0.5 bar'.  
  - 'p0 = p6 = 0.1916 bar'.
