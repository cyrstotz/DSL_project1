T_g2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.  

Not all the ice has melted, and yet both chambers are in thermodynamic equilibrium. That means the EW has a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius, and the gas does too.  

p_g2 equals p_g1 equals 1.4 bar.  

The atmospheric pressure and the weight force of the piston and EW still press on the same area. The EW remains constant in density. Therefore, the pressure remains constant.
