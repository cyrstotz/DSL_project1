Zero equals mass flow rate times the difference between specific enthalpy at the exit and specific enthalpy at the inlet, plus reaction heat flow plus heat flow removed.  
Mass flow rate equals negative reaction heat flow plus heat flow removed divided by the difference between specific enthalpy at the exit and specific enthalpy at the inlet.
