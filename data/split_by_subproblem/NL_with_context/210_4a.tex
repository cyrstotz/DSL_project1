Three diagrams are drawn, each representing pressure (P) versus temperature (T) for different phases of R134a refrigerant.  

1. **Top Diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled as P (pressure) in unspecified units on the vertical axis and T (temperature) in Kelvin [K] on the horizontal axis.  
   - Three phase regions are marked:  
     - "fest" (solid phase)  
     - "flüssig" (liquid phase)  
     - "gas" (gaseous phase)  
   - The "Tripel" (triple point) is labeled at the intersection of the solid, liquid, and gas phase boundaries.  

2. **Middle Diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled similarly as P [bar] on the vertical axis and T [K] on the horizontal axis.  
   - Three phase regions are marked:  
     - "fest" (solid phase)  
     - "flüssig" (liquid phase)  
     - "gasförmig" (gaseous phase)  
   - The "Tripel" (triple point) is labeled.  
   - Two steps are indicated:  
     - Step "i" is shown as a horizontal arrow moving from the solid phase into the liquid phase.  
     - Step "ii" is shown as a vertical arrow moving from the liquid phase into the gaseous phase.  
   - Points "0" and "z" are marked along the paths.  

3. **Bottom Diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled as P [bar] on the vertical axis and T [K] on the horizontal axis.  
   - Phase boundaries are drawn, but no specific labels are provided for the regions.  
   - The "Tripel" (triple point) is marked at the intersection of the curves.
