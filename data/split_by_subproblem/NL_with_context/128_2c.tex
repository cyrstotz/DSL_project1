Exergy increase equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at state 6 and enthalpy at state 0 minus the surrounding temperature multiplied by the difference between entropy at state 6 and entropy at state 0, plus one-half multiplied by the difference between velocity squared at state 6 and velocity squared at state 0.
