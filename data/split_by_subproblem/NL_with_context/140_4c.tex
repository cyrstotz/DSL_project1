The equation is written as:  
s subscript u equals s subscript lambda.  

Below it, a specific value is given:  
s subscript u (8 bar) subscript g equals 0.9066 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Another equation is written:  
x subscript lambda equals (s subscript u minus s subscript f) divided by (s subscript g minus s subscript f).  

The term "subscript g" is circled.
