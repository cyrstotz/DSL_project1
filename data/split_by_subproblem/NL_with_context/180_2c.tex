Delta ex_str equals m dot multiplied by (u_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0) plus p_0 multiplied by (v_6 minus v_0)).  

Equals (T_6 minus T_0) multiplied by c_p minus T_0 multiplied by (c_p multiplied by ln(T_6 divided by T_0) minus R multiplied by ln(p_6 divided by p_3)) plus p_0 multiplied by (v_6 minus v_0) (from A-22).  

Equals 57.4 minus 82.00 plus p_0 multiplied by (v_6 minus v_0).  

v_G equals
