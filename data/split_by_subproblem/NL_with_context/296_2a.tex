A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 'S [kJ/kgÂ·K]'. The graph represents a thermodynamic process with labeled points and arrows indicating transitions between states:  
- Point 1 transitions to point 2, labeled as 'adiabatic reversible'.  
- Point 2 transitions to point 3, labeled as 'adiabatic reversible'.  
- Point 3 transitions to point 5, labeled as 'isobaric heat addition' at '0.5 bar'.  
- Point 5 transitions to point 6, labeled as 'adiabatic reversible'.  
- Point 6 transitions back to point 1, labeled as 'adiabatic reversible'.  
Additional annotations include 'm_K' and 'm_m' near points 2 and 3, respectively.
