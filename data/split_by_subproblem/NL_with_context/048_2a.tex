A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "n" and the x-axis labeled as "s". The graph shows several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left, labeled "0".  
- Point 1 above point 0, labeled "1".  
- Point 3 above point 1, labeled "3".  
- Point 5 to the right of point 3, labeled "5".  
- Point 6 below point 5, labeled "6".  
The curves are labeled as:  
- "adiabatic reversible" between points 0 and 1.  
- "adiabatic reversible" between points 3 and 5.  
- "0.5 isobar" between points 1 and 3.  
- "0.191 isobar" between points 5 and 6.
