The equation is written as:  
o = ṁ [h_e - h_a + (w_e squared - w_a squared) divided by 2] + Σ Q̇_s + Σ Ẇ_t  

Below this, the following equations are provided:  
T6 divided by T5 = (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n - 1) divided by n  
T0 = T5 (p0 divided by p5) raised to the power of (14 - 1) divided by 14 = 328.07 K  
p0 = p6 = 0.191 bar
