Delta exergy flow equals mass flow rate multiplied by the difference in enthalpy (h6 minus h0) minus T0 multiplied by the difference in entropy (s6 minus s0).  

Delta exergy flow equals mass flow rate multiplied by cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0) minus T0 multiplied by cp multiplied by (ln(T6 divided by T0)) minus R multiplied by (ln(p6 divided by p0)) plus (w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2).  

Delta exergy flow equals mass flow rate multiplied by (12.462 kilojoules per kilogram) plus 100.050 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 122.512 kilojoules per kilogram.
