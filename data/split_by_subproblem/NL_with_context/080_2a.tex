A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]'. The graph includes three isobars labeled as 'isobar 0 = p0', 'isobar 1 = p5', and 'isobar 2'. Points labeled '1', '2', '3', '5', and '6' are marked on the graph, connected by curves and lines. The region between points '5' and '6' is shaded.
