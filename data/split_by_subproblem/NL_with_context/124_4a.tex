A diagram is drawn with pressure (p in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled points:  
- Point 2 is marked on the left side of the diagram.  
- Point 7 is marked on the right side of the diagram.  
- A horizontal line connects points 2 and 7, labeled as "T_inlet".  
- The region between the points is shaded with a wavy pattern.
