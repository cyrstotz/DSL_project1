A graph is drawn labeled `a)` with axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled `s (kJ/kgÂ·K)`.  
- The y-axis is labeled `T (K)`.  

The graph shows a curve with points labeled `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`. Point `3` is at the peak, and there is a downward slope from `3` to `4`. A shaded region is drawn between points `4` and `5`.
