1. First Law of Thermodynamics (cooling jacket):  
Q equals m dot KF multiplied by (h KF in minus h KF out) plus Q out.  

1. First Law of Thermodynamics (reactor):  
Q equals m dot multiplied by (h e minus h a) plus Q out.  

Q out equals Q R minus m dot multiplied by (h e minus h a).  

h e equals h f at 70 degrees Celsius equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram (Table A2).  
h a equals h f at 100 degrees Celsius equals 419.06 kilojoules per kilogram (Table A2).  

Q out equals 62.4 kilowatts.
