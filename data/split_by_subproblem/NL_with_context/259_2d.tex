Exergy loss equals T zero times entropy production.  

Q equals m times (S e minus S a) plus Q B divided by T B plus integral S e to S z.  

S e z divided by m equals S a minus S e minus Q B divided by T B equals integral T two to T three (c p divided by T B times c p T) d T minus R times ln (p B divided by p two).  

Equals c p divided by T B times Q B divided by T B minus Q B divided by T B equals minus 1295.81 kilojoules per kelvin.  

Exergy loss equals 243.13 kelvin times minus 1295.81 kilojoules per kelvin equals minus 315076.20 kilojoules.
