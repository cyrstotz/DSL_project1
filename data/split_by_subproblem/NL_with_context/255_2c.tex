Delta exergy from 5 to 6 = h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0) plus w6 squared divided by 2  

h6 minus h0 = cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0) = 95.434 kilojoules per kilogram  

s6 minus s0 = cp multiplied by ln(T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by ln(p6 divided by p0) = 0.30376 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  

cv = cp divided by kappa = 7.15 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  

R = cp minus cv = 287.425 joules per kilogram Kelvin  

=> Delta exergy from 5 to 6 = -1.408705 joules per kilogram = 140.8 kilojoules per kilogram

2.45 Heat difference system:  

Delta S one two equals delta m two times s zero plus Q R divided by T plus S m.
