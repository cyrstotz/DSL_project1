A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points:  
- Point 2 is on a curve labeled "isotherpe."  
- Point 3 is above Point 2 and connected by a straight line labeled "isentrope."  
- The curve labeled "isotherpe" transitions into a region labeled "Nutzung."  
The axes are not numerically scaled, but the pressure axis includes a label "8 bar."
