Delta exergy str equals exergy str six minus exergy str zero.  
This equals h six minus h zero minus T zero multiplied by (s six minus s zero) plus kinetic energy.  
Kinetic energy equals w six squared divided by two minus w zero squared divided by two.  

This equals cp multiplied by (T six minus T zero) minus T zero multiplied by (cp multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T six divided by T zero) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p six divided by p zero)) plus w six squared divided by two minus w zero squared divided by two.  

The term R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p six divided by p zero) equals zero.
