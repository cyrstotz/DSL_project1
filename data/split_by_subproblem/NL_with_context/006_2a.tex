A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as \( T \) (K) and the x-axis labeled as \( s \) (kJ/kg). The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The curve connects these points, showing transitions between states. The isobar \( P_{23} \) is marked between points 2 and 3.
