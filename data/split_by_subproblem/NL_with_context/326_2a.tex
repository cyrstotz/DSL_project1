cp_L = 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  
kappa = 1.4  

A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 's [kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin]' and the y-axis labeled as 'T [Kelvin]'. The graph includes several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Point 1  
- Point 2  
- Point 3  
- Point 4  
- Point 5  
- Point 6  

The graph includes annotations:  
- 'isobar isobar'  
- 'adiabatic irreversible'  
- 'isobar isobar'
