Δex_str = ex_str,6 - ex_str,0 = h_6 - h_0 - T_0 (s_6 - s_0) + p_0 (v_6 - v_0)  

h_6 - h_0 = cp (T_6 - T_0) - T_0 (cp ln(T_6 divided by T_0)) + p_0 (v_6 - v_0)  

v_6 = R T_6 divided by p_0 = R divided by M_0 T_0 divided by p_0  

R = 310 K  

v_0 = R divided by M_0 T_0 divided by p_0 = 28.97 divided by 50 multiplied by 273.15 divided by 0.191 = 5.103 multiplied by 10 raised to the power of -3 m cubed divided by kg  

v_0 = 28.97 divided by 50 multiplied by 431.9 divided by 0.5 = 3.654 multiplied by 10 raised to the power of -3 m cubed divided by kg  

Δex_str = 1.006 multiplied by (310 - 273.15) - 273.15 multiplied by (1.006 ln(310 divided by 273.15) + 0.191 multiplied by (v_6 - v_0))  

Δex_str = 43.91 kJ divided by kg
