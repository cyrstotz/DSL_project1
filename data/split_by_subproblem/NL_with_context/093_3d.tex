Energy balance for EW:  
m times (u2 minus u1) plus Q12 equals 0 (no work as V equals constant, only heat transfer).  

u2 equals x2 times u(fest) plus x2 times u(rest) (u(fest) and u(rest) are specific internal energies).  
u1 equals u(fest) minus x1 times (u(fusion) minus u(fest)).  

u(rest) equals u(fest at 1 bar) plus (1.1 minus 1 bar) divided by (2 minus 1 bar) times (u(fest at 2 bar) minus u(fest at 1 bar)).
