A graph is drawn with pressure labeled as "p [bar]" on the vertical axis and temperature labeled as "T [K]" on the horizontal axis. The graph includes a curved line representing phase transitions.  

Below the graph, the following points are written:  
1-2: T increases, p increases  
2-3: s2 equals s3, p increases  
3-4: isobaric, T increases, p equals constant  
4-1: isenthalpic, h4 equals h1, p decreases, T equals constant  

Another graph is drawn below with the same axes labeled as "p [bar]" and "T [K]". This graph includes a cycle labeled with points 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- Between points 3 and 4, "p equals constant" is written.  
- Between points 1 and 2, "T equals constant" is written.
