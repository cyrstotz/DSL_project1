A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p(N/mÂ²)" and the x-axis labeled as "T(K)." The graph shows a curve resembling a phase diagram, with points marked along the curve. The curve starts low, rises to a peak labeled "i," and then decreases. The peak is connected to a horizontal arrow pointing to the right.

A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "T (K)" and the y-axis labeled as "p (mbar)." The graph shows multiple curves, including a steep upward curve followed by oscillations and a gradual decline. Two vertical lines are drawn on the left side of the graph, labeled "p_N" and "p_M."
