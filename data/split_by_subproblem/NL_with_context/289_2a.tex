A graph is drawn with the axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T [°C]" (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "S [kJ / kg·K]" (entropy).  

The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with several labeled points and curves:  
- Points are labeled as "0", "1", "3", "5", and "6".  
- Curves are labeled "isobar", "isentrop", and "isotherm".  
- The process transitions between states, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
- A dashed line marks "P0" (ambient pressure).
