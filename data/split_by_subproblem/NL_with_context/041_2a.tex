A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T (K)" for temperature.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "S (kJ/kgÂ·K)" for entropy.  

The diagram includes the following labeled points and processes:  
- Point "0" at the origin.  
- Point "1" connected to "0" via an isobar labeled "isobaric rex".  
- Point "2" connected to "1" via an adiabatic process labeled "adiabat".  
- Point "3" connected to "2" via an isobar labeled "isobar".  
- Point "S" connected to "3" via an isentropic process labeled "isentrop".  
- Point "6" connected to "S" via an adiabatic process labeled "adiabat".  
- The pressure values are marked: "p = 0.5 bar" and "p0 = 0.191 bar".  
- The flows "mM" and "mK" are indicated in the diagram.
