Steady flow process:  
O equals m dot times (h sub 5 minus h sub 6 plus w sub 5 squared divided by 2 minus w sub 6 squared divided by 2) plus Q minus W.  

O equals m dot core times (h sub 5 minus h sub 6 plus w sub 5 squared divided by 2 minus w sub 6 squared divided by 2).  

h sub 5 minus h sub 6 equals (T sub 5 minus T sub 6) times c sub p.  

T sub 6 equals T sub 5 times (p sub 0 divided by p sub 5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

T sub 6 equals 328.07 Kelvin.  

m dot mantle equals m dot core plus m dot mantle.  

m dot mantle divided by m dot core equals 5.293.  

q sub B divided by m dot core equals 1195 kilojoules per kilogram.  

T sub B equals 1289 Kelvin.  

T sub 1 equals T sub 0 times (p sub 1 divided by p sub 0) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

T sub 1 equals 320.059 Kelvin.  

O equals m dot core times c sub p times (T sub 5 minus T sub 6).  

m dot mantle times h sub 1 plus m dot core times h sub 5 minus m dot core times h sub 6 plus w sub 5 squared divided by 2 minus w sub 6 squared divided by 2 equals W sub G divided by 2.  

Answer:  
w sub 6 squared equals 2 times (h sub 5 minus h sub 6) plus w sub 5 squared.  

w sub 6 equals square root of (2 times (h sub 5 minus h sub 6) plus w sub 5 squared).  

w sub 6 equals square root of (2 times c sub p times (T sub 5 minus T sub 6) plus w sub 5 squared).  

w sub 6 equals 220.474 meters per second.
