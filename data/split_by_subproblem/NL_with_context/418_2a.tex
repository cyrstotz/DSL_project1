A T-s diagram is drawn with the temperature (T) on the vertical axis in Kelvin [K] and entropy (s) on the horizontal axis in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin [kJ/kgÂ·K]. The diagram includes labeled isobars and process paths:  
- Point 0 is marked at the bottom left, with the label \( p_0 = p_6 \).  
- Point 1 is connected to Point 2 via an isobar labeled \( p_2 = p_3 \).  
- Point 2 connects to Point 3 via an isentropic path labeled \( n_{is} < 1 \).  
- Point 3 connects to Point 4 via an isobar labeled \( p_3 \).  
- Point 4 connects to Point 5 via another isobar labeled \( p_5 \).  
- Point 5 connects back to Point 0 via an isentropic path.
