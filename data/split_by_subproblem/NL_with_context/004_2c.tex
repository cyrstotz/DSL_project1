Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream at state 6 minus exergy stream at state 0.  
Delta exergy stream equals (h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0)) plus ke6 minus ke0.  

Using the Stoff model:  
h6 minus h0 equals cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0) equals 97.43 kilojoules per kilogram.  
s6 minus s0 equals cp multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T6 divided by T0) minus n multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p6 divided by p0) equals 0.3372786.  
ke6 equals velocity squared at state 6 divided by 2 equals 130.05 kilojoules per kilogram.  
ke0 equals velocity squared at state 0 divided by 2 equals 20.  

Delta exergy stream equals 125.417 kilojoules per kilogram.
