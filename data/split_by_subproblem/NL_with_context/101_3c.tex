T one equals seven hundred seventy-three point one five kelvin.  
T gas two equals zero point zero zero three degrees Celsius equals two hundred seventy-three point one five three kelvin.  

Q one two equals Cv equals zero point six three three kilojoules per kilogram kelvin.  

Cv times m times delta T equals Q one two equals zero point six three three kilojoules per kilogram kelvin times two point eight times ten to the power of negative three kilograms times seven hundred seventy-three point one four seven kelvin equals one point three seven five kilojoules equals Q one two.

Zero equals m total multiplied by the quantity h one minus h zero minus T zero multiplied by the quantity s one minus s zero, equals zero.
