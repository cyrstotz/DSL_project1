A graph is drawn with the title "T [K]" on the vertical axis and "S [kJ/K]" on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a thermodynamic process with labeled points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 connected by lines. The following labels are included:  
- \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( T_0 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( p_z = p_3 \)  
- \( s_1 = s_2 \)  
- \( s_3 = s_5 \)  
- \( p_1 = p_4 = p_5 \)  
- \( p_6 = p_0 \)  
- \( s_5 = s_6 \)  
Pressure values are marked as \( 0.5 \, \text{BAR} \) and \( 0.191 \, \text{BAR} \).
