The following equations and notes are written:  
- "p0 = pC"  
- "stat. FP um Schnittstelle: 0 = ṁ (h5 - h6) + Q̇ - Ẇ"  
- "Ẇ = ṁ (h5 - h6)"  
- "h5 (0.5 bar) 431.9 K = interpolieren in TAB-A2Z"  
- "interpolieren für x1 = 430 K, x2 = 440 K, in TAB-A2Z"  

Below this, the following calculations are written:  
- "ṁges = ṁM + ṁK"  
- "ṁM = 5.293 ṁK"  
- "ṁges = 6.293 ṁK"
