A graph is drawn with the temperature (T) in Kelvin (K) on the vertical axis and entropy (S) on the horizontal axis. The horizontal axis is labeled with "kJ/kgK". The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The curve shows transitions between these points, including a zigzag section between points 4 and 5.
