Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by exergy of the stream at state 0 minus exergy of the stream at state 6 plus (1 minus T subscript 0 divided by T subscript B) multiplied by Q subscript B minus W subscript t minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals exergy of the stream at state 0 minus exergy of the stream at state 6 plus (1 minus T subscript 0 divided by T subscript B) multiplied by Q subscript B.  
Exergy loss equals 849.335 kilojoules per kilogram.
