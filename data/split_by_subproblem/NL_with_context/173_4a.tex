A graph is drawn with pressure (p) in bar on the vertical axis and temperature (T) in kilojoules on the horizontal axis. The graph includes a dome-shaped curve labeled with points 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left of the curve.  
- Point 2 is at the bottom right of the curve.  
- Point 3 is at the top of the curve.  
- Point 4 is on the left side of the curve, near the peak.  
The graph is labeled with \( p_1 = 1 \, \text{bar} \) and \( T_i = -10^\circ \text{C} \).
