The following equations and calculations are written:  

"Gas: w6, T6  
0 = m dot g5 [h5 - h6 + (w5 squared - w6 squared) divided by 2] + Q dot SG + W dot SG  
0 = m dot g5 [h0 - h6 + (w0 squared - w6 squared) divided by 2] + Q dot SG + W dot SG  
h0 - h6 = Cp (T0 - T6)  

T6 divided by T5 = (p0 divided by p5) raised to the power of (x minus 1 divided by x)  
=> T6 = T5 (p0 divided by p5) raised to the power of (x minus 1 divided by x) = 431.51 K (0.191 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4) = 325.07 K = T6  

=> Cp (T0 - T6) + (w0 squared - w6 squared) divided by 2 = 0  

=> 2 Cp (T0 - T6) - w0 squared = -w6 squared  

=> w0 squared = w6 squared + 2 Cp (T0 - T6)  

=> w0 = square root of [w6 squared + 2 Cp (T0 - T6)]  

=> w0 = square root of [200 squared minus 2 times 1.006 times (243.15 minus 325.07)] = 453.19 meters per second."  

The final result "453.19 meters per second" is underlined.

0 equals m_ges multiplied by [Delta ex_str] minus E_x_ver.  

0 equals [Delta ex_str] minus E_x_ver divided by m_ges.  

E_x_ver equals 122.2 kilojoules per kilogram.
