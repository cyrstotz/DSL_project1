Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream six minus exergy stream zero.  

Delta exergy stream equals h six minus h zero minus T zero multiplied by (s six minus s zero) plus kinetic energy.  

Kinetic energy equals h six minus h zero minus T zero multiplied by (s six minus s zero) plus kinetic energy.  

Equals c p multiplied by (T six minus T zero) minus T zero multiplied by (s six minus s zero) plus w six squared divided by two.  

T zero equals 293 Kelvin.  
T six equals 328.07 Kelvin.  

s six minus s zero equals integral from T zero to T two of c p divided by T dT minus R multiplied by ln (p six divided by p zero).  

Equals c p multiplied by ln (T six divided by T zero) minus R multiplied by ln (p six divided by p zero).  

ln (p six divided by p zero) equals zero.  

R equals c p minus c v equals c p multiplied by c p divided by kappa equals 0.2874.  

c v equals c p divided by kappa.  

Therefore s six minus s zero equals 6.302.  

Delta exergy stream equals 1.006 multiplied by (328.07 minus 293) minus 293 multiplied by 0.302 plus 220 squared divided by two.  

Equals 26576.037 joules per kilogram.
