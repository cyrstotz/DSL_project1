A graph is drawn with the axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  

The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with six states labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- State 0 is at the origin.  
- States 1 to 6 are connected by lines representing different processes.  
- The following isobars are labeled:  
  - "Isobare p2 = p3" (isobaric process at pressure p2 equals p3).  
  - "Isobare p4 = p5" (isobaric process at pressure p4 equals p5).  
  - "Isobare p0" (isobaric process at pressure p0).
