\( T_{\text{g,2}} = T_{\text{EW,1}} \)  
\( = 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

Explanation:  
- The ice-water mixture does not change its temperature due to the heat flow, as it is already in the solid-liquid region.  
- Isothermal process.  
- In equilibrium, the gas and ice have the same temperature.  

A scribbled-out section is present.  

The equation:  
\( p_{\text{a2}} = p_{\text{a1}} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \).  

Additional explanation:  
The pressure remains constant because nothing changes in the force equilibrium, only heat was transferred (see Task 2).
