Q out equals 65 kilowatts, T KF equals 295 Kelvin  

0 equals m dot multiplied by [S e minus S a] plus Q out divided by T Reactor plus S dot erz  
Balance in reactor  

S dot erz equals m dot multiplied by [S a minus S e] minus Q out divided by T Reactor  

S a equals 1.3 multiplied by 69 plus 0.005 multiplied by (7.35 multiplied by 69 minus 1.3069) equals 1.34 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  

S e equals 0.9569 plus 0.005 multiplied by (7.7553 minus 0.9569) equals 0.99 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  

S dot erz equals 0.3 multiplied by [1.34 minus 0.99] minus 65 kilowatts divided by 373.15 Kelvin equals 0.22 kilowatts per kilogram Kelvin
