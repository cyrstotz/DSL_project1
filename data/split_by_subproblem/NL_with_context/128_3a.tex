A diagram is drawn showing a membrane separating two chambers. The upper chamber is labeled "m_EW" and the lower chamber is labeled "Gas". The pressure in the lower chamber is labeled as "p_g".  

Equations:  
m_g plus p_0 times A_t plus m_EW times g equals p_g times A.  

g divided by A times (m_K plus m_EW) plus p_0 equals p_g.  

3.81 divided by 0.005 times (32 kilograms plus 0.1 kilograms) plus 1 bar equals 1.9 bar equals p_g.  

Further calculations:  
p_g times V_g,1 equals R divided by M_g times m_g times T_g,1.  

m_g equals p_g times V_g,1 divided by R divided by M_g times T_g,1.  

Substituting values:  
1.9 bar times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 8.314 cubic meters times kilopascal divided by kilomole times kelvin divided by 773 kelvin times 50 kilograms per kilomole equals 3.42 kilograms equals m_g.
