A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled axes: pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in degrees Celsius) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes the following elements:  
- A solid-liquid equilibrium line labeled "Schritt i â†’ ii".  
- A region labeled "Fett" (solid phase).  
- A region labeled "Gas" (gas phase).  
- A point labeled "Tripel" (triple point).  
- A horizontal line labeled "Ti" (freeze dryer temperature).  
- A vertical dashed line labeled "FL (5 mbar)" (freeze dryer pressure).  
- An annotation stating "Wasser kann hier sublimieren" (water can sublimate here).
