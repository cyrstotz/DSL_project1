Energy balance:  
State 1: \( T_{Reactor,1} = 100^\circ \text{C} \),  
State 2: \( T_{Reactor,2} = 70^\circ \text{C} \),  
\( T_{in,12} = 20^\circ \text{C} \),  
\( Q_{aus,12} = 35 \cdot 10^3 \, \text{kJ} \).  

Diagram:  
A rectangle is drawn representing the reactor system, with \( Q_{aus,12} \) labeled as heat flow.  

Problem: Closed system.  
Equation:  
\( \Delta S = m_2 \cdot s_2 - m_1 \cdot s_1 = \Delta m_{12} \cdot s_{in,12} + Q_{aus} - \sum \dot{m} \cdot s_{out} = 0 \).  
\( m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m_{12} \).
