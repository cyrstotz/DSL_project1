A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]".  
- The y-axis is labeled as "T [K]".  

The diagram shows six points connected by curves and arrows, representing the process flow:  
- Point 1 transitions to Point 2.  
- Point 2 transitions to Point 3.  
- Point 3 transitions to Point 4.  
- Point 4 transitions to Point 5.  
- Point 5 transitions to Point 6.  

The pressure values are labeled:  
- At Point 5: "0.5 bar".  
- At Point 6: "0.191 bar".
