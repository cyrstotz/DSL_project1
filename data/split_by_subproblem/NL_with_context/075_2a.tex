A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The diagram includes curves and lines representing processes such as isobaric and isentropic changes. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- Horizontal axis: "S [kJ/kg·K]"  
- Vertical axis: "T [K]"  

The following annotations are present:  
- Between points 2 and 3: "isentrop"  
- Between points 3 and 4: "isobar"  
- Between points 5 and 6: "isentrop sentrop?"  

An inequality is written:  
"η_V,s = (T_2s - T_0) / (T_2 - T_0) < 1."  

A conclusion is drawn:  
"v_2s > v_2."
