Delta exergy stream equals zero equals delta exergy work minus delta exergy surroundings.  

Delta exergy stream equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus temperature at surroundings multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0)) minus mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 4 minus enthalpy at state 0 minus temperature at surroundings multiplied by (entropy at state 4 minus entropy at state 0)).  

Delta exergy stream equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 4 minus temperature at surroundings multiplied by entropy at state 6 plus temperature at surroundings multiplied by entropy at state 0 minus temperature at surroundings multiplied by entropy at state 4).  

Delta exergy stream equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 6 minus enthalpy at state 4 minus temperature at surroundings multiplied by (entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 4)) plus kinetic energy at state 6 minus kinetic energy at state 4.  

Delta exergy stream equals mass flow rate multiplied by (specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at state 6 minus temperature at state 4) minus temperature at surroundings multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state 6 divided by temperature at state 4)) minus pressure divided by density plus kinetic energy at state 6 minus kinetic energy at state 4.  

Delta exergy stream divided by mass flow rate equals delta exergy mass-specific.  

Delta exergy equals 1.006 multiplied by (340 Kelvin minus 253.15 Kelvin) minus (301,273.5) minus 1.006 multiplied by the natural logarithm of (340 Kelvin divided by 253.15 Kelvin) plus (700 squared divided by 2 minus 510 squared divided by 2).  

Delta exergy equals negative 110,034.7796 Joules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy equals negative 110,034 kilojoules per kilogram.
