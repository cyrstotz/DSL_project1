Given values:  
- \( w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( T_5 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  

Equation:  
\( O = \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} \left( h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2} \right) - \dot{W}_{\text{rev}} \)  

Entropy relation:  
\( S_5 = S_6 \, \text{(weil isentrop)} \)  

Temperature calculation:  
\( \frac{T_6}{T_5} = \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \)  
\( T_6 = T_5 \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \)  
\( T_6 = 431.9 \left( \frac{0.191}{0.5} \right)^{\frac{1.4-1}{1.4}} = 328.075 \, \text{K} \)  

Final result: \( T_6 = 328.075 \, \text{K} \).

O equals m specific times c p specific times open parenthesis T five minus T six close parenthesis plus m specific times w six squared divided by two minus m specific times w five squared divided by two.  

w specific equals square root of two times c p specific times open parenthesis T six minus T zero close parenthesis minus w zero squared divided by n equals seventy-four point six zero six.  

R equals c p divided by c v equals c p minus c v divided by n equals zero point two eight five four times w specific divided by c v.  

w six equals square root of two times c p times open parenthesis T five minus T six close parenthesis plus w five squared divided by two equals five hundred seven point two four three meters per second.
