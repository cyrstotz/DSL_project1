Delta U equals Q minus W, where W equals zero (the system is isolated).  
U times (u2 minus u1) equals Q.  
u2 equals u1.  

Q divided by m equals Delta u times (0.003) plus x2 times (uIce minus uL) equals u times (0.003).  

Q divided by m equals -200.1 minus uL times (0.003) minus x2 times (uIce minus uL).  

Q divided by m equals -200.1 minus uL times (0.003) divided by minus (uIce minus uL times (0.003)).  

Therefore, x2 equals -200.1 minus uL times (0.003) divided by minus (uIce minus uL times (0.003)).  

uIce times (0.003) equals -0.033.  
uL times (0.003) equals -0.33346427.  

Therefore, x2 equals 0.5696.  
Therefore, x2 equals 56.96 percent.
