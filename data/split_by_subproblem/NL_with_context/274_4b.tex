Energy balance equation:  
Q = mR123 [h2 - h3] + Wk  

Work equation:  
Wk = mR123 = 0.721 kilograms per second  

Enthalpy difference:  
h2 - h3  

Calculation:  
mR123 = 0.721 kilograms per second  

h3 = (h5 + h4) - (h5 + h3)  
= (0.2358 - 0.0906)  
= 0.0066 - 0.9394  

p3 = 8 bar  

State 2:  
S2 = S3  
S2 = Sg from T2  
Table A10  

h2 = hg from Table A10  
T2 = (-22Â°C)  

S2 = 61.9351 = S3  

h3 = 72.94
