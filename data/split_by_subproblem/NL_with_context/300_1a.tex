a) The temperature does not need to increase during a steady flow process.  

Q equals m in times (h in minus h out) plus Q R plus Q aus.  

Q aus equals m in times (h out minus h in) minus Q R.  

Boiling liquid is assumed to be pure water.  

h out equals h fg at 100 degrees Celsius equals 2257.0 kilojoules per kilogram (from water tables A-2).  

m in equals 0.3 kilograms per second.  

h in equals h fg at 70 degrees Celsius equals 2333.8 kilojoules per kilogram (from water tables A-2).  

Q R equals 100 kilowatts.  

Q aus equals negative 123.04 kilowatts.
