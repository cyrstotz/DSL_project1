Thermodynamic mean temperature calculation:  
T mean equals integral of T ds divided by s a minus s e, which equals h a minus h e divided by s a minus s e.  

Ideal and constant:  
T mean equals (298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin) divided by natural logarithm of (298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin), resulting in 293.12 Kelvin.
