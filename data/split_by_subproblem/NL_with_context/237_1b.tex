S_dot_erz plus mass flow rate times (s_e minus s_a) plus summation of Q divided by T equals 0.  
S_dot_erz equals 0.  

Q_out divided by T equals mass flow rate times (s_e minus s_a).  
T_bar equals c times (T_2 minus T_1) equals Q_out divided by ln(T_2 divided by T_1).  
T_bar equals 293.12 Kelvin.
