The mass flow rate of refrigerant in the cooling cycle is discussed.  
- A statement reads: "Wi = 28 W, um die dampf ordentlich verdampft auf 85 s zu bringen." (Wi = 28 W to properly evaporate the vapor in 85 seconds).  
- A condition is given: "ZSU: voll kondensator p = 8 bar" (ZSU: fully condensed, p = 8 bar).  
- A process from state 1 to state 2 is described as "isoc Wärmeinhalt" (isoc heat content).  
- An equation is partially written: "E-Sbilanz: dE/dt = mR134a (he-ha) + Qas".  
- Another equation is written: "mR134a = -Qas / (h2-h1)".  
- Additional terms are crossed out but include references to "Qas", "Wi", and enthalpy differences.  
- Specific enthalpy values are mentioned:  
  - "h3 = h(8 bar)"  
  - "h4 = h(sat.fl, 8 bar)"  
- A pressure difference is noted: "p3-p1, die kühlen hier wieder" (p3-p1, they cool here again).
