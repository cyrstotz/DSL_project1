p times V equals m times R times T.  

Force equilibrium on membrane:  
Area equals pi times 0.05 meters squared equals 3.926 times 10 to the power of negative 2 square meters.  
Force equals mass times gravity (32 kilograms times 10 meters per second squared). Force equals 311.90 Newtons.  

Pressure at state 1 equals pressure ambient plus delta pressure from force divided by area.  
Pressure at state 1 equals 1 bar plus 1.500 bar.  

p times V divided by R times T equals m.  

p equals 1.7 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascal.  
Volume equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.  
R equals 4.16 times 10 to the power of negative 2 joules per kilogram Kelvin.  
Temperature equals 773.15 Kelvin.  
Mass equals 166.28 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms.
