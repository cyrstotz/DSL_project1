A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as \( p \) [bar] on the vertical axis and \( T \) [Â°C] on the horizontal axis. The curve represents the phase boundary, with a point labeled "Trippel" (triple point). Two processes are marked: "isotherm" (horizontal line) and "isobar" (vertical line), connecting states labeled as "1" and "2."
