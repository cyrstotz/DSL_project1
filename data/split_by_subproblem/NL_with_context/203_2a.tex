A diagram is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kgÂ·K]' and the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The diagram shows a thermodynamic process with labeled points:  
- Point 0: Isentrop  
- Point 1: Adiabat  
- Point 2: Isobar  
- Point 3: Isobar  
- Point 4: Adiabat  
- Point 5: Isobar  
- Point 6: Isentrop
