A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the y-axis labeled in bar and temperature (T) on the x-axis labeled in Kelvin. The graph includes the following:  
- A curve labeled "Fest" (solid phase).  
- A curve labeled "Flüssig" (liquid phase).  
- A curve labeled "Flüssig Gas" (liquid-gas phase).  
- A point labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point).  
- An isothermal expansion labeled "Isotherme Expansion" at 0.5 bar.  
- A temperature difference labeled "ΔT = 10K".  
- A process path labeled "Isobare Abkühlung" (isobaric cooling).
