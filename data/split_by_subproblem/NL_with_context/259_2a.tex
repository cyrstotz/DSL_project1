A graph is drawn with labeled axes. The x-axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature), and the y-axis is labeled as 'S' (entropy) with units [kJ/kgÂ·K]. The graph includes several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Points: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  
- Isobars: p2 = p3, p4, p5, pm, p0 = p6  
- A region labeled as 'richtlinie' (guideline).
