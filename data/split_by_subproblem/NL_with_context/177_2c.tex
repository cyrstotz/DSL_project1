Delta ex_str equals (h6 minus h0) minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0).  
Delta ex_str equals cp_air multiplied by (T6 minus T0) minus T0 multiplied by (cp_air multiplied by ln(T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by ln(p6 divided by p0)).  
R equals 287 Joules divided by kilogram Kelvin.  
Delta ex_str equals 1.006 kilojoules divided by kilogram Kelvin multiplied by (328 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin) minus 243.15 Kelvin multiplied by (1.006 kilojoules divided by kilogram Kelvin multiplied by ln(328 Kelvin divided by 243.15 Kelvin) minus 287 Joules divided by kilogram Kelvin multiplied by ln(p6 divided by p0)).  
Delta ex_str equals 12.74 kilojoules divided by kilogram.
