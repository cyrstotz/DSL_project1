Delta exergy of the stream equals exergy of the stream at state 6 minus exergy of the stream at state 0.  
Delta exergy of the stream equals h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 minus T subscript 0 multiplied by (s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0) plus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 minus w subscript Luft squared divided by 2.  

h subscript 6 minus h subscript 0 equals c subscript p Luft multiplied by (T subscript 6 minus T subscript 0) equals 85.84434 kilojoules per kilogram.  

s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0 equals c subscript p multiplied by ln (T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 0) minus R multiplied by ln (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 0).  
p subscript 6 equals p subscript 0.  
s subscript 6 minus s subscript 0 equals 0.30136 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Delta exergy of the stream equals exergy of the stream at state 6 minus exergy of the stream at state 0 equals 120.247 kilojoules per kilogram.
