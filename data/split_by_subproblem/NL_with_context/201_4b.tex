General system equation for mass flow rate of R134a:  
0 equals mass flow rate of R134a times (enthalpy at state 3 minus enthalpy at state 2) plus heat flow rate.  

Rewritten:  
0 equals mass flow rate of R134a times (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 3) minus work rate.  
This implies:  
Mass flow rate of R134a equals work rate divided by (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 3).  

Further notes:  
Enthalpy at state 2 equals enthalpy of saturated vapor (hg).  
Entropy at state 2 equals entropy at state 3.  

Enthalpy at state 3 is determined using pressure of 8 bar and temperature at state 3.
