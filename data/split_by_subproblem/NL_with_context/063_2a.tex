A graph is drawn with temperature (T in Kelvin) on the vertical axis and entropy (S in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with labeled points: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The process includes isobars and curves, with annotations indicating constant pressure (P = const).  

Below the graph, the following values are listed:  
- P = 0.191  
- T = -30
