Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. Diagram labeled `(i)`:
   - The axes are labeled as `p` (pressure) on the vertical axis and `T` (temperature) on the horizontal axis.  
   - A curve is drawn representing the phase regions, with points labeled `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.  
   - Between points `1` and `2`, the process is labeled as "isobar".  
   - Between points `2` and `3`, the process is labeled as "adiabat reversible".  
   - Between points `3` and `4`, the process is labeled as "isobar".  
   - Between points `4` and `1`, the process is labeled as "adiabat reversible".  
   - The region under the curve is labeled as `NS`.  

2. Diagram labeled `(ii)`:
   - The axes are labeled as `p` (pressure) on the vertical axis and `T` (temperature) on the horizontal axis.  
   - A curve is drawn representing the phase regions, with a point labeled `2` at the peak of the curve.  
   - The process at point `2` is labeled as "isotherm".  
   - A vertical line is drawn from point `2` upward, labeled as "Triple point".  
   - The region under the curve is labeled as `NS`.
