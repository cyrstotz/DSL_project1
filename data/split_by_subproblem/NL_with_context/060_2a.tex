T-s diagram: Rocket side!  
[Two diagrams are drawn. The first diagram shows a curved path labeled with T and s axes. The second diagram has intersecting lines and arrows, also labeled with T and s axes.]

---

A diagram is drawn with labeled axes. The vertical axis represents temperature, and the horizontal axis represents entropy. The diagram includes curves and arrows indicating processes.  

- Two isobaric processes are labeled "isobar."  
- The temperature T_6 is greater than T_5.  
- The diagram includes dashed lines and arrows indicating transitions between states.
