A = pi times D squared divided by 4 = 25 pi = 78.54 square centimeters  
= pi times 0.1 squared divided by 4 = 0.00785 cubic meters  

P_g,1 = P_amb plus m_K divided by A times g plus m_EW divided by A times g  
= 10^5 pascals plus (9.806 meters per second squared)  
= 140078.09 pascals  
= 1.4 bar  

V_g,1 = v_g times m_g  

m = P times V divided by R times T  
= 140000 times V_1 divided by R times T_g,1  
= 0.003432 kilograms = 3.4 grams  

R = c_V times (kappa minus 1) = R divided by M  
= 8.314 joules per mole kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole  
= 166.28  

V_g = 3.14 liters = 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters  
T_g,1 = 500 plus 273.15
