\( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \), \( p_{g,2} = 0.495 \, \text{bar} \)  

Since ice is still present, \( T_{\text{EW}} \) must equal \( 0^\circ \text{C} \), because thermodynamic equilibrium exists. Therefore, \( T_{g,2} \) and \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) must be reached. The pressure can thus be calculated.
