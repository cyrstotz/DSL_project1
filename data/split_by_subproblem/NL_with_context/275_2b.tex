The equation for velocity \( w_6 \) is written as:  
\( w_6 = \sqrt{\frac{w_5^2}{2} - (h_6 - h_5)} \)  
\( w_6 = 507.25 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \)  

The temperature \( T_B \) is calculated as:  
\( T_B = T_5 \left( \frac{p_0}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{k-1}{k}} = 328.07 \, \text{K} \)  

The energy balance equation is written as:  
\( \frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{m}_{\text{gas}} (h_5 - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2}{2} - \frac{w_6^2}{2}) + \dot{Q} - \dot{X} = 0 \)  

\( h_6 - h_5 = c_p \Delta T \)
