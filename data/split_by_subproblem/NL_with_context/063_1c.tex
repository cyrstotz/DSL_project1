Entropy production \( S_{erz} \):  
\( S_{erz} = \frac{Q_{out}}{T} - \frac{Q_{out}}{T} + S_{erz} \)  
\( S_{erz} = \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{273.15 \, \text{K}} - \frac{65 \, \text{kW}}{373.15 \, \text{K}} \)  
\( S_{erz} = 97.5 \, \text{kg/K} \)  

A diagram is drawn showing a rectangular box labeled \( T \) and \( Q \), with arrows indicating heat transfer \( Q \) of 100 kW.
