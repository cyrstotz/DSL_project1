Pg2 equals Pg1 equals 1.4008 bar.  
Tg2 equals TEW2 equals 0°C.  

In state 2: no more heat transfer occurs.  
xIce2 is greater than 0, therefore Tg2 equals 0°C.  

As there is still ice in the EW, the temperature remains at 0°C.  
The pressure does not change in the gas because the substances remain constant.  
The temperature of the gas matches the temperature of the water since no heat exchange occurs in state 2.
