p 2 equals p 1 times T 2 divided by T 1.  

T 2 divided by T 1 equals p 2 divided by p 1 to the power of n minus 1 divided by n.  

n equals C P divided by C V equals C P divided by C P minus R divided by M.  
C P equals 0.79928.  

n equals 0.79928 divided by 0.633 equals 1.263.  

p 2 divided by p 1 equals T 2 divided by T 1 to the power of n minus 1 divided by n equals 0.265 divided by 0.265 equals 0.3799 bar.  

p 2 equals 9.97 times 10 to the power of minus 3 bar.

Q twelve equals W twelve.  
Q twelve equals integral from one to two of p dV equals R times (T two minus T one) divided by one minus n.  
Q twelve equals R times (T two minus T one) divided by one minus n equals zero point four six six two eight times (seven hundred seventy-three point one five minus two hundred seventy-three point four five) divided by one minus one point two six three.  

Equals eight point three four one times (seven hundred seventy-three point one five minus two hundred seventy-three point four five) times ten to the power of three divided by one minus one point two six three.  

Arrow indicates recalculation of R.  
Arrow indicates Q twelve equals minus one thousand five hundred eighty point six five joules.
