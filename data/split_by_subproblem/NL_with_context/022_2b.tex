Graph:  
A T-s diagram is drawn with temperature (T) in Kelvin on the x-axis and entropy (s) in kJ/kgÂ·K on the y-axis.  

The process is labeled with points 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6.  
- Point 0 is the starting state.  
- Points 2, 3, 5, and 6 are connected with arrows indicating the process flow.  
- Isobaric and isothermal lines are marked.  

The diagram includes a closed loop representing the jet engine cycle.
