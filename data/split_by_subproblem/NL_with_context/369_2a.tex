A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_5 \), and \( p_B \). The diagram includes points labeled \( 0 \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \), connected by arrows indicating the process flow. The y-axis is labeled \( T \) [K], and the x-axis is labeled \( s \) [kJ/kgÂ·K].
