An equation is written:  
T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n).  

Substituting values:  
T6 equals T5 multiplied by (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 0.1 divided by 1.4.  

T6 equals 431.9 multiplied by the above expression, resulting in 328.07 K.  

Additional equations are written:  
w dot equals m dot multiplied by (u5 minus uc plus (w5 squared minus w2 squared divided by 2)).  

Crossed-out content follows, then:  
w6 squared equals 2 multiplied by (h5 minus h6) minus (w5 squared divided by 2).  

Final equation:  
w6 squared equals 2 multiplied by (u5 minus u6) plus w5 squared.
