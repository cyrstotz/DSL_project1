A diagram is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled regions:  
- "flüssig" (liquid) at the top left.  
- "gasförmig" (gaseous) at the bottom right.  
- A line labeled "5 mbar" horizontally near the bottom.  
- A vertical line labeled "T_i" at the leftmost part of the diagram.  
- A horizontal arrow labeled "10K" pointing to the right.  
Two steps are marked:  
- "(i)" near the top of the diagram, indicating a process moving horizontally.  
- "(ii)" near the bottom of the diagram, indicating a process moving vertically.
