A diagram is drawn representing a T-s (temperature-entropy) process. The diagram includes labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 above point 0.  
- Point 2 to the right of point 1.  
- Point 3 above point 2, labeled with "P2".  
- Point 4 to the right of point 3, labeled with "P5".  
- Point 5 below point 4.  
- Point 6 below point 5, near the bottom right, labeled "P0".  

The curve between points 3 and 4 is labeled "isobare".  
The horizontal axis is labeled "S" (entropy), and the vertical axis is labeled "h" (enthalpy) in kilojoules per kilogram (kJ/kg).
