Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream at state 6 minus exergy stream at state 0.  

T6 equals 790 degrees Celsius.  
T0 equals 50 degrees Celsius.  

Delta exergy stream equals [h6 minus h0 minus T0 multiplied by (s6 minus s0) plus Delta ice].  

h6 minus h0 equals cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0).  
s6 minus s0 equals cp multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p6 divided by p0).  

Delta ice equals w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

R equals universal gas constant divided by molar mass.  
R equals 8.314 divided by 28.57 multiplied by 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms per mole.  
R equals 0.290 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Delta exergy stream equals [cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0) minus T0 multiplied by (cp multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of (p6 divided by p0)) plus (w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2)].  

Equals 125.47773 kilojoules per kilogram.
