T mean equals integral from s a to s e of T ds divided by s a minus s e.  

Integral ds equals dQ divided by T.  

Negative integral dQ divided by s a minus s e equals q a minus q e divided by s a minus s e equals u a minus u e divided by s a minus s e.  

Equals c p times (T a minus T e) divided by c p times ln of (T a divided by T e).  

Equals 293.12 Kelvin.
