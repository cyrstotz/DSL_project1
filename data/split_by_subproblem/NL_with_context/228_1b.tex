T bar equals s2 minus s1 divided by h2 minus h1 equals delta h divided by delta s equals h2 minus h1 divided by s2 minus s1.  

h2 and h1 are from above.  

sF (288.15 K) equals 0.2245 kJ/kg·K.  
sF (298.15 K) equals 0.3624 kJ/kg·K.  

T bar equals (0.2245 minus 0.3624) divided by (104.83 minus 62.83) equals 253.2 K.
