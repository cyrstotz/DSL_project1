Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals temperature at state 0 multiplied by entropy production.  

Entropy production equals mass flow rate multiplied by entropy at state 2 minus entropy at state 1 equals mass flow rate multiplied by the natural logarithm of temperature at state 2 divided by temperature at state 1 multiplied by specific heat capacity.  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals temperature at state 0 multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of temperature at state 2 divided by temperature at state 0 equals two hundred eighty-three point one five Kelvin multiplied by one point zero zero six kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by the natural logarithm of three hundred forty Kelvin divided by two hundred eighty-three point one five Kelvin.  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals eighty-two point zero one kilojoules per kilogram.
