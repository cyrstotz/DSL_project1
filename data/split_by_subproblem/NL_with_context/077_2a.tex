A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the vertical axis and entropy (s) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The following features are marked:  
- Isobar lines labeled \( p > p_0 \) and \( p_0 \).  
- An isotherm line labeled "-30°C".  
- An isentropic line labeled "isentrop".  

The transitions between points are described as follows:  
(1 → 2) Isentropic, entropy constant, pressure decreases.  
(2 → 3) Isobaric, pressure constant, temperature increases.  
(3 → 4) Not isentropic.  
(4 → 5) Isobaric, pressure constant.  
(5 → 6) Isentropic, entropy constant.  

A smaller diagram is drawn in the corner, showing a cycle labeled with points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
