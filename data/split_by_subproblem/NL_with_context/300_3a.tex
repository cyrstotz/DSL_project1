A equals pi times r squared equals pi times d squared divided by four equals seven point eighty-five times ten to the power of negative three cubic meters.  

p_g1 times A equals m_EW times g plus thirty-two times g plus p_amb times A.  

p_g1 equals m_EW times g divided by A plus thirty-two times g divided by A plus p_amb.  

p_g1 equals nine point four bar.  

Ideal gas law:  
R equals R divided by M equals zero point one six six two kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

p_g1 times V_g1 equals R times T_1.  

V_g1 equals R times T_1 divided by p_g1 equals zero point nine eight two cubic meters per kilogram.  

m_g equals V_g1 divided by V_g1 equals three point forty-two times ten to the power of negative three kilograms equals three point forty-two grams.  

V_g1 equals three point fourteen liters.
