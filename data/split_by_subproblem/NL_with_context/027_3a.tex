Pressure consists of weight of fluid plus weight plus outside pressure:  
p_g,1 = (m_g g / A) + (m_EW g / A) + p_amb  

Given:  
D = 10 cm = 0.1 m  
A = π × (0.1 / 2)^2 = 0.0314 m²  

=> p_g,1 = (32 × 9.81 / 0.0314) + (0.1 × 9.81 / 0.0314) + 1 bar  
=> p_g,1 = 1.1002 bar  

Mass of gas: Ideal Gas Law => pV = mRT  

=> m = pV / RT  
=> m = (1.002 × 10^5 Pa × 0.00314 m³) / (8.314 × 10³ / 50 × 773.15 K)  
=> m = 0.0027 kg => ≈ 2.69 g
