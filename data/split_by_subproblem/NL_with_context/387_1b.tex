T KF bar equals average Q A to S divided by m dot W (S A minus S E).  

Q A to S divided by m dot W (S A minus S E).  

m dot equals Q dot divided by h equals delta Q divided by negative delta S equals T bar.  

A to S bar equals 376.136 kilojoules divided by 380 kilojoules.  

Equals c p times (T2 minus T1) divided by c p times ln (T2 divided by T1).  

Equals negative 253.12 kilojoules.
