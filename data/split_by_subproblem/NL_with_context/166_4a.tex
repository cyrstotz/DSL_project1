A diagram is drawn with labeled axes. The x-axis is labeled "T" (temperature), and the y-axis is labeled "p" (pressure). The diagram includes three regions labeled "fest" (solid), "gasfÃ¶rmig" (gaseous), and "flÃ¼ssig" (liquid). A curve separates the regions, with points labeled "1" and "2" on the curve. The label ">Ti" appears near the diagram.
