A T-s diagram is drawn with the following details:  
- The x-axis is labeled as "s [kJ/(kgÂ·K)]".  
- The y-axis is labeled as "T (K)".  
- The diagram includes labeled points:  
  - Point 1 (adiabatic)  
  - Point 2 (isobar)  
  - Point 3 (isobar)  
  - Point 4/5 (mixing)  
  - Point 6 (adiabatic)  
- The isobars are labeled as:  
  - \( p_2 = p_3 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - \( p_0 = p_c = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)
