Energy balance:  
\( u = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a - w_e^2 - w_a^2 / 2 + g (z_e - z_a)) + Q + V \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \).  
The term \( V \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \) is noted as "not considered due to constant volume."  

Equations:  
\( q_{13} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{13}}{\dot{m}_K} \).  
\( q_B = \frac{\dot{Q}_B}{\dot{m}_K} = q_{13} \).  
\( \frac{\dot{m}_M}{\dot{m}_K} = 5.293 = \frac{5.293}{7} \dot{m}_K = (5.293 \cdot 7) \dot{m}_K \).

T zero: p v equals R T implies p divided by R equals constant implies T divided by v.  

T six equals T five, since adiabatic process.  

T four divided by v four equals T six divided by v six.
