Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a pressure-volume (P-v) graph labeled with axes:  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "P [Pa]".  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "v [mÂ³/kg]".  
   - The diagram includes lines for isobaric and isentropic processes, with points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4".  
   - The labels "isobar" and "isentrop" are written near the respective lines.  
   - The text "sorry, falsch gelesen :(" is written next to the diagram.  

2. The second diagram is a pressure-temperature (P-T) graph labeled with axes:  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "P [Pa]".  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "T [K]".  
   - The diagram includes a dome-shaped region with points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4".  
   - The labels "x=0" and "x=1" are written near the respective regions.  
   - The labels "isobar" and "isentrop" are written near the respective lines.
