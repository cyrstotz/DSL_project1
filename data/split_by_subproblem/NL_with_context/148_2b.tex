The equation is written as:  
\( \dot{m} \left( h_e + \frac{w_e^2}{2} \right) = \dot{m} \left( h_a + \frac{w_a^2}{2} \right) \).  

Below this, it references 'Table A-22'.  

The enthalpy difference \( h_e - h_a \) is calculated as:  
\( c_p (T_2 - T_1) = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \times (526.948 \, \text{K} - 431.9 \, \text{K}) = 95.58 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

Values are provided:  
\( T_1 = 431.9 \, \text{K} \).  

The temperature ratio is written as:  
\( \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} \).  

Substituting values:  
\( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.22 = 526.948 \, \text{K} = T_6 \).  

Further calculations include:  
\( 95.58 \, \text{kJ/kg} + \frac{220 \, \text{m/s}^2}{2} - \frac{w_a^2}{2} = 0 \).  

The term \( \frac{w_a^2}{2} \) is calculated as:  
\( \frac{w_a^2}{2} = 95580 \, \text{J/kg} + 24200 \, \text{J/kg} \).

T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n.  

T6 divided by T5 equals (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4.  

T6 equals T5 multiplied by 0.759.  

T6 equals 327.81 K.  

m dot multiplied by (he minus ha plus we squared divided by 2 minus wa squared divided by 2) equals 0.  

he minus ha equals 104.71.  

wa squared divided by 2 equals 104710 joules per kilogram plus 24200 joules per kilogram.  

wa squared divided by 2 equals 128910 joules per kilogram.  

wa squared equals 257820 joules per kilogram.  

wa equals 507.76 meters per second.
