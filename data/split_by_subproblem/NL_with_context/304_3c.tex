O equals m multiplied by (s sub ein minus s sub aus) plus negative Q sub aus divided by T plus Q sub R divided by T plus S sub erz.

Internal energy of the gas:  

Delta U equals m times u two minus m times u one.  
Equals m times c sub v times (T two minus T one).  
Equals 0.002993 kilograms times 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times [(0.003 times 273.15 minus (500 plus 273.15 Kelvin))].  
Equals -0.927 joules.  

W sub u,12 equals m times integral from one to two of p times d v.  
n equals c sub p divided by c sub v.  
Equals R plus c sub v divided by c sub v.  
Equals 1.263.  

W sub u,12 equals m times integral from one to two of R times (T two minus T one) divided by 1 minus n.  
Equals 0.926 joules.

m dot multiplied by (h two minus h one) equals zero.  
h two equals h one.  
h two is read from the table A-11.  
h two equals 93.42.  

T two equals T one.
