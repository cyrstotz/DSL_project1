S_erz equals m_in multiplied by (s_4 minus s_2) multiplied by Q_R divided by 100 degrees Celsius.  

Equals negative m_in multiplied by (0) multiplied by Q_R divided by 100 degrees Celsius.  

Equals negative 0.268 kilowatts per Kelvin.  

Since we performed the calculation for water, we must adjust the result.  

S_erz equals 0.268 kilowatts per Kelvin.
