Water = reactor fluid  

a) Reactor water  

| p | T     | x = 1 |  
|---|-------|-------|  
| 1 | 70°C  | x = 1 |  
| 2 | 100°C | x = 1 |  

Energy balance equation:  
0 = mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at inlet minus enthalpy at outlet) plus reaction heat minus heat flow out  

Heat flow out equation:  
Heat flow out equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at inlet minus enthalpy at outlet) plus reaction heat  

Enthalpy at 70°C, x = 1:  
h at 70°C, x = 1 = 2626.8 kilojoules per kilogram  

Enthalpy at 100°C, x = 1:  
h at 100°C, x = 1 = 2676.1 kilojoules per kilogram  

Reference: Tables A-2 to A-6  

Heat flow out:  
Heat flow out equals 85.2 kilowatts (positive per convention)  

Additional note:  
Heat flow out is considered negative because it exits the system.
