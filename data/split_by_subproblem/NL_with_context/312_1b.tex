T bar KF equals integral from s in to s out of T d s divided by (s out minus s in).  

d H equals T d s plus v d p (ideal liquid).  

h out minus h in divided by (s out minus s in) equals c p KF times (T out minus T in).  

c p KF times natural logarithm of (T out divided by T in).  

T out minus T in divided by natural logarithm of (T out divided by T in).  

Equals 298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by natural logarithm of (298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin).  

Equals 293.12 Kelvin.
