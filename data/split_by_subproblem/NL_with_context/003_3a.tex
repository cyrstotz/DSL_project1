p_g1 equals m_g times g divided by A plus m_EW times g divided by A plus p_amb equals (32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared) divided by (0.05 meters squared times pi) plus (0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared) divided by (0.05 meters squared times pi) plus 1 bar.  

p_g1 equals 140091.4406 pascals equals 1.4 bar.  

p_g1 times V_1 equals m_g times R times T_1 divided by M.  

m_g equals p_g1 times V_1 divided by R times T_1 divided by M equals (140091.4406 pascals times 0.00314 cubic meters) divided by (77.3 pascal cubic meters per kilogram kelvin times 773.15 kelvin) divided by (50 kilograms per kilomole).  

equals 0.00341943 kilograms.
