A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as pressure (p in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows a cycle with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- The process from 1 to 2 is labeled as "isentropic."  
- The process from 2 to 3 is labeled as "isentropic."  
- The process from 3 to 4 is labeled as "isobar."  
- The process from 4 to 1 is labeled as "pressure reduction."
