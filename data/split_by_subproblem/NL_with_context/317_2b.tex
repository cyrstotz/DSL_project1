The following equations and expressions are written:  

Energy balance:  
0 = m dot times (h subscript 5 plus w subscript 5 squared divided by 2) minus m dot times (h subscript 6 plus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2) minus W dot subscript 56  

h subscript 5 = c subscript p times T subscript 5  
h subscript 6 = c subscript p times T subscript 6  

v dot subscript plus delta equals v dot subscript new minus integral from n to 1 of v dp plus delta e  

Some parts of the equations are crossed out.
