\( x_{\text{Ice},2} > 0 \), \( T_{g,2} \), \( p_{g,2} = ? \)  

Volumes 1 and 2 are constant, the gas does not expand into the equilibrium area to keep the temperature constant \( T_2 = T_1 \).  
The pressure is proportional to the volume constant because the membrane does not expand and it is a closed system.  

\( T_{g,2} \) is equal to \( T_{g,1} \) because the volume does not change.  
\( T_{g,2} \) remains because of heat transfer, \( p_{g,1} \) because of the device.
