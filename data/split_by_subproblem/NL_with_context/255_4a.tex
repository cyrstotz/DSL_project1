A diagram is drawn with labeled regions and processes.  
Labels include:  
- "Triple"  
- "Sublimation"  
- "Cooling cycle"  
- "Freeze"  
- "Phase regions"  
Arrows and lines connect various points, but the diagram is heavily crossed out and unclear.

The page contains a labeled diagram.  

The diagram is a phase diagram with the following features:  
- The y-axis is labeled as "p (mbar)" and represents pressure.  
- The x-axis is labeled as "T (째C)" and represents temperature.  
- Three regions are shown and labeled:  
  - "Fest" (solid) in the upper left region.  
  - "Fl체ssig" (liquid) in the upper middle region.  
  - "Gas" (gas) in the lower right region.  
- A curve is drawn separating the solid and liquid regions, labeled "Tripel" (triple point).  
- A horizontal line extends from the liquid region into the gas region, labeled "k체hlen abf체hren" (cooling removal).  
- Two points are marked on the diagram:  
  - One point is at the intersection of the curve and the horizontal line.  
  - Another point is at the end of the horizontal line in the gas region.
