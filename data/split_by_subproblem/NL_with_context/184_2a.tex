\( w_{Luft} = 200 \, \text{m/s} \)  
\( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
\( T_0 = -30^\circ \text{C} \)  
\( q_B = 1195 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
\( T_B = 1289 \, \text{K} \)  

A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled \( T(K) \) and the x-axis labeled \( s(\text{kJ/kgÂ·K}) \). Several curves are shown, each representing isobars. The isobars are labeled \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \) and \( 0.191 \, \text{bar} \). Points are marked and labeled as follows:  
- Point 1  
- Point 2  
- Point 3  
- Point 4  
- Point 5  
- Point 6  

The graph includes arrows indicating transitions between the points. The labels \( T_s \), \( h_0 \), \( p_v \), and \( T_v \) are written near the graph.
