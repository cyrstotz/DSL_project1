A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled regions:  
- "fl√ºssig" (liquid)  
- "2-phasen" (two-phase)  
- "subl" (sublimation)  
- "triple" (triple point)  

The curve shows the phase boundaries, with an arrow pointing to the triple point.
