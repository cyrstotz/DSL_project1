A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kgK]" (specific entropy).  

The diagram includes the following labeled points and processes:  
1. Point 1: "isentropic compression."  
2. Point 2: "isobaric heat addition."  
3. Point 3: "adiabatic, irreversible turbine."  
4. Point 4: "isobaric mixing chamber."  
5. Point 5: "isobaric mixing chamber."  
6. Point 6: "isentropic nozzle."  

Dashed lines indicate isobars, and the dome is marked.

\( S_6 - S_0 = S^0_6 (b) - S^0_0 - R \ln \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right) \)  

\( R = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_{\text{Luft}}} \)  

Interpolation:  
\( S^0_6 = \frac{1.51917 - 1.47824}{250 - 240} (243.75 - 240) + 1.47824 \)  
\( = 1.4911 \, \text{(rounded)} \)  
\( = 1.49113 \)
