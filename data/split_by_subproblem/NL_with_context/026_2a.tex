A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as \( T(K) \) and the x-axis labeled as \( s \). The graph shows several curves and lines representing different states in a jet engine process. The states are labeled as follows:  
- \( p_5 = p_3 \)  
- \( p_2 = p_2 \)  
- \( p_6 = p_4 \)  
- \( p_0 = p_2 \)  

The states are numbered from 0 to 6, with arrows indicating transitions between states. The pressure values are marked at various points:  
- \( p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( p_6 = 0.1916 \, \text{bar} \)
