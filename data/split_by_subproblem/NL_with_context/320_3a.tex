Upper section:  
| T | V | m | Phase |  
| Z1 | 0 degrees Celsius | V1 | 0.1 kg | x equals m_ice divided by m_EW equals 0.6 |  
| Z2 | | V2 | | |  

- EW remains.

Perfect gas:  
c_V equals 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
M_g equals 50 kilograms per kilomole.  

Piston:  
m_K equals 32 kilograms.  
D equals 10 centimeters equals 0.1 meters.  
p_amb equals 1 bar.  

Q_12.

p times V equals m times R times T.  

p equals F divided by A.  

A equals pi times r squared equals pi times (0.1 divided by 2) squared equals 0.007854 square meters.  

p times A equals m sub EW times g plus m sub K times g plus p sub 0 times A minus p sub 1 times A.  

RGW:  
m sub EW times g plus m sub K times g plus p sub 0 times A equals p sub 1 times A.  

p sub 1 equals 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 0.007854 square meters plus 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 0.007854 square meters plus 10 to the power of 5 pascals equals 1.4 bar.  

W sub g equals p sub g times V sub g divided by R times T sub 1 equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 0.00314 cubic meters divided by 166.25 joules per kilogram Kelvin times (500 plus 273.15) Kelvin.  

R equals Q divided by M equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole Kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole equals 166.28 joules per kilogram Kelvin.  

m sub g equals 3.499 grams.
