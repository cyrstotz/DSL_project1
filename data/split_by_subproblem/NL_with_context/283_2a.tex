Two diagrams are drawn, both labeled with axes:  

1. **First Diagram:**  
   - The vertical axis is labeled 'T [K]'.  
   - The horizontal axis is labeled 'S [kJ/kg·K]'.  
   - Points are marked as '0', '1', and '2'.  
   - The curve between points '0' and '1' is labeled 'isobar'.  
   - There are additional scribbles and unclear markings near point '2'.  

2. **Second Diagram:**  
   - The vertical axis is labeled 'T [K]'.  
   - The horizontal axis is labeled 'S [kJ/kg·K]'.  
   - Points are marked as '1', '3', '4', '5', and '6'.  
   - The curve between points '1' and '3' is labeled 'isochor'.  
   - A dashed horizontal line is drawn at point '5', labeled 'T5 = 431.9 K'.  
   - Point '6' is connected to point '5' with a curve.  

Both diagrams are qualitative representations of processes in a T-S diagram.
