dE divided by dt equals Q_12. First law of thermodynamics in the gas container.  

m multiplied by (u_2 minus u_1) equals Q_12.  

m multiplied by (c_V multiplied by (T_2 minus T_1)) equals Q_12.  

0.00342 kilograms multiplied by 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by (273.15 Kelvin minus 773.15 Kelvin) equals Q_12.  

Q_12 equals negative 1082 joules (negative because it flows out of the system boundary, from gas to EW mixture).
