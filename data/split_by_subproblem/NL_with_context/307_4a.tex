A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [Â°C]) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes phase regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "gas."  
- A curve separates the solid and liquid regions, labeled "isobar."  
- Another curve separates the liquid and gas regions, labeled "isotherm."  
- Points labeled "1" and "2" are marked on the diagram, with arrows indicating transitions.  
- A third point labeled "3" is shown, connected to the other points.

In state 2: saturated vapor  

T4 equals T1 equals 31.33 degrees Celsius equals T3
