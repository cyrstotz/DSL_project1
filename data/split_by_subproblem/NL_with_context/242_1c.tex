Entropy production from heat transfer:  
Wall between reactor and coolant:  
Q out divided by T KF  

=> Entropy production:  
S erz equals sum of m dot i times s i plus Q out divided by T R minus Q out divided by T KF plus S erz  

=> S erz equals Q out divided by T KF minus Q out divided by T R  

T R: Isothermal mass vaporization equals 373.15 Kelvin  

S erz equals 62.13 divided by 283.124 minus 62.13 divided by 373.15 equals 45.96 joules per Kelvin
