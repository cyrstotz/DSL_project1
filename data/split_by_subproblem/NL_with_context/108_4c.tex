ṁ = Q_K divided by h  

T_i = -22 degrees Celsius (assumed)  
p_02 = 1.292 bar (Table A-10)  
p_2 = p_1  

Energy balance equation for throttle:  
0 = ṁ multiplied by (h_u minus h_1) implies h_u = h_1  

h_u = 93.62 kilojoules per kilogram  
h_1 = h_u  
h_s = 234.08 kilojoules per kilogram (Table A-10)  
x = (h_1 minus h_f) divided by (h_s minus h_f)  
x = 0.337
