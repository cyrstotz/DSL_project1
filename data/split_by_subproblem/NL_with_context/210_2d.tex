Exergy loss equals Delta exergy stream plus exergy stream from heat divided by mass flow rate, which equals Delta exergy stream plus exergy stream from heat.  

Exergy stream from heat in the combustion chamber:  

Exergy stream from heat equals exergy stream from heat multiplied by (1 minus (243.15 Kelvin divided by 1289 Kelvin)) multiplied by q subscript B.  

Exergy stream from heat equals 969.58 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Exergy loss equals 100 kilojoules per kilogram plus 969.58 kilojoules per kilogram, which equals 1069.58 kilojoules per kilogram.
