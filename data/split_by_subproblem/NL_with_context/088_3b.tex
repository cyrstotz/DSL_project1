T subscript g,2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.  
p subscript g,2 equals p subscript g,1 equals 1.966 bar.  

Temperature:  
Since x subscript Ice is greater than 0, the EW remains in equilibrium, and all the added heat is used for melting, not for temperature increase. Therefore, the gas remains at the same temperature â€” equilibrium temperature.  

Pressure:  
Since the external pressure and the mass are constant, p automatically remains constant as well.
