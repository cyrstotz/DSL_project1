Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled as a T-s diagram.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "s".  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "T".  
   - Several isobaric lines are drawn, including one labeled "0.13 bar".  
   - A process path is shown starting at point "0", moving to point "1", then to point "2".  
   - The segment from "0" to "1" is labeled "isentrop".  
   - The segment from "1" to "2" is labeled "isochor".  

2. The second diagram is labeled as a T-s diagram.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "s".  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "T".  
   - Several isobaric lines are drawn, including one labeled "0.019 bar".  
   - A process path is shown starting at point "0", moving to point "1", then to "2k", "3k", "4k", and finally "5".  
   - The segment from "0" to "1" is labeled "isentrop".  
   - The segment from "2k" to "3k" is labeled "isentrop".  
   - The segment from "3k" to "4k" is labeled "isochor".  
   - The segment from "4k" to "5" is labeled "isochor".
