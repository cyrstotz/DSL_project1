The thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant stream is calculated as:  
T̄_KF = ∫ T ds / (s_a - s_e)  

∫ T ds = q_rev = h_a - h_e  

T̄_KF = (h_a - h_e) / (s_a - s_e) → ideal fluid  

The pressure in the cooling jacket does not change.  

T̄_KF = Cp (T_a - T_e) / Cp ln (T_a / T_e) = (T_a - T_e) / ln (T_a / T_e)  

T_a = 298.15 K  
T_e = 288.15 K  

Substituting values:  
T̄_KF = 293.12146 K  

This result is boxed.
