The following equations and notes are written:  
- "innere u = u2/h"  
- "T2 = -22°C"  
- "ps = pu"  
- "Q̇ = 0 bei Pverd" (heat flow equals zero during compression)  
- "u → 1 Energiebilanz" (energy balance for state 1)  
- "dE/dt = m (h2 - h1) + Q̇ + Ẇ"  
- "h2 = hf + A-11 (Joule)"  
- "hf = 53.42 kJ/kg"  
- "Druck: h2 = h1"  
- "h1(T/p)"  
- "x = h2 - hf / hfg = h1 - hf / hfg"
