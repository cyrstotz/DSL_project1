rho times V equals m times R times T.  

m sub g equals p times V divided by R times T sub g,1 equals (F divided by A plus EW divided by A) times V sub g,1 divided by R times T sub g,1 equals (32.1 times 9.806 divided by (0.05 squared times pi) plus 0.1 times 9.806 divided by (0.05 squared times pi)) times 3.14 divided by 50 times (500 plus 273.15) equals 9.9825399 equals approximately 9.983 g.  

p equals F divided by A equals (F sub K plus F sub EW) divided by (pi times r squared) equals 4087.059939 divided by (pi times 0.05 squared) equals approximately 4087 N divided by m squared.
