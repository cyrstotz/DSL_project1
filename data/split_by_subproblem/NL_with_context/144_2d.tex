First law of thermodynamics:  
Zero equals m gas multiplied by (h zero minus h six minus w six squared minus w zero squared divided by two).  

Exergy balance:  
Zero equals negative delta exergy stream plus (one minus T zero divided by T B) multiplied by q B minus exergy loss.  

Therefore, exergy loss equals (one minus T zero divided by T B) multiplied by q B minus delta exergy stream.  

Equals (one minus T zero divided by T B) multiplied by q B minus delta exergy stream equals 844.11 kilojoules per kilogram.
