A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis. Three regions are labeled:  
- "fest" (solid) in the lower left region.  
- "fl√ºssig" (liquid) in the upper right region.  
- "gas" (gas) in the lower right region.  

Two processes are marked:  
- "i" is a horizontal line in the liquid region.  
- "ii" is a vertical line transitioning from the solid region to the gas region.
