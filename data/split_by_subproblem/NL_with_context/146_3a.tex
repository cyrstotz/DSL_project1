p_g,1 and m_g  

p_g,1 = p_0 plus F_mew divided by A plus F_mew divided by A equals p_0 plus (32 kilograms multiplied by 9.81 meters per second squared plus 0.1 kilograms multiplied by 5.81 meters per second squared) divided by (pi multiplied by d divided by 2 squared).  

p_g,1 = 1.1005 bar.  

p_g,1 multiplied by V_g,1 equals m_g multiplied by R multiplied by T_g,1.  

m_g equals p_g,1 multiplied by V_g,1 divided by R multiplied by T_g,1 equals 1.4 bar multiplied by 3.14 multiplied by 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 8.31 joules per mole kelvin multiplied by 773.15 kelvin.  

m_g equals 0.00342 kilograms equals 3.42 grams.
