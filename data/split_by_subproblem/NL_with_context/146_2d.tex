Exergy loss equals T0 multiplied by entropy production.  

Entropy production equals entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 2.  
Entropy at state 2 equals entropy at state n equals summation of qi divided by Ti plus entropy at state n.  

Entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 2 equals qb divided by Tb minus cp multiplied by ln(T6 divided by T0) minus R multiplied by ln(p6 divided by p0) minus qb divided by Tb.  

Equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by ln(340 Kelvin divided by 243.15 Kelvin) minus 1195 kilojoules per kilogram divided by Tb equals 0.8411 minus 0.4.
