A diagram is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled curves and lines:  
- An "isobar" curve at the top labeled as "8 bar".  
- A horizontal line labeled "isobar" connecting points 1 and 4.  
- A diagonal line labeled "isenthalp" connecting points 1 and 2.  
- A vertical line labeled "isentrop" connecting points 2 and 3.
