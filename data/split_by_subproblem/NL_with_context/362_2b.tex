Subsonic nozzle, reversible:  
p5 = 0.5 bar  
T5 = 431.9 K  
p6 = 0.191 bar  

T6 = T5 multiplied by (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k).  
= 328.07 K (crossed out).  

Energy balance for flow process, adiabatic:  
PE = 0  

Wt = แน multiplied by [he minus ha plus (w6 squared minus w5 squared divided by 2)].  

Wt = integral from 5 to 6 of v dp = integral from 5 to 6 of (R T divided by P) dp.  

Additional notes:  
v = RT divided by P.
