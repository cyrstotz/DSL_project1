Energy balance of the reactor with stationary mass flow:  
0 = m dot in [s in minus s out] plus Q R divided by T minus Q out divided by T plus S erz  

- S erz = m dot in [s out minus s in] minus Q R divided by T plus Q out divided by T  
- S erz = 0.3 kilograms per second (7.3553 minus 7.1553) minus 100 kilojoules divided by 255 Kelvin plus 76.96 kilojoules divided by 295 Kelvin  

s in = s (70 degrees Celsius) = 7.1553 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  
s out = s (100 degrees Celsius) = 7.3553 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  

- S erz = minus 0.2015 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin
