0-1 Isentropic: q equals 0  
1-2 Isentropic: q equals 0  
2-3 Isobaric: w equals 0  
3-4 q equals 0, not isentropic  
4-5 Isobaric: w equals 0  
5-6 Isentropic  

A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The x-axis is labeled "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]"  
- The y-axis is labeled "T [K]"  

The diagram shows several labeled processes:  
- From state 0 to state 1: Isentropic  
- From state 1 to state 2: Isentropic  
- From state 2 to state 3: Isobaric  
- From state 3 to state 4: Not isentropic  
- From state 4 to state 5: Isobaric  
- From state 5 to state 6: Isentropic
