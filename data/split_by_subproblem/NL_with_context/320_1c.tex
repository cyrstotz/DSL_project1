Entropy balance for reactor:  

0 equals Q out divided by T reactor minus Q out divided by T coolant plus S production.  

S production equals Q out divided by T reactor minus Q out divided by T coolant.  

S production equals 65 kilowatts divided by 295 kelvin minus 65 kilowatts divided by 373.15 kelvin.  

S production equals 0.046 kilowatts per kelvin.  

Underlined result: 0.046 kilowatts per kelvin.
