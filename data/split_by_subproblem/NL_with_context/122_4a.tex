A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled curves and points:  
- A curve labeled "Q = 0" appears twice.  
- Another curve labeled "Nassdampfgebiet" (wet steam region).  
- Points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 are connected by lines forming a cycle.  
- The region between points 1 and 2 is marked as "p = d".  
- The region between points 3 and 4 is marked as "p = d".
