T = -30Â°C  
p = 0.191 bar  

A diagram is drawn with six labeled points (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) connected by curves. The labels include:  
- Point 5: T = 431.3 K, p = 0.5 bar, w = 220 m/s  
- Point 6: p = 0.151 bar  

Below the diagram, another graph is drawn with axes labeled "T" (temperature) and "S" (entropy). The graph includes curves labeled "isobar" and "isentrop" connecting points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Pressure values are marked at specific points:  
- p2 = 0.5 bar  
- p = 0.151 bar
