s2 equals s3.  
p3 equals 8 bar.  
x2 equals 1.  
x4 equals 0.  
p4 equals 8 bar.  

Energy balance around the cooler:  
0 equals m dot multiplied by (h1 minus h2) plus Q minus W dot.  

s2 equals s3 minus s3 at 8 bar equals 9.966 multiplied by (x minus 1) equals 9.966 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Adiabatic throttle:  
0 equals m dot multiplied by (h4 minus h1).  
h4 equals h1.  

Energy balance around the compressor:  
0 equals m dot multiplied by (h2 minus h3) plus W dot.  
W dot equals m dot multiplied by specific work.
