A diagram is drawn labeled "T-s diagram." It shows a process with numbered points: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The diagram includes isobars labeled \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), \( p_3 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_5 \). The point \( p_1 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \) is noted. The axes are labeled with "T" (temperature) on the horizontal axis and "S" (entropy) on the vertical axis. Additional notes include:  
- \( T_{KF} \): thermodynamic mean temperature.  
- "Mantle stream, core stream, nozzle."
