R equals R divided by M equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole per kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram per kelvin.  

p gas equals p ambient plus F L divided by A plus F EW divided by A equals p ambient plus m L times g divided by pi times D squared divided by 4 plus m EW times g divided by pi times D squared divided by 4 equals 1 times 10 to the power of 5 newtons per square meter plus 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by (0.1 meters squared divided by 4) plus 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by (0.1 meters squared divided by 4) equals 1.400 times 10 to the power of 5 newtons per square meter equals 1.4 bar.  

p times V equals n times R times T.  
n equals p times V divided by R times T gas.  
m gas equals p gas times V gas divided by R times T gas.  

equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 newtons per square meter times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram per kelvin times 773.15 kelvin equals 3.419 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms equals 3.42 grams.
