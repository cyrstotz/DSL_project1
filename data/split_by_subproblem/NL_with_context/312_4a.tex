A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a dome-shaped curve, indicating phase regions.  

Another graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. It includes labeled points:  
- "4" near the top of the curve  
- "2" and "g" along the lower part of the curve  
- "Tripel" (Triple point) marked near the intersection of lines
