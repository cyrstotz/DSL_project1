A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled as 'T [U]' and the horizontal axis labeled as 'S [S]'. The graph shows a thermodynamic process with labeled points and lines:  
- Point 0 connects to point 1 via an isentropic line.  
- Point 1 connects to point 2 via an isentropic line.  
- Point 2 connects to point 3 via an isobaric line.  
- Point 3 connects to point 4 via an adiabatic and irreversible line.  
- Point 4 connects to point 5 via an isobaric line.  
- Point 5 connects to point 6 via an isentropic line.  
The temperature value '243.15' is marked on the vertical axis.

Stationary process  

=> \( \dot{m}_{ges} (\Delta h + \frac{w_6^2 - w_5^2}{2}) + \sum \dot{Q}_j^0 - \sum \dot{W}_n^0 = 0 \)  

\( \Delta h = \frac{w_0^2 - w_5^2}{2} \)  

\( \Delta h = \int_{T_5}^{T_6} c_p dT = c_p (\ln(T_6) - \ln(T_5)) = \)  

= -0.27 + 66024 kJ  

\( 0.27 + 66024 \cdot 2 + w_5^2 = w_6^2 = 48400.553 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \)  

=> \( w_6 = \)  

\( \Delta h = \int_{T_5}^{T_6} c_p dT = c_p (T_6 - T_5) = -104.442 \, \text{kJ} \)  

=> \( \Delta h \cdot 2 + w_5^2 = w_6^2 = 252294.912 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \)  

\( w_6 = 504.2454159 \, \text{m/s} \)
