A diagram is drawn representing a T-s diagram with labeled isobars and states. The states are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T" for temperature.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "s" for entropy.  
The isobars are labeled as \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_5 \).  
The temperatures \( T_0 = 253.15 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_6 = 328.07 \, \text{K} \) are noted near the diagram.
