The pressure of the gas is the same as in state 1 because the equation does not change.  

The temperature of the gas is lower than in state 1 because heat has flowed into the ice-water mixture.

T2 equals TEW,1 equals 0 degrees Celsius because x2 is greater than 0 and thermodynamic equilibrium.  

Q12 equals mg multiplied by cv multiplied by (TEW,1 minus Tg,1) equals 2.954228 multiplied by 10 to the power of negative 3 multiplied by 0.633 multiplied by (273.15 minus 773.15) equals negative 0.8046 kilojoules.  

In EW flows negative Q12.
