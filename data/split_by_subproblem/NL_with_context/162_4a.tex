A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points and lines:  
- A curve labeled "Triple" at the top.  
- A horizontal line labeled \( p_4 \).  
- Points labeled 1, 2, and 3 connected by arrows.  
- A vertical line labeled \( T_z \).

S subscript 4 equals S subscript 1 plus delta S.  
S subscript 4 equals S subscript f plus S subscript g.  

x equals (S subscript 4 minus S subscript f) divided by (S subscript g minus S subscript f).
