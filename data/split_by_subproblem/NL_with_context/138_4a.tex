Isobaric and isothermal sublimation below the triple point of water.  
Assumptions:  
- Adiabatic, reversible compression.  
- \( Q < 0 \), \( Q > 0 \).  

Description:  
Isobaric sublimation, isothermal sublimation, and reversible adiabatic processes.  

Diagram:  
A graph is drawn with pressure \( p \) on the vertical axis and temperature \( T \) on the horizontal axis.  
The graph includes labeled points:  
- \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), \( p_3 \), \( p_4 \).  
- \( T_1 - \Delta T \), \( T_2 \).  

\( T_i \) is determined from the graph (near the triple point of water).  
\( T_i = -20^\circ \text{C} \), \( T_w = -26^\circ \text{C} \).
