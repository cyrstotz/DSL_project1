Mass of water multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by temperature difference equals mass of water multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by temperature difference plus mass of water multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by temperature difference.  
Delta mass multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by temperature difference equals mass of water multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by temperature difference minus mass of water multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by temperature difference.  
Delta mass equals mass of water multiplied by specific heat capacity multiplied by temperature difference divided by specific heat capacity multiplied by temperature difference minus inlet temperature.  
Delta mass equals 5755 kilograms multiplied by 100 degrees Celsius minus 70 degrees Celsius divided by 80 degrees Celsius minus 20 degrees Celsius.  
Delta mass equals 3453 kilograms.
