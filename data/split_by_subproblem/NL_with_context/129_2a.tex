A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled as "T" (temperature) and the horizontal axis labeled as "s" (entropy). The graph shows a qualitative T-s diagram with labeled points and processes:  
- Point 1 is connected to Point 2 with a reversible process.  
- Point 2 is connected to Point 3 with an isobaric process.  
- Point 3 is connected to Point 4 with an irreversible process.  
- Point 4 is connected to Point 5 with another isobaric process.  
- Point 5 is connected to Point 6 with a reversible process.
