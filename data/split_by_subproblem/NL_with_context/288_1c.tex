Assumption: T KF equals 295 Kelvin.  

Zero equals minus Q dot aus divided by T Reactor,1 plus Q dot aus divided by T KF plus S dot gen.  

S dot gen equals Q dot aus divided by T Reactor,1 minus Q dot aus divided by T KF equals minus 62.18 divided by 373.15 minus minus 62.18 divided by 295 equals 0.044 kilowatts per Kelvin.
