p_g1 equals m_g.  
M_g equals 50 kilograms per kilomole.  
A equals R_cylinder equals D squared times pi divided by 4.  

pV equals m_g times R times T_g.  
p_g1 equals (m_K times g divided by A) plus (m_EW times g divided by A) plus p_ambient equals (m_K plus m_EW) times g divided by D squared times pi divided by 4 plus p_ambient equals 14.0094.  
p_g1 equals 14 bar.  

m_g equals p_1 times V_1 divided by R times T_1.  
R equals R universal divided by M_g equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole Kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

m_g equals 0.003422 kilograms equals 3.422 grams.
