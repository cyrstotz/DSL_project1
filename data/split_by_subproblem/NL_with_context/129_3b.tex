\( T_{g,2}, p_{g,2} \)  

=> \( p_2 \equiv p_1 \) because the force/pressure equilibrium always remains the same.  
\( p_{g,2} = 1.401 \, \text{bar} \)  

For \( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \), the temperature of the EW must always remain at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \), since at state 2 \( Q_{ab} = 0 \), so \( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).
