T-s diagram  

A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 's [L/kgK]'. The diagram includes several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Point 0 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 is connected to Point 0 and labeled with '1.5'.  
- Point 2 is connected to Point 1 and labeled 'p2 = p'.  
- Point 3 is connected to Point 2.  
- Point 4 is connected to Point 3 and labeled 'anchauf 0.5 bar'.  
- Point 5 is connected to Point 4 and labeled '0.5 bar'.  
- Point 6 is connected to Point 5.  

Below the diagram, a table is drawn with columns labeled as follows:  
- z  
- P  
- T [K]  
- S  
- h  

The rows of the table are partially filled:  
- Row 1: P = 0.5 bar  
- Row 2: S = S2  
- Row 3: (empty)  
- Row 9: P = 0.5 bar  
- Row 5: P = 0.5 bar, T = 431.9  
- Row 6: P = 0.191, T = 328.075, S = S5  
- Row 0: P = 0.191  

Below the table, the following text is written:  
"Ideales gas: Isentrope K = 1.4"  
"T6 = T5 Â· (P6 / P5)^(0.4 / 1.4)"
