The header "Drossel adiabate → Flüssigkeit" (Throttle, adiabatic → liquid) is written. Below it, equations are provided:  
- \( h_4 = h_f (8 \, \text{bar}) = 264.4 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  
- \( h_4 = h_f \)  
- \( h_4 = h_f (2 \, \text{bar}) + x \times (h_g (2 \, \text{bar}) - h_f (2 \, \text{bar})) \)  
- \( x = \frac{h_4 - h_f}{h_g - h_f} \)  

The temperature is noted:  
- \( T_Z = -22^\circ \text{C} \)  

Additional notes:  
- \( T_{cold} \)  
- \( p_{11} \)  
- \( p_{12} = 2 \, \text{bar} \)
