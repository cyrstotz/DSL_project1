A diagram is drawn with labeled axes. The x-axis is labeled as temperature (T), and the y-axis is labeled as pressure (P). The diagram includes phase regions labeled "Fast," "Gas," "Triple," and "Fl√ºssig." Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked on the diagram, corresponding to different states in the process.
