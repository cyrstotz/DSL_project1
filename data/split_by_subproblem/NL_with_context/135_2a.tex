A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points and isobars.  
- The vertical axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as 's' (entropy).  
- Points 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curve.  
- Isobars are labeled:  
  - At point 2: \( p = 13 \, \text{bar} \).  
  - Between points 5 and 6: \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
  - Between points 0 and 6: \( p = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).
