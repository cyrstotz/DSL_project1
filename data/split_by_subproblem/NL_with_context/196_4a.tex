A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis. The graph includes labeled points and lines:  
- Point labeled "1" is in the gas phase region.  
- Point labeled "2" is connected to point "1" by an isobaric line.  
- Point labeled "3" is connected to point "2" by an isothermal line.  
- A curve labeled "Triple" separates the liquid and gas phase regions.  
- The regions are labeled "Flüssig" (liquid), "Gas" (gas), and "Gas flüssig" (gas-liquid).
