Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The graph includes labeled regions for solid, liquid, and vapor phases.  
   - A line labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point) is marked.  
   - Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are connected, forming a cycle.  
   - The cycle transitions through the solid, liquid, and vapor regions.  

2. The second diagram is a temperature-entropy (T-s) graph.  
   - The graph includes labeled regions for liquid, liquid vapor, and vapor phases.  
   - Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are connected, forming a cycle.  
   - The cycle transitions through the liquid and vapor regions.  

A smaller sketch of the cycle is drawn in the top-right corner of the page, showing points 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected.
