Since ice is still present, \( T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

The system is isothermal because the piston is movable:  
\( p_{g2} = p_{g1} = 1.38397 \, \text{bar} \).  

The equilibrium state is thermodynamic equilibrium, and since ice remains, everything is at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \):  
\( T_{g2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \).
