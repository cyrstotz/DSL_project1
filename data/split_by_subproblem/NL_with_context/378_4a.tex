Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a rectangular cycle plotted on a temperature (T) versus pressure (p) graph. The cycle is labeled with points 1, 2, 3, and 4, connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
2. The second diagram is a triangular cycle plotted on a temperature (T) versus pressure (p) graph. It includes labeled regions and processes: "isotherm," "isochore," and "isobar." The region labeled "Nassdampf" (wet steam) is marked within the cycle.
