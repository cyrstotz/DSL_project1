The page contains two diagrams:

1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as T (temperature).  
   - The y-axis is labeled as p (pressure).  
   - A rectangular cycle is drawn with four labeled points: 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - The top horizontal line of the rectangle is marked with "8 bar."  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the process flow between the points.

2. The second diagram is another pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as T [K] (temperature in Kelvin).  
   - The y-axis is labeled as p [bar] (pressure in bar).  
   - A curved line is drawn, resembling a dome shape.  
   - A rectangular cycle is drawn within the dome, with four labeled points: 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the process flow between the points.
