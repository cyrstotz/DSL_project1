The following equations and calculations are written:  

**System boundary equation:**  
0 = ṁ (he - hq + (we squared - wa squared) / 2) + Q̇ - Ẇ  

Simplified:  
0 = he - hq + we squared - wa squared / 2  

Further simplified:  
0 = h0 - h6 + w0 squared / 2 - w6 squared / 2  

**Rearranged:**  
w6 squared = 2 (h0 - h6) + w0 squared  
w6 squared = 2 · cp · (T1 - T6) + w0 squared  

**State SE = isentropic:**  
p5 = 0.13 bar  
p6 = 0.15 bar  
T5 = 431.9 K  

**Equation for T6:**  
T6 / T5 = (p6 / p5) raised to the power of (n - 1) / n  
n = 1.4  

Calculation:  
T6 = T5 · (p6 / p5) raised to the power of 1.4 - 1 / 1.4  
T6 = 431.9 K · (0.15 bar / 0.13 bar) raised to the power of 0.4 / 1.4  
T6 = 328.07 K  

**Calculation for w6:**  
w6 = square root of (2 · 1.006 · ((-30°C + 273.15 K) - 328.07 K) + 200 m/s squared)  
w6 = 193.5 m/s  

The final result is underlined:  
w6 = 193.5 m/s
