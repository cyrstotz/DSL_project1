Δexst:  
0 = m dot (he minus ha minus T0 (se minus sa)) plus we squared divided by 2 minus wa squared divided by 2 equals minus Δexst  

T0 = 243.15 K, T6 = 340 K  
ho minus he = cp (T0 minus T6) = 1.006 kJ/kgK (96.85) K = 97.43 kJ/kg  

(se minus sd) = cp ln (T0 divided by T6) minus R ln (p0 divided by p6)  
= cp ln (T0 divided by T0) = 1.006 kJ/kgK ln (243.15 divided by 240) = approx. 0.33  

Δexst = minus m dot (cp (ho minus he) minus T0 (cp ln (T0 divided by T6) plus we squared divided by 2 minus wa squared divided by 2))
