A diagram is drawn with pressure (p) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis. The diagram shows phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Fest + Gas" (solid + gas), "Flüssig + Gas" (liquid + gas), and "Gas" (gas).  
Several points are marked:  
- Point 1 is in the "Flüssig + Gas" region.  
- Point 2 is in the "Fest + Gas" region.  
- Point 3 is in the "Gas" region.  
Arrows indicate transitions between these points.
