Steady flow process with mass flow rate.  
Q dot divided by T plus S external.  

ds divided by dt equals zero equals m dot in times S in minus m dot out times S out plus m dot kf times S in minus m dot kf times S out plus Q dot divided by T plus S external.  

S external equals m dot in times [S out minus S in] plus m dot kf times [S out minus S in].
