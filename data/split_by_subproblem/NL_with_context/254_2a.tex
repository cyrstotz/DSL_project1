A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars:  
- \( p = p_3 \), \( p = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), and \( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \).  
- States 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the diagram.  
- The axes are labeled as \( T \, [\text{K}] \) (temperature) and \( S \, [\text{J/K}] \) (entropy).  
- \( T_0 = 273.15 - 30 = 243.15 \, \text{K} \).
