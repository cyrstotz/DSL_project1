A diagram is drawn representing a T-s diagram with labeled isobars \( p_0 \), \( p_5 \), and \( p_3 \). The states are marked as 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6, with arrows indicating the process flow. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) on the vertical axis and \( s \) (specific entropy) on the horizontal axis.
