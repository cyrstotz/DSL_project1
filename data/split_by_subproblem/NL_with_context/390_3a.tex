- Diagram: A cylinder labeled "p_gas" with arrows pointing to "F_G m_K" and "F_0 EV/A". The base is labeled "A".  
- Equation:  
  A equals 0.05 squared meters times pi equals 23 pi squared centimeters.  
  p_1 equals 1 bar plus 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 0.05 squared meters plus 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by 23 pi squared centimeters.  
  Equals 1.705 times 10 to the power of 5 Newtons per square meter plus 35996.93 Newtons per square meter plus 724.93 Newtons per square meter.  
  Equals 1.90 bar.  

- Equation for m_g:  
  p V equals m R T.  
  m_g equals p_1 V_1 divided by R divided by T_g,1.  
  Equals p_1 V_1 divided by R divided by T_g,1.  
  Equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 divided by 8.314 times 50 divided by 773.15 Kelvin.  
  Equals 0.003479 kilograms equals 3.479 grams.
