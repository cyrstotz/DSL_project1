A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T" (temperature) and the x-axis labeled as "s" (entropy). The graph depicts a thermodynamic process with labeled points:  
- Point 1: "isentropic"  
- Point 2: "isentropic"  
- Point 3: "isobaric"  
- Point 4: "isobaric"  
- Point 5: "isentropic"  
- Point 6: "isentropic"  

Arrows indicate the direction of the process flow between the points.
