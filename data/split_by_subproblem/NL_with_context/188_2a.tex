Sigma divided by sigma zero equals:  

Two times sigma divided by sigma zero plus (gamma minus gamma zero times sigma zero) multiplied by nine hundred r minus two times gamma divided by two hundred times gamma zero.  

Sigma m plus (sigma l minus sigma l zero) times d2 equals:  

Sigma m plus (sigma l minus sigma l zero) times z equals sigma m.  

Sigma l divided by sigma l zero equals one.  

Sigma m divided by sigma l zero equals sigma m divided by sigma l zero plus (sigma l minus sigma l zero) times u equals:  

Sigma m divided by sigma l zero equals sigma m divided by sigma l zero plus (sigma l minus sigma l zero) times u equals:  

Sigma divided by sigma m squared minus sigma m divided by sigma l zero plus (sigma l minus sigma l zero) times u equals zero.  

X times t zero equals k times t zero.  

Four hundred thirty-two point eight zero equals k times eight point four zero.  

Zero point nine eight five zero divided by zero point nine eight five zero equals:  

Sigma l divided by sigma zero equals sigma divided by v minus u equals sigma l.

Below the equations, there is a graph labeled with axes:  
- The horizontal axis is labeled 's'.  
- The vertical axis is labeled 't'.  
- The graph contains several curves labeled with 'sigma d equals sigma d', 'sigma d equals sigma d zero', and 'diagram'.  
- The curves appear to represent a process with points marked along them.  

At the bottom right corner, there is a label:  
'Aufgabe 2'.
