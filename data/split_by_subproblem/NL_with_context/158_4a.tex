A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "P [bar]" (pressure in bar).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  

The diagram shows a curve resembling a phase diagram with labeled points:  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 2 is to the right of Point 1.  
- Point 3 is at the top of the curve.  
- Point 4 is to the right of Point 3.  

The curve is labeled "gesättigte Flüssigkeit" (saturated liquid) on the left side and "gesättigter Dampf" (saturated vapor) on the right side.  

An arrow points from Point 4 to Point 1, labeled "Nassdampf-Gebiet" (wet steam region).
