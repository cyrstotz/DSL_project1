The first law of thermodynamics is written as:  
"1HS: Stationary â†’ Q = 0, W = 0"  

The equation:  
0 = \( \dot{m} \) (h_5 - h_6 + \( w_5^2 \) / 2 - \( w_6^2 \) / 2)  

Expanded to:  
= \( \dot{m} \) c_p (T_5 - T_6) + \( w_5^2 \) / 2 - \( w_6^2 \) / 2  

\( w_6 \) = square root of \( w_5^2 \) + 2 c_p (T_5 - T_6)  

A crossed-out equation is partially visible:  
Q = \( \dot{m} \) (h_2 - h_3) + Q  

Notes:  
"Adiabatic + reversible = isentropic"  
\( m_1 \) = \( k \) = 1.4  

The equation:  
T_6 = T_5 \( (p_6 / p_5)^{(k-1)/k} \)  

T_6 = 431.94 \( (0.191 / 0.5)^{0.4/1.4} \) = 328.07 K  

\( w_0 \) = square root of \( (270 \, \text{m/s})^2 + 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kgK} \cdot (431.94 - 328.07) \)  

\( w_0 \) = 507.25 m/s
