A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph includes several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Point "0" at the bottom left.  
- Point "2" connected to "0" by a curve labeled "drive line".  
- Point "3" connected to "2" by a curve labeled "rotor".  
- Point "5" connected to "3" by a curve labeled "rotor".  
- Point "6" connected to "5" by a curve labeled "rotor".  
- Point "4" connected to "5" by a curve labeled "indoor".  
The graph is shaded between certain curves.
