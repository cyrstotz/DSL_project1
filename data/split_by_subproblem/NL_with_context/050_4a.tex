Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is labeled with axes `p` and `T`. It includes regions marked as "compressed," "ND," and "SH superheated." A curve labeled "St1" is shown, and a point labeled "x" is marked at the intersection. Another point labeled "x3" is marked near the compressed region.  
2. The second diagram is also labeled with axes `p` and `T`. It includes similar regions marked as "compressed," "ND," and "SH superheated." A curve is drawn, and arrows indicate transitions between states.

The diagram shows a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
- In the first graph labeled "i)", the curve represents the compressed gas phase.  
- In the second graph labeled "ii)", the curve shows the sublimation process with a marked region for the solid-liquid equilibrium.
