A graph is drawn with pressure (p) in bar on the vertical axis and temperature (T) in Kelvin on the horizontal axis.  

The graph shows three labeled regions:  
- "Fest" (solid) in the lower left.  
- "Flüssig" (liquid) in the upper middle.  
- "Gasförmig" (gaseous) in the lower right.  

The curve separates the solid, liquid, and gaseous regions and includes a marked "Triple" point.  

Two arrows are drawn on the graph:  
- The first arrow labeled "i" starts in the solid region and moves vertically into the liquid region.  
- The second arrow labeled "ii" starts in the liquid region and moves horizontally into the gaseous region.  

No additional text or equations are present.
