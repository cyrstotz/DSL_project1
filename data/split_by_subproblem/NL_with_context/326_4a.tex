Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled "p [bar]" on the vertical axis and "T [째C]" on the horizontal axis. It shows phase regions with the triple point marked. The regions are labeled "Gas," "Fest" (solid), and "Fl체ssig" (liquid). An isobaric line is drawn, and two points are marked: "1" and "2." The line connecting these points is labeled "isotherm."  

2. The second diagram is also labeled "p [bar]" on the vertical axis and "T [째C]" on the horizontal axis. It shows the triple point and a region labeled "10K 체ber Sublimationspunkt" (10K above sublimation point). Another region is labeled "5mbar unter Tripelpunkt" (5 mbar below triple point).
