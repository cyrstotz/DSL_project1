A graph is drawn with the axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "[k] kg/K" (entropy per kilogram per Kelvin).  

The graph shows a qualitative T-s diagram with six labeled points:  
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.  
The curve includes isobars labeled as "p0 = p6" and "p3/p2 = p3".

Zero equals m total times delta exergy flow plus Z times W minus exergy loss.  

W zero equals  

Exergy loss equals m total times delta exergy flow minus W.
