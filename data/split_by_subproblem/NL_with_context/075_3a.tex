p_g,1 and m_g calculations:  
c_V equals 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
M_g equals 50 kilograms per kilomole.  
T_g equals 500 degrees Celsius, which is 773.15 Kelvin.  
V_g,1 equals 3.14 liters, which is 0.00314 cubic meters.  

p equals m times R times T divided by V.  
m equals...  

Area (A) equals pi divided by 4 times diameter squared.  
A equals (pi divided by 4) times (0.05 meters squared), which equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.  

p equals F divided by A.  
p equals p_amb plus (32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared) divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.  
p equals 100000 pascals plus 39469.1 pascals, which equals 1.3947 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals.  
This equals p_g,1.  

m equals p times V divided by R times T.  
R equals 0.1663.  

m equals (1.3947 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 0.00314 cubic meters) divided by (0.1663 times 773.15 Kelvin).  
m equals 3.418 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms.  
m equals 3.418 grams.
