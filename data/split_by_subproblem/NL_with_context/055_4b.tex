0 equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at exit minus enthalpy at inlet) plus kinetic energy plus gravitational energy (z exit minus z inlet), plus heat transfer rate minus work input.  
This simplifies to:  
0 equals mass flow rate of R134a multiplied by (enthalpy at state 1 minus enthalpy at state 4) plus heat transfer rate plus (-heat transfer rate of sublimation) plus heat transfer rate plus 28 watts.  

0 equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 1 minus enthalpy at state 2) plus heat transfer rate.  
Heat transfer rate equals mass flow rate of R134a multiplied by (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 1).  

From state 2 to state 3:  
0 equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 3) plus heat transfer rate plus 28 watts.  
This expands to:  
0 equals mass flow rate multiplied by the integral from T1 to T2 of specific heat capacity as a function of temperature multiplied by dT, plus specific volume multiplied by (pressure at state 2 minus pressure at state 1), plus heat transfer rate plus 28 watts.  

Enthalpy at state 2 equals enthalpy at state 3.  
Enthalpy at state 2 is saturated vapor.
