Thermodynamic mean temperature T bar:  
T bar equals Q dot out divided by (S KF out minus S KF in).  

T bar equals Q dot out divided by m dot KF times c KF times ln(T KF out divided by T KF in).  

First law of thermodynamics for the cooling jacket:  
Q dot out equals m dot KF times (h KF in minus h KF out).  

Q dot out equals minus c KF times (T in minus T out) times m dot KF.  

Therefore, Q dot out divided by m dot KF equals minus c KF times (T in minus T out).
