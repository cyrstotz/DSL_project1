A graph is drawn with pressure (p) labeled on the y-axis in bar and temperature (T) labeled on the x-axis in degrees Celsius. The graph shows a curve with a peak, and the region labeled "ND" is highlighted along the curve. The text "p & T geh√∂ren zusammen" is written near the curve, indicating that pressure and temperature are related.
