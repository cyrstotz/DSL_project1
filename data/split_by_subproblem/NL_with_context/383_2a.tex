State | p [bar] | T [K] | w [m/s] | s [kJ/kg·K]  
0 | 0.191 | 200 | s0 = s2  
1 | s1 = s2  
2 | s2 = s1  
3 | p3 = p2  
4 | 0.5 | 431.9 | 220 | s5 = s6  
5 | s6 = s5  

Below the table, a T-s diagram is drawn:  
- The x-axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]".  
- The y-axis is labeled as "T [K]".  
- The diagram includes curves representing isobars at 0.191 bar and 0.5 bar.  
- States 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves.  
- Arrows indicate transitions between states.  
- A note is written: "(isobare etwas zu steil skizziert)" meaning "(isobar sketched slightly too steep)".
