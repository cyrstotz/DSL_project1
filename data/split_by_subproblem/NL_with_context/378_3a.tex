Cp times Mg implies pg equals m times R times Tg divided by Va.  

R equals R divided by Mg equals 166.28 joules per kilogram Kelvin.  

m equals pg times Va divided by R times Tg.  

A2 equals pi times r squared equals pi times D squared divided by 4 equals pi times 0.1 squared divided by 4.  

pg equals MEW times g divided by A2 plus 32 kilograms times g divided by A2 plus pg equals 490 kilopascals minus atmospheric pressure equals 1.46 bar.  

m equals 3.4217 grams.
