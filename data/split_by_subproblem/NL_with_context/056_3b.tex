Delta U equals sum of Q.  
mEW times (u2 minus u1) equals Q12.  
u2 mean equals u1 mean minus Q12 divided by mEW.  
u2 equals minus Q12 divided by mEW plus u1 mean.  
u2 equals minus 181.9238.

\( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \)  
\( x_{Ice,1} = 0.6 \)  
\( m_{EW} = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \)  
\( T_{EW} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  
\( T_{g,2} = ??? \)  

Temperature of the gas becomes smaller as heat flows into the EW. The pressure remains constant because the equilibrium depends on the external pressure.  
The equilibrium is now at another point.
