Entropy balance for a steady flow process:  
zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by entropy at the outlet minus entropy at the inlet plus heat flow out divided by temperature plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals negative mass flow rate multiplied by entropy at the outlet minus entropy at the inlet minus heat flow out divided by temperature.  

Ideal fluid:  
Entropy at the outlet minus entropy at the inlet equals specific heat capacity at constant pressure multiplied by the natural logarithm of temperature at the outlet divided by temperature at the inlet.  

Energy balance in the ideal fluid:  
zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by enthalpy at the outlet minus enthalpy at the inlet plus heat flow out.  

Mass flow rate equals heat flow out divided by enthalpy at the outlet minus enthalpy at the inlet.  

Mass flow rate equals heat flow out divided by specific heat capacity at constant pressure multiplied by temperature at the outlet minus temperature at the inlet.  

Entropy production equals negative heat flow out divided by specific heat capacity at constant pressure multiplied by temperature at the outlet minus temperature at the inlet multiplied by specific heat capacity at constant pressure multiplied by the natural logarithm of temperature at the outlet divided by temperature at the inlet minus heat flow out divided by temperature.  

Entropy production equals negative six hundred twenty-three point two kilojoules per kelvin.
