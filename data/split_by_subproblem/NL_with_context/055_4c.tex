x equals phi subscript f plus x multiplied by (phi subscript g minus phi subscript f).  
Entropy equals entropy subscript f plus x multiplied by (entropy subscript g minus entropy subscript f).  
Entropy at state 1 equals entropy at state 4.  

Therefore, at state 4, the refrigerant is completely condensed.
