A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p [bar]" and the x-axis labeled as "T [Â°C]". The graph shows a curve labeled "Tripel" at the peak. The y-axis includes markings for "1 mbar" and "1 bar". Two points are marked on the graph: "1" near the lower left and "2" near the lower right. The x-axis includes a label "Ti" near the left side.
