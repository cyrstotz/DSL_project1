Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled with axes `p` (pressure) and `T` (temperature). It includes a rectangular cycle with points labeled `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`. The point `Triple` is marked near the bottom left corner. The cycle is shaded diagonally.  

2. The second diagram is also labeled with axes `p` (pressure) and `T` (temperature). It shows a similar rectangular cycle with points labeled `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`. The point `Triple` is marked near the bottom left corner.  

Below the diagrams, the following notes are written:  
- `Ti = 5Â°C`  
- `1: r2 = p1`  
- `2: p2 = p1`  
- `3: 8 bar`  
- `4: 6 bar`  
- `x2 = 1`  
- `x = 0`  
- `w = 28 w`
