To determine w6 and T6:  
- Luft = ideal gas  
- p0 multiplied by v0 equals R multiplied by T0.  

Constants and calculations:  
- R_luft = 8.314 joules per mole kelvin divided by M_luft = 8.314 joules per mole kelvin divided by 28.97 times 10 to the power of -3 kilograms per mole = 287 joules per kilogram kelvin.  

Additional notes:  
- From state 5 â†’ 6, the process is isentropic.  
- S6 equals S5.  
- T5 = 0.5 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals, 431.9 kelvin (from Table A-22).  

Further calculations are incomplete.
