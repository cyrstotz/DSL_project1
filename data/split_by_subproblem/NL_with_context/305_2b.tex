The equation is written:  
h subscript 5 plus w subscript 5 squared divided by 2 equals h subscript 6 plus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2.  

The text reads:  
"Düse ist adiabop → s subscript 5 equals s subscript 6 → n equals k equals 1.4."  

The equation is written:  
T subscript 6 equals T subscript 5 multiplied by (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 5) raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k).  

The calculation follows:  
T subscript 6 equals 431.9 K multiplied by (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4 equals 328.07 K.  

The result is underlined:  
328.07 K  

The equation is written:  
w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 equals h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 plus w subscript 5 squared divided by 2.  

The calculation follows:  
w subscript 6 squared divided by 2 equals c subscript p multiplied by (T subscript 5 minus T subscript 6) plus w subscript 5 squared divided by 2.  

The calculation continues:  
equals 1.006 kJ divided by kg·K multiplied by (431.9 minus 328.07 K) plus (220 m/s) squared divided by 2.  

equals 104.45 kJ plus 24.2 kJ equals 128.65 kJ.  

The equation is written:  
w subscript 6 equals square root of (2 multiplied by 128.65 kJ).  

The result is calculated:  
w subscript 6 equals 507.29 m/s.  

The result is underlined:  
507.29 m/s.
