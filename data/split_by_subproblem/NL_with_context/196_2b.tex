w6 = ?  
T6 = ?  

w5 = 200 meters per second  
p5 = 0.5 bar  
T5 = 431.9 Kelvin  
p6 = p0 = 0.191 bar  

The equation is written:  
O = ṁ (s6 - s0) + Q̇ / Tj + s6 / 2 = 0  
Adiabatic, irreversible  

s6 - s0  

Polytropic temperature ratio: n = 1.4  

T2 = T1 (p2 / p1) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n  

T6 = T5 (p6 / p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n = 431.9 Kelvin multiplied by (0.191 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1) divided by 1.4 = 328.07 Kelvin  

Energy balance:  
O = ṁ (h6 minus h0) + w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2  

O = h6 minus h0 + w6 squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2  

w6 squared = 2 (h6 minus h0) + w0 squared

\( h_e - h_a \)  
\( h_5 - h_a = c_p \cdot (431.9 \, K - 328.07 \, K) \)  
\( c_p = 1.006 \, \frac{kJ}{kg \cdot K} \)  
\( = 1.006 \cdot 103.83 \)  
\( = 104.498 \, \frac{kJ}{kg} \)  

\( w_e = 220 \, \frac{m}{s} \)  

\( w_a = \sqrt{2.104.498 \, \frac{kJ}{kg} + \frac{(220 \, \frac{m}{s})^2}{100}} \)  
\( = \sqrt{2.104.498 \, \frac{kJ}{kg} \cdot 1000 + (220 \, \frac{m}{s})^2} \)  
\( = 507.294 \, \frac{m}{s} \)
