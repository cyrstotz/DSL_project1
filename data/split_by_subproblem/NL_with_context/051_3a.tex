R equals R divided by M equals R divided by fifty kilograms per mole equals zero point one six six three joules per kilogram Kelvin equals one hundred sixty-six point two nine joules per kilogram Kelvin.  

p sub g one equals p sub amb plus m sub g divided by A.  

m total equals m sub K plus m sub EW equals thirty-two plus zero point one equals thirty-two point one kilograms.  

A equals zero point zero five meters squared times pi equals zero point zero zero two eight five four meters squared.  

p sub g one equals one point one zero to the power of five pascals plus four thousand thirty-nine point nine equals one point nine one zero bar.  

m sub g equals p sub g one times V sub one divided by R times T sub one equals one point nine times ten to the power of five times three point one four times ten to the power of negative three divided by one hundred sixty-six point two five times seven hundred seventy-three point one five Kelvin equals zero point zero zero three nine kilograms.  

m sub g equals three point nine two grams.
