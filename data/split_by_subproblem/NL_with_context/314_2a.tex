A graph is drawn with the title "Aufgabe 2". The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "[s]" (entropy).  

The graph depicts a qualitative T-s diagram with six labeled points: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- A curve connects these points in sequence, showing the process flow.  
- Between points 3 and 4, the label "isobar" is written.
