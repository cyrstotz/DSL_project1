The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) equals the temperature \( T_{EW} \) because \( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \), meaning there is still ice present. Therefore, \( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ C = T_{EW} \).  

The pressure \( p_{g,2} \) equals \( p_{EW} = 740-744 \, Pa \approx 744 \, Pa \), as the forces from inside and outside are equal. This corresponds to an isobaric expansion.
