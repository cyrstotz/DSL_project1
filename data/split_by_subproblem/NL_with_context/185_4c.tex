The vapor quality (\( x_1 \)) is determined directly after the expansion valve.  
The temperature \( T_1 \) is given as:  
\( T_1 = T_i - 6K \)  

A note mentions an adiabatic process from state 4 to state 1.  

A formula for \( x \) is written:  
\( x = S_a - S_if / S_g - S_if \)  

A small diagram shows a pressure (P) versus temperature (T) graph with a labeled region and a point marked.  

Additional small notes at the bottom mention:  
\( q = 0 \), \( T_m - T_e = 5 \text{mbar} \), and other small variables.
