A table is drawn with columns labeled \( p \), \( T \), and \( x \). Rows are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. The following values are written in the table:

- Row 1: \( p \) = blank, \( T \) = \( T_i \), \( x \) = 1
- Row 2: \( p \) = \( p_1 \), \( T \) = blank, \( x \) = 1
- Row 3: \( p \) = 8 bar, \( T \) = blank, \( x \) = blank
- Row 4: \( p \) = 8 bar, \( T \) = blank, \( x \) = 0

Annotations next to the table:
- "isobar" is written next to rows 1 and 2.
- "isentrop" is written next to rows 2 and 3.
- "isenthalb" is written next to rows 3 and 4.

Below the table:
- \( T_2 = T_1 = T_i - 6 \, K = -16^\circ C = 257.15 \, K \)
- \( T_i = -10^\circ C \)
