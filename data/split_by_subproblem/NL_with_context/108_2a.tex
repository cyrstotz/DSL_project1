A diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]".  
- The y-axis is labeled as "T [K]".  

The diagram shows a process with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.  
- Point 0 is at the bottom left, and the curve moves upward to point 1.  
- Point 1 connects to point 2, which is higher on the curve.  
- Point 2 connects to point 3, which is slightly higher.  
- Point 3 connects to point 5, which is at the top of the curve.  
- Point 5 connects to point 6, which is slightly lower.  

The following labels are written:  
- "p0 = p6"  
- "p2 = p3"  
- "p5"  

Dashed lines are drawn to indicate isobars.
