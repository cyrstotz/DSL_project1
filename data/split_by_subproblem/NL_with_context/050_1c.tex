c) \( \dot{S}_{erz} \)  

Diagram: A rectangular box labeled "KF1" on the left and "KF2" on the right, with arrows indicating inlet and outlet flows. The inlet temperature is labeled "293.12 K" and the outlet temperature is labeled "100Â°C".  

Equation:  
\( \dot{S}_{erz} \) = \( \frac{\dot{Q}_{out}}{323.75 K} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{out}}{293.12 K} \)  
= \( 0.047 \, \text{kW/K} = 47.72 \, \text{kW/K} \)
