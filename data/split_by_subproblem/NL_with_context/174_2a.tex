A graph is drawn with labeled axes. The vertical axis is labeled as \( p \) (pressure), and the horizontal axis is labeled as \( s \) (specific entropy, \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)). Three isobars are shown: \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), and \( p_2 \). Six points are marked and labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, connected by lines to represent the process.
