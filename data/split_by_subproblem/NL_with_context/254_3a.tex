Rg equals 8.314 divided by 50 equals 0.16624 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

pg,1 equals pamb plus (mg plus mEW) times g divided by A equals pamb plus (mg plus mEW) times g divided by delta P.  

mg,1 equals (Rg times T1 divided by pamb times Vg,1) to the power of negative one equals (0.16624 times 773.15 divided by 1.01 times 10 to the power of 5 times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3) kilograms equals 3.419 times 10 to the power of negative 2 kilograms equals 3.419 grams.
