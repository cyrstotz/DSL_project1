Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph with a curved line that appears to represent phase transitions. The axes are labeled with 'p' (pressure) on the vertical axis and 'T' (temperature) on the horizontal axis.  
2. The second diagram is also a p-T graph, showing three labeled regions:  
   - 'fest' (solid)  
   - 'fl√ºssig' (liquid)  
   - 'Gas' (gas)  
   The triple point ('TP') is marked, and a line labeled 'Ti' is drawn above the triple point.
