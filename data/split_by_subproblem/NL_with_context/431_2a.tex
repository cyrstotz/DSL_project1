A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph shows several curves representing isobars labeled as \( p_0 = p_8 \), \( p_4 = p_5 \), and \( p_2 = p_3 \). Points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves, indicating different states in the process.
