An equation is written:  
x1 equals (h1 minus hf) divided by (hg minus hf).  

Another equation is written:  
h3: s3 equals s2 equals 0.9169 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

A note reads: "Ãœberhitzt" (superheated).  

Interpolation is performed:  
h3 equals 264.15 kilojoules per kilogram plus (273.66 minus 264.15) divided by (0.9374 minus 0.9066) times (0.9169 minus 0.9066).
