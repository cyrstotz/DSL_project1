The equation for energy balance is written:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2} + g z_e - g z_a \right] + \dot{Q} - \sum \dot{W} \)  

For states 5-6 (isentropic):  
\( 0 = \dot{m} \left[ h_s - h_6 + \frac{w_5^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right] + 0 - 0 \)  
\( = \dot{m}_{\text{ges}} \left[ h_r - h_6 + \frac{220^2 - w_6^2}{2} \right] \)  

To find \( h_5 - h_6 \):  
- Air is treated as ideal gas with \( c_p = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \).  
- For states 5-6 (isentropic), \( n = \kappa = 1.4 \):  
\( h(T_5) - h(T_6) = c_p \cdot (T_5 - T_6) \)  
\( = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \cdot (431.9 - T_6) \)

h6 minus h5 equals 220 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2.  
h6 minus h5 equals 200 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2.  

5 to 6 isentropic.  

T6 divided by T5 equals P6 divided by P5 raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n.  
T6 divided by T5 equals (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of kappa minus 1 divided by kappa.  
T6 divided by T5 equals (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4.  
T6 divided by T5 equals 0.759608.  

T6 equals 0.759608 multiplied by 431.9 K.  
T6 equals 328.05747 K.  

Von(1):  
0 equals 1.006 multiplied by (431.9 K minus 328.05747 K) plus 220 squared minus w6 squared divided by 2.  
0 equals 104.4882 plus 24200 minus w6 squared divided by 2.  
w6 squared divided by 2 equals 24304.  
w6 equals square root of 48608.  
w6 equals 220.472 meters per second.
