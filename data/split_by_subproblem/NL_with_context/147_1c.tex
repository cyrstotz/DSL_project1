Zero equals inlet mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between entropy at the outlet and entropy at the inlet, minus heat flow divided by the thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant, plus entropy production.  

Entropy production equals inlet mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between entropy at the outlet and entropy at the inlet, plus heat flow divided by the thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant.  

Zero equals inlet mass flow rate multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at the outlet and enthalpy at the inlet, plus heat flow.  

Inlet mass flow rate equals heat flow divided by the difference between enthalpy at the outlet and enthalpy at the inlet, which equals 62.182 kilograms per second.
