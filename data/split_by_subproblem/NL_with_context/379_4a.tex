A diagram is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled regions and curves:  
- A curve labeled "Triple Point" and another labeled "Critical Point."  
- The pressure scale ranges from 1 mbar to 6 mbar.  
- The temperature scale ranges from -102°C to 0°C to 20°C.  
- A point labeled "Step ii" is marked below the triple point.  
- The temperature \( T_i = -20^\circ C = 253.15 \, \text{K} \) is noted.
