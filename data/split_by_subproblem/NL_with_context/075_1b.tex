T_KF calculation:  

T_KF = integral of T dS divided by (S_a - S_e)  

T dS = dH  

S_a - S_e = c_p ln(T_2 / T_1) - R ln(p_2 / p_1)  

For constant c_p and constant pressure:  
T_KF = c_p (T_2 - T_1) divided by c_p ln(T_2 / T_1)  

T_KF = 10 K divided by ln(293.15 / 288.15)  
T_KF = 243.12 K = 19.97Â°C
