A graph is drawn with pressure (p [bar]) on the y-axis and temperature (T [K]) on the x-axis. The graph includes labeled regions and processes:  
- "solid" phase on the left.  
- "gasf√∂rmig" (gaseous) phase on the right.  
- A curve labeled "ND" (possibly indicating a dome or phase boundary).  
- Processes labeled:  
  - "i)" isochor (constant volume).  
  - "ii)" isobar (constant pressure).  
  - "iii)" isotherm (constant temperature).  
  - "iv)" isochor (constant volume).
