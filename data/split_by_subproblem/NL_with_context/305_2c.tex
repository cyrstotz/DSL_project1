Delta ex_str equals h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 times (s_6 minus s_0) plus w_6 squared divided by 2 minus w_0 squared divided by 2.  
Equals c_p times (T_6 minus T_0) minus T_0 times (c_p times ln(T_6 divided by T_0) minus R times ln(p_6 divided by p_0)) plus w_6 squared divided by 2 minus w_0 squared divided by 2.  
Equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (328.07 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin) minus 243.15 Kelvin times (1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times ln(328.07 divided by 243.15) minus 0.287 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times ln(0.5 divided by 0.191)) plus (220 meters per second squared divided by 2 minus 56.72 meters per second squared divided by 2).  
Equals 12.16 kilojoules plus 128.55 kilojoules minus 24.26 kilojoules.  
Equals 116.6 kilojoules.
