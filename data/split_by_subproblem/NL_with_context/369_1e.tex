Delta S one two equals S two minus S one.  

Delta S one two equals S two minus S one times m two.  

S two times m two equals S two times five seven five five kilograms plus three hundred kilograms.  

S one times m one equals S one times five seven five five kilograms.  

S two at twenty degrees Celsius equals zero point four six four kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

S one at one hundred degrees Celsius and zero point zero zero five x equals two point three zero six kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin plus zero point zero zero five times seven point three five four kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus seven point three zero six kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin equals two point three three four kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Delta S one two equals seven two two seven point nine four kilojoules.
