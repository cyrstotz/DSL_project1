FBD:  
p1 = p_amb + p_K + p_EW = p_amb + g (m_K + m_EW) divided by (pi times D squared divided by 4)  

[Diagram]  
A cylinder is drawn with three sections:  
- Top section labeled "p_amb" with arrows pointing downward.  
- Middle section labeled "p_K" with arrows pointing downward.  
- Bottom section labeled "p_EW" with arrows pointing downward.  
The cylinder is labeled "EW" in the middle section.  

p_K = m_K times g divided by (pi times D squared divided by 4)  
p_EW = m_EW times g divided by (pi times D squared divided by 4)  

=> p1 = 10 to the power of 5 N divided by m squared plus (9.82 times 32 plus 0.1) kg times g divided by (pi times 0.1 squared m squared divided by 4)  
= 1,401.20 N divided by m squared  
=> 3.402 bar
