Delta exergy, stream equals exergy, stream, 6 minus exergy, stream, 0 equals question mark.  

Delta exergy, stream equals Delta h_OG minus T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0) plus Delta ke_OG.  

Delta h_OG equals the integral from T_0 to T_6 of c_p dT equals c_p multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) equals 360 multiplied by (431.9 minus 243.15) equals 85.93 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta s_6,0 equals the integral from T_0 to T_6 of c_p divided by T dT minus R multiplied by ln(p_6 divided by p_0) equals c_p multiplied by (ln(T_6) minus ln(T_0)) minus R multiplied by ln(p_6 divided by p_0) equals 6.30135 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta ke_OG equals (w_6 squared minus w_0 squared) divided by 2 equals (220 squared minus 200 squared) divided by 2 equals 108.648 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Therefore, Delta exergy, stream equals Delta h minus T_0 multiplied by Delta s plus Delta ke equals 113.426 kilojoules per kilogram.
