Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a T-s (temperature-entropy) graph labeled with isobars.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "s" (entropy), and the y-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
   - Several curves are drawn, representing isobars labeled as P0, P2, P4, and P5.  
   - Points are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 along the curves.  
   - A dashed line connects points 1 to 2, and another dashed line connects points 5 to 6.  

2. The second diagram is a T-v (temperature-volume) graph labeled with isobars.  
   - The x-axis is labeled as "v" (volume), and the y-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature).  
   - Several curves are drawn, representing isobars labeled as P0, P2, P4, and P5.  
   - Points are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 along the curves.  
   - A dashed line connects points 1 to 2, and another dashed line connects points 5 to 6.
