In state 1, we have a pressure balance:  
p amb plus F S divided by A equals p i.  
This implies p amb plus (m K plus m EW) times g divided by (D squared divided by 4 times Ï€).  
Result: 140089.4 Pa.  

Using p V equals n R T:  
T equals 500 plus 273.15 equals 773.15 K.  

n equals p V divided by R T approximately equals 0.068.  
With M g equals 50 mg per mmol, we obtain:  
m g equals M g times 1000 divided by 1000 approximately equals 3.42 g.
