Thermodynamic mean temperature:  
T equals integral of T dS from state 2 to state e, which equals enthalpy at state a minus enthalpy at state e divided by entropy at state a minus entropy at state e.  

This equals specific heat capacity times (temperature outlet minus temperature inlet) plus velocity squared divided by two times (pressure outlet minus pressure inlet).  

Specific heat capacity times natural logarithm of temperature outlet divided by temperature inlet.  

298.15 Kelvin minus 288.15 Kelvin divided by natural logarithm of 298.15 Kelvin divided by 288.15 Kelvin equals 293.12 Kelvin, which equals thermodynamic mean temperature.
