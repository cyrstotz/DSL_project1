Energy balance for the entire turbine:  

The equation is written as:  
dE/dt = Σ ṁ (hi + ke + pe) + Σ Q̇j - Σ Ẇn  

Several terms are crossed out:  
- 'ke' (kinetic energy)  
- 'pe' (potential energy)  
- 'Σ Q̇j' (heat flow)  
- 'Σ Ẇn' (work flow)  

The simplified equation becomes:  
0 = ṁges (h6 - h5) + (w6 squared - w5 squared) / 2  

From state 5 to state 6 (isentropic):  
Tb / T5 = (p6 / p5) raised to the power of (n - 1) / n  

Tb = (p6 / p5) raised to the power of (n - 1) / n multiplied by T5  

Tb = 328.07 K

w subscript 6 squared equals two times (h subscript 0 minus h subscript 6) plus w subscript 0 squared.  
w subscript 0 equals w subscript Luft.  
T subscript 0 equals 273.15 Kelvin.  

w subscript 6 equals the square root of two times (h subscript 0 minus h subscript 6) plus w subscript 0 squared.  

w subscript 6 squared equals two times the integral from T subscript 0 to T subscript 6 of c subscript p, Luft dT plus w subscript 0 squared equals two times c subscript p, Luft times (T subscript 0 minus T subscript 6) plus w subscript 0 squared.
