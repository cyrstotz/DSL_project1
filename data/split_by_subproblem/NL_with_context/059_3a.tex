A equals pi times r squared.  
r equals 0.05 meters.  
A equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.  

F equals m subscript K times g.  
p subscript K equals F divided by A.  
F equals 32 times 9.81.  
p subscript K equals 32 times 9.81 divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3.  
p subscript K equals 39369.53 pascals, approximately 0.399 bar.  

p subscript EW equals m subscript EW times g divided by A.  
p subscript EW equals 0.1 times 9.81 divided by 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3.  
p subscript EW equals 124.90 pascals, approximately 0.001249 bar.  

p subscript g,1 equals p subscript K plus p subscript EW plus p subscript amb.  
p subscript g,1 equals 1.14 bar.  

p subscript g times V subscript g equals m subscript g times R times T divided by M.  
m subscript g equals p subscript g times V subscript g times M divided by R times T.  
m subscript g equals 1.14 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters times 50 kilograms per kilomole divided by 8.314 times (500 plus 273.15).  
m subscript g equals 0.818 grams.
