A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis labeled in millibar [mbar] and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis labeled in degrees Celsius [Â°C].  

Key features of the graph:  
- The graph includes three regions labeled "gas," "wasser" (water), and "Eis" (ice).  
- The triple point is marked at the intersection of the isotherm and isobar lines.  
- The isotherm line is horizontal, labeled "isotherm," and connects points 2 and 3.  
- The isobar line is vertical, labeled "isobar," and connects points 1 and 2.  
- Points are labeled as 1, 2, and 3.  
- The regions are separated by lines corresponding to phase transitions.  
- The labels "(ii)" appear near points 1 and 2, indicating the second step of the process.  
- The label "(i)" appears near points 1 and 2, indicating the first step of the process.  

Additional notes:  
- The triple point is explicitly labeled.  
- The graph visually represents the phase regions and transitions between ice, water, and gas.
