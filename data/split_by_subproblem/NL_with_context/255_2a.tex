Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. **Diagram 1 (Top)**:  
   - The axes are labeled as follows:  
     - Vertical axis: T (temperature).  
     - Horizontal axis: S (entropy) with units [kJ/kg·K].  
   - A curve is drawn, resembling a peak or wave-like shape.  

2. **Diagram 2 (Bottom)**:  
   - The axes are labeled as follows:  
     - Vertical axis: T (temperature).  
     - Horizontal axis: S (entropy) with units [kJ/kg·K].  
   - Several isobars are drawn as curved lines.  
   - Points are marked and labeled sequentially from 0 to 6 along the process path.  
   - The process path includes:  
     - A curve from point 0 to point 1.  
     - A vertical line from point 1 to point 2.  
     - A diagonal line from point 2 to point 3.  
     - A horizontal line from point 3 to point 4.  
     - A zigzag line from point 4 to point 5.  
     - A vertical line from point 5 to point 6.  
   - Additional labels:  
     - Near point 5: "kpk" and "ps = pu".  
     - Near point 6: "Po".
