The question is written: "w_6 = ? ; T_6 = ?"  

From points 5 to 6: "isentrop -> n = k".  
p_6 = p_0 = 0.191 bar.  

The equation is written:  
T_6 divided by T_5 equals (p_6 divided by p_5) raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k).  

This leads to:  
T_6 equals T_5 multiplied by (p_6 divided by p_5) raised to the power of (k minus 1 divided by k).  

Values are substituted:  
T_6 equals 431.9 K multiplied by (0.191 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4).  

Result:  
T_6 equals 328.075 K.
