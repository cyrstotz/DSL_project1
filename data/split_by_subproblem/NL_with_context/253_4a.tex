A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points:  
- Point 1 at the lower left.  
- Points 2 and 4 along a curve.  
- Point 3 above the curve.  
Arrows indicate transitions between these points:  
- From point 1 to point 2/4 along the curve.  
- From point 2/4 to point 3 vertically upward.
