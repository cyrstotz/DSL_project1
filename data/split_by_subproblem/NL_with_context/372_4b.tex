The following equations and notes are written:  

1. \( Q = \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_1) = \dot{W} \)  
2. \( s_3 = s_3' = s_{2,3} \)  
3. \( T_i = 20^\circ C = 293.15 \, K \)  

Additional crossed-out content includes equations and notes related to \( \dot{m} \), \( h_{2,1} \), and \( s_{2,3} \).  

No further readable content is present.
