A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [k/kgÂ·K]". The graph represents a thermodynamic process with labeled points and transitions:  
- Point 1 to Point 2: "adiabat rev"  
- Point 2 to Point 3: "isobar"  
- Point 3 to Point 5: "adiabat rev"  
- Point 5 to Point 6: "adiabat rev isentrop"  
- Point 6: "P6 = P0"  
- Point 5: "P5 = Pk = P1"  
- Point 3: "Mischkammer isobar"  
The graph includes dashed lines and arrows indicating the direction of the process.
