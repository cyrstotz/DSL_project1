A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the y-axis labeled in bar and Pascal, and temperature (T) on the x-axis labeled in Kelvin [K]. The graph shows phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). The critical point is marked on the curve separating the liquid and gas regions. The triple point is labeled where the solid, liquid, and gas phases meet. Two processes are indicated: "Isobar gefroren" (isobaric freezing) and "Isotherm druckabnahme" (isothermal pressure reduction).
