R equals R bar divided by M equals 83.14 divided by 50 equals 166.28 joules per kilogram Kelvin.  

P EW equals P zero plus F divided by A equals 1 bar plus m K times g times pi divided by 4 times D squared equals 1.276 bar.  

P g,1 equals P g equals P EW equals 1.297 bar.  

V 1 equals 3.19 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.  
T 1 equals 773.15 Kelvin.  

m g equals P g times V 1 divided by R times T 1 equals 0.037126 kilograms.
