A graph is drawn with pressure labeled as "p [bar]" on the y-axis and temperature labeled as "T [°C]" on the x-axis. The graph shows three distinct regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous). A curve is drawn, marking the transition between these regions. The curve includes two points labeled "(i)" and "(ii)", with "(i)" near the triple point labeled "Tripel".
