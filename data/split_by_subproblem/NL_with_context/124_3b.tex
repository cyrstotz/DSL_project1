Since \( x > 0 \), not all ice has melted in the equilibrium state. Therefore, the ice-water mixture is at equilibrium temperature \( 0^\circ \text{C} \).  

The pressure in this case is independent of the gas and depends only on the mass of the water/ice, the weight, and the external pressure, which remains constant without mass exchange.
