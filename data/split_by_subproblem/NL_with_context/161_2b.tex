\( p_g = p_{EW} \)  
\( T_{g,2} = T_{EW} \)  

EW is incompressible, the pressure in EW does not change with \( x_{EW} \).  
\( \Rightarrow \) The pressure in EW remains constant and therefore does not change \( \Rightarrow \) pressure in gas does not change \( \Rightarrow p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \).  

\( T_{g,2} = T_{EW} \) because EW and gas are in equilibrium \( \Rightarrow T_{EW,2} = T_{g,2} \).  

\( T_{EW} = 0^\circ \text{C} \) because \( T_{EW} = 0^\circ \text{C} \) as EW is a mixture of solid and liquid.
