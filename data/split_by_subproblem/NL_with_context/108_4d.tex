E_K = Q_K divided by W_K  

E_K = Q_K divided by (W_K plus Q_K)  

Energy balance equation for evaporator:  
0 = ṁ multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1) plus Q̇_K  

From part c:  
h_2 = 234.08 kilojoules per kilogram (Table A-10)  

Q̇_K = ṁ multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1)  
Q̇_K = 0.005 kilograms per second multiplied by (234.08 kilojoules per kilogram minus 93.62 kilojoules per kilogram)  
Q̇_K = 0.146 kilowatts  

E_K = Q̇_K divided by (Q̇_K plus W_K)  
E_K = 0.005
