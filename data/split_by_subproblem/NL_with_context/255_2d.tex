Stationary flow process  

Delta exergy loss equals delta exergy stream plus delta exergy heat minus work turbine.  
Work turbine equals zero, as the entire power of the turbine goes into the compressors!  

Delta exergy heat equals open parenthesis one minus T zero divided by T B close parenthesis times q B equals 969.58 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Exergy loss equals 7710.38 kilojoules per kilogram.
