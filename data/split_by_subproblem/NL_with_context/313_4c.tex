x equals  

The throttle is adiabatic and does not perform work.  
Zero equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy two minus enthalpy one). Therefore, temperature four equals temperature one.  
Enthalpy four equals enthalpy one.  

h4 equals 53.42 kilojoules per kilogram (from Table A-11) equals h1.  
Temperature four equals temperature one equals 31.33 degrees Celsius.  

p2 minus p1 equals 6.08 bar.  

At minus 22 degrees Celsius, x equals 1.  

p2 equals (6.4566 bar minus 5.716 bar) divided by (24 degrees Celsius minus 20 degrees Celsius) multiplied by (22 degrees Celsius minus 20 degrees Celsius) plus 5.716 bar equals 6.05830 bar.
