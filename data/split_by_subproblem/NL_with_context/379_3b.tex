\( x_{\text{Eis,2}} > 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad T_{g,2} = T_{\text{EW,2}} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  

Thermal equilibrium: \( Q = 0 \quad \Delta T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} = T_{\text{EW}} \)  

\( p_{g,2} \): The weight on the piston does not change.  
\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} = 1.400942 \, \text{bar} \)  

Explanation: Since the ice content is greater than zero, this means the ice-water temperature remains constant, and in state 2, no heat transfer exists anymore. The second gas temperature must therefore be \( 0^\circ \text{C} \). Additionally, the pressure of the gas remains constant because the piston force remains constant.
