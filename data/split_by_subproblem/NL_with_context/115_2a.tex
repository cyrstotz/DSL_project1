f subscript y divided by f subscript y equals 1 plus f subscript y minus f subscript y divided by f subscript y minus f subscript y.

Two diagrams are drawn on the page:

1. **Top Diagram**:  
   - The graph is labeled with "T" on the vertical axis and "s" on the horizontal axis.  
   - There is a curve that rises steeply and then loops back downward.  
   - Points labeled "1", "2", and "3" are marked along the curve.  
   - Arrows indicate transitions between these points.  
   - The title above the diagram reads "Kreisprozess" (cycle process).

2. **Bottom Diagram**:  
   - The graph is labeled with "T [K]" on the vertical axis and "[kJ/kg K]" on the horizontal axis.  
   - A curve starts at the bottom left and rises steeply, then transitions into a smoother curve with labeled points "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", and "6".  
   - Arrows indicate transitions between these points.  
   - A note near point "1" reads "Triple Temp als u" (triple temperature as u).  
   - The horizontal axis is labeled "[kJ/kg K]".

\[ w_6 = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot \dot{m}_K \cdot (h_5 - h_6)}{\dot{m}_M}} \]  

\[ h_6 = h_5 - \frac{w_5^2}{2} \cdot \frac{\dot{m}_M}{\dot{m}_K} \]  

\[ w_6 = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot \dot{m}_K \cdot (h_5 - h_6)}{\dot{m}_M}} \]  

Entropy balance:  
\[ \dot{S}_{erz} = \dot{S}_{in} - \dot{S}_{out} \]  

\[ \dot{S}_{erz} = \frac{\dot{Q}_R}{T_R} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{out}}{T_{KF}} \]  

Energy balance:  
\[ \dot{Q}_R + \dot{m}_K \cdot h_5 + \dot{m}_M \cdot h_5 = \dot{m}_K \cdot h_6 + \dot{m}_M \cdot h_6 + \dot{Q}_{out} \]  

\[ \dot{Q}_R = \dot{Q}_{out} \]  

\[ \dot{Q}_{out} = \dot{m}_K \cdot (h_5 - h_6) + \dot{m}_M \cdot (h_5 - h_6) \]
