The equation for the mass flow rate of R134a is written as:  
\( \dot{m} \cdot (h_2 - h_3) + Q_{23} - \dot{W}_K \).  
The term \( Q_{23} \) is crossed out, and the process is labeled as "adiabatic."  

Additional notes:  
- \( s_2 = s_3 \).  
- \( p_3 = p_4 \).  
- \( h_2 = h_f + x_2 \cdot (h_g - h_f) \).  
- \( h_2 = h_f \), with the condition \( 1 \leq x_2 \leq 1 \).  
- \( h_3 = h(8 \, \text{bar}) \).
