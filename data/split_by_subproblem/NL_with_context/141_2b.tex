The task involves determining the velocity \( w_6 \) and temperature \( T_6 \).  

The following text is written:  
"Given data:  
\( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)."  

A crossed-out equation is present, and the text continues:  
"Assumptions:  
\( \dot{m}_{\text{in}} = \dot{m}_{\text{out}} \) (mass conservation).  
\( p \cdot V^n = \text{constant} \)."
