The area of the cylinder is calculated as:  
A sub cylinder equals 0.1 meters squared times pi equals 0.0314 meters squared.  

The pressure is given as:  
p equals N divided by meters squared.  

The external force is calculated as:  
F sub external equals 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 0.0314 meters squared plus 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared equals 3455.5 newtons.  

The force on the piston is:  
F sub piston times A sub cylinder equals 3455.5 newtons.  

The pressure of the gas is:  
p sub gas equals 1.1 bar.  

The molar mass is:  
M equals 50 kilograms per kilomole.  

The gas constant is:  
R equals R bar divided by M equals 166.28 joules per kilogram kelvin.  

The mass of the gas is calculated as:  
p times V divided by R times T equals m sub g1 equals 2.687 grams.
