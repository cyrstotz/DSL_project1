A table is presented with columns labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 0. Rows are labeled as follows:  

- **T**:  
  - Column 5: 431.8 K  
  - Column 6: 318.075 K  
  - Column 0: 293.15 K / 30  

- **p**:  
  - Column 5: 5.10^4 Pa  
  - Column 6: 1.91^4 Pa  
  - Column 0: 1.91^4 Pa  

- **h**: (no values provided)  

- **s**: (no values provided)  

- **w**:  
  - Column 5: 220 m/s  
  - Column 6: 502.2 m/s  
  - Column 0: 200  

Below the table, the following text is written:  
**Luft**  
w_Luft = 200 m/s  
m_geo = ? kg/s  
n = 1.4  
c_p = 1.006 kJ/kg·K = 1006 J/kg·K  

A diagram labeled **a)** is drawn. It is a T-s diagram with the following features:  
- The vertical axis is labeled T (K).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled s (1/kg·K).  
- Points are marked as 0, 2, G, S, 5, and 6.  
- A curve connects these points, starting at 0 and moving through 2, G, S, 5, and ending at 6.  
- The point labeled p_0 is marked near the horizontal axis.
