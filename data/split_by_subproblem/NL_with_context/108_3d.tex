x EW equals x two.  
T two EW equals T zero equals 0.003 degrees Celsius.  
p two EW equals 9.46 bar.  

m EW times E-Bil: Delta U EW one two equals Q one two.  
Delta U one two EW equals m EW times (U two minus U one).  

U two equals U one plus Q one two divided by m EW equals negative 708.29 kJ/kg.  

x two equals U two minus U ice divided by U ice minus U water.  
U ice equals negative 0.333 L5 kJ/kg, U water equals negative 333.62 kJ/kg.  

x two equals 0.568.  
x two less than x EW checkmark.
