A diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as 'T [K]' (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as 's [kJ/K]' (entropy in kilojoules per Kelvin).  

The diagram represents a T-s process with several states labeled:  
- State 1 to State 2 is marked as 'isentrop'.  
- State 2 to State 3 is marked as 'isobar'.  
- State 3 to State 4 is marked as 'isentrop'.  
- State 4 to State 5 is marked as 'isobar'.  
- State 5 to State 6 is marked as 'isentrop'.  

Additional labels:  
- 'p3 = p4' is written near states 3 and 4.  
- 'p5' is written near state 5.  
- 'p0 (isobare)' is written near state 6.
