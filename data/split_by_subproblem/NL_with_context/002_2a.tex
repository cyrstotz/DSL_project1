Air as a perfect gas  

A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as [K] (temperature) and the x-axis labeled as [kJ/kgÂ·K] (entropy). The graph shows a T-s diagram with labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left  
- Point 1 connected to Point 2 with a curved line  
- Point 2 connected to Point 3 with a straight line  
- Point 3 connected to Point 4 with a curved line  
- Point 4 connected to Point 5 with a straight line  
- Point 5 connected to Point 6 with a curved line  

Two isobars are drawn as red lines, labeled \( p_z = p_3 \) (upper isobar) and \( p_6 = p_0 \) (lower isobar).
