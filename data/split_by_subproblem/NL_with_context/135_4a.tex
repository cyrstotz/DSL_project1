A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a phase diagram with labeled points:  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 2 is slightly higher and to the right of Point 1.  
- Point 3 is at the top right.  
- Point 4 is at the top left.  
- Point 5 is in the middle of the curve.  

The curve connects these points, representing different states in the process. The regions are shaded to indicate phase transitions.
