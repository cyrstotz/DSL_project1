A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph represents a thermodynamic process with six points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Point 0 is at the bottom left.  
- Points 1, 2, and 3 show an upward trend, with point 3 being the peak.  
- Points 4, 5, and 6 show a downward trend, with point 6 returning close to the x-axis.  
- The isobars are labeled as \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_1 = p_5 = p_4 \), and \( p_0 = p_6 \).  
- The word "Isobaren" (isobars) is written near the dashed lines connecting the points.
