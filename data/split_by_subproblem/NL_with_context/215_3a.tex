p times V equals R times T  
R equals R bar divided by M equals 0.16628 joules per kelvin per gram  
p times V equals m times R times T  
m equals p divided by R  
p from F above: p equals F divided by A  
pi times r squared equals pi times 0.05 squared equals 0.0078 square meters  

F equals m times g  
32 plus 0.1 equals 374.9 newtons  
Therefore, p equals F divided by A equals 40 kilopascals  
p gas equals p ambient plus p equals 1.4 bar
