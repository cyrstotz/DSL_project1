Energy balance (stationary flow process):  

0 equals m dot multiplied by (h zero minus h six plus w Luft squared minus w six squared divided by 2) plus q B multiplied by m K  

m K equals m M divided by 5.293  

h zero equals h of T zero equals h of 243.15 K  

From Table A2:  
h of 243.15 equals h of 240 plus (h of 250 minus h of 240) divided by (250 minus 240) multiplied by (243.15 minus 240)  

h zero equals approximately 243.18 kilojoules per kilogram  

h six equals h of 430 plus (h of 440 minus h of 430) divided by (440 minus 430) multiplied by (471.9 minus 430)  

h six equals approximately 433.37 kilojoules per kilogram  

w six equals w zero  

Therefore:  
0 equals m dot multiplied by (w Luft squared minus w six squared divided by 2) plus q B multiplied by m K  

w six equals the square root of (2 multiplied by q B multiplied by m K divided by m dot plus w Luft squared)
