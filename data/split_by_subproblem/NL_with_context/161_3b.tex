p g2 equals p g1 and T g2 equals T g1  

Membrane and piston are friction-free (and they can move obviously).  
The pressure in the gas chamber is always equal to the pressure in the EW chamber, and the pressure in the EW chamber is always equal to the pressure in the gas chamber.  

EW is incompressible.
