A graph is drawn with pressure (P in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a curve labeled with points 1, 2, 3, and 4. There is a shaded region labeled "II" and another region labeled "I". The curve represents the phase regions in the freeze-drying process.
