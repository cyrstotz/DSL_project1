Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure versus temperature (p-T) graph with a curve labeled "Ti" and annotations indicating phase regions. The curve shows oscillations and transitions between phases.  
2. The second diagram is another p-T graph with regions labeled "Gas/Fest" (gas/solid) and "Flüssig" (liquid). A line separates the regions, and "Ti" is marked on the graph.  

Below the diagrams:  
- Ti = -10°C  
- Pressure (p_i) = 1 mbar  
- Temperature boiling water = -16°C
