A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the y-axis labeled as "p [bar]". The graph shows a curve starting from the bottom left and rising upwards. The regions are labeled as follows:  
- "Solid-Dampf" (solid-vapor) is written near the lower part of the curve.  
- "Dampf" (vapor) is written near the upper part of the curve.  
- A point on the curve is labeled "Tripel" (triple point).
