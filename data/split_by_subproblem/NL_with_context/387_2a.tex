A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T (u)" and the x-axis labeled as "s (u) / us(u)." The graph represents a T-s diagram with several points and curves labeled:  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked.  
- Isobars are labeled as \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( p_4 \), and \( p_5 \).  
- The curves show transitions between states, with dashed lines indicating isobaric processes and solid lines indicating other transitions.
