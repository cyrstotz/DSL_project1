Energy balance around the compressor:  
0 equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 3) plus heat flow minus work rate.  
Work rate equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 3).  

Enthalpy at state 2:  
u2 equals ug at 40 degrees Celsius equals 226.27 (from Table A-10).  
Temperature inside the freeze dryer: Ti equals 0 degrees Celsius plus 10 degrees Celsius equals 10 degrees Celsius.  

Entropy at state 2 equals entropy at state 3 (isentropic):  
s2 equals sg at 40 degrees Celsius equals 0.9169.  
Interpolation at 8 bar:  
s2 equals sf plus x multiplied by (sg minus sf).  
x3 equals 0.334 (from Table A-12).  

Enthalpy at state 3:  
u3 equals uf plus x multiplied by (ug minus uf) at 40 degrees Celsius.  

Mass flow rate:  
mass flow rate equals work rate divided by (enthalpy at state 2 minus enthalpy at state 3).
