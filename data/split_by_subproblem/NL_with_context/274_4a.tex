p-T Diagram, Step i and ii  

A graph is drawn with pressure (p, in bar) on the y-axis and temperature (T, in Kelvin) on the x-axis. The diagram includes labeled points:  
- Point 1  
- Point 2  
- Point 3  
- Point 4  

The curve represents the phase regions and transitions.

Ek equals Qzw divided by w dot equals Qk minus Qzw divided by w dot equals Qzw divided by Qab minus Qzw equals Qk divided by Qab minus Qk.  

Qk equals m dot R134a multiplied by (h2 minus h1).  
Qk equals 205.79 kilojoules.  

Qab equals m dot R134a multiplied by (h4 minus h3).  
Qab equals -156.29.  

Ek equals Qk divided by w dot equals 7349.64.
