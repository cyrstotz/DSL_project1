A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows phase regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas).  
- The curve transitions from the solid phase to the liquid phase and then to the gas phase.  
- Two processes are marked:  
  - "i" is labeled as "isobar" and shows a vertical line from point 1 to point 2.  
  - "ii" is labeled as "isotherm" and shows a horizontal line from point 3 to the curve.
