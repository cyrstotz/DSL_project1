Force law:  
Since EW is incompressible:  
p_g,1 = p_amb + A times m_K times g  

A = (D divided by 2 squared) times pi  

p_g,1 = 1.3897 bar  

m_g: Ideal gas law:  
p times V = m times R times T  

m = p times V divided by R times T  

m_g = p_g,1 times V_g,1 divided by R times T_g,1  

R = R divided by M = 166.28 divided by 50 = 3.3256 kg times m squared divided by s squared divided by K times kmol  

m_g = 3.478 g
