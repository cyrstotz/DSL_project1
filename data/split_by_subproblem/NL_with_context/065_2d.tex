Exergy loss equals T0 multiplied by S entropy production.  

Exergy loss equals T0 multiplied by delta entropy stream minus T0 multiplied by (s zero minus s six) equals T0 multiplied by (s zero (Tc) minus s zero (T0)) minus R multiplied by ln (p zero divided by p six).  

Exergy loss equals 243.15 Kelvin multiplied by (1.97915 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin minus 1.49111 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin) minus R multiplied by ln (p zero divided by p six).  

Exergy loss equals 73.42 kilojoules per kilogram.
