The equation is written:  
dF/dt = m dot (h in - h out) + Q + W  

Another equation is written:  
Q = m dot (h2 - h3) + W  

Below this, the following is written:  
h2 = h g (T2)  
T2 = -6°C  
p3 = 8 bar

Further calculations are shown:  
h g (4) = 244.9 kJ/kg  
h g (8) = 292.54 kJ/kg  

h2 = 292.54 + (-8 + 8) / (-4 - 8) (244.9 - 292.54)  
= 245.72 kJ/kg  

s2 = 0.9258 + (8 - 6) / (8 - 4) (0.9239 - 0.9258)  
= 0.9226 kJ/kg·K
