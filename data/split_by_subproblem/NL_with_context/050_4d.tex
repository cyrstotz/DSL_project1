The coefficient of performance (COP) of the cooling cycle is expressed as:  
ε_K = absolute value of Q̇_zu divided by (absolute value of Q̇_zu minus absolute value of Q̇_ab) = absolute value of Q̇_K divided by Ẇ_K = (blank space for calculation).  

The heat transfer rate is given by:  
Q̇_K = ṁ multiplied by (h_2 minus h_1).
