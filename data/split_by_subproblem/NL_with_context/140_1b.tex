T KF equals integral from S in to S out of T dS divided by (S out minus S in)  

S out equals S f at 15 degrees Celsius equals 0.2245 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (from Table A2)  

S in equals S f at 25 degrees Celsius equals 0.3674 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (from Table A2)  

T KF equals (T KF in minus T KF out) divided by (S out minus S in) equals 70 degrees Celsius
