A graph is drawn with pressure (p in mbar) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in degrees Celsius) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes the following annotations:  
- A curve labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point).  
- A horizontal line labeled "isotherm" (isothermal).  
- A vertical line labeled "isobar eingelegen" (isobar inserted).  
Points are marked as 2, 3, and a lower point on the curve.
