A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points and processes:  
- Point 0 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 by an adiabatic, reversible, isentropic process.  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 by an isochoric process.  
- Point 3 is connected to point 4 by an adiabatic, irreversible process.  
- Point 4 is connected to point 5 by an isochoric process.  
- Point 5 is connected to point 6 by an isentropic process.  
- The diagram includes arrows indicating the direction of processes and labels such as "adiabat, reversible, isentrop," "isochore," and "adiabat irreversible."  
- The axes are labeled: the vertical axis is "T [K]" and the horizontal axis is "s [kJ/kg·K]."

\( T_0 = 283.15 \, \text{K} \)  

\( \Delta ex_{str} = (85.493 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 283.15 \, \text{K} \cdot (0.303 \, \text{kJ/kg·K}) + \frac{(857.294 \, \text{m/s})^2}{2} - \frac{(200 \, \text{m/s})^2}{2}) \)  

\( = 85.493 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 73.772 \, \text{kJ/kg} + 123.688 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 257.296 \, \text{kJ/kg} - 70 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)  

\( = -120.005 \, \text{kJ/kg} \)
