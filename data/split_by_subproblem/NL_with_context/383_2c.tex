Delta exergy of the stream equals mass-specific exergy flow rate times the difference between h6 minus h0 minus T0 times (s6 minus s0).  

s6 minus s0 equals s0 at T6 minus s0 at T0 minus R times the natural logarithm of p6 divided by p0.  

The term R times the natural logarithm of p6 divided by p0 equals zero.  

h6 minus h0 equals 189.88 kilojoules per kilogram (from subtask b).
