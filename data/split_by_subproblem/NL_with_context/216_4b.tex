The heading reads "in adiabatic compression process 2-3".  

An equation is written:  
Q equals m multiplied by (h e minus h a) plus ke plus pe plus Q minus W.  

Another equation is written:  
W equals m multiplied by (h e minus h a) equals m multiplied by (h2 minus h3).  

A formula is written:  
m equals W divided by (h2 minus h3).  

Two placeholders are written:  
h2 equals  
h3 equals
