A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a curve labeled "Nassdampf" (wet steam) and includes two marked points:  
- "TP" (triple point) at the peak of the curve.  
- "(ii)" near the right side of the curve.  
The curve transitions into a region labeled "gas" beyond the peak.
