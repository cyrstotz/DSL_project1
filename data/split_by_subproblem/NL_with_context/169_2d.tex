Summation of e_x,str equals summation of (1 minus T_c divided by T) multiplied by Q dot minus summation of W dot in minus summation of e_x,verl.  

e_x,verl equals T_0 divided by T multiplied by S_erz.  

S_erz equals minus Delta e_x,str divided by T_c, since the process is adiabatic and reversible.  

C equals minus Delta e_x,str plus summation of (1 minus T_c divided by T) multiplied by Q dot equals summation of W dot in minus e_x,verl.  

e_x,verl equals minus Delta e_x,str equals minus 207.48 kilojoules per kilogram.
