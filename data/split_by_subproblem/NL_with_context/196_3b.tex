\( x_{\text{Ice},2} > 0 \) â†’ Water is still in the solid-liquid phase.  

The temperature of the gas will be \( 0^\circ \, \text{C} \). The gas transfers heat to the water as long as the temperature of the gas is higher than that of the water.  

The pressure of the gas will be the same as in state 1. It must counteract the gravitational forces and the atmospheric pressure.
