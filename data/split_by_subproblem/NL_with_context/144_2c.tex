- wc = 5 multiplied by 10 raised to the power of 3.  
  TG = 340 Kelvin.  

- Exergy change formula:  
  Δexstr = hG minus h0 minus TG multiplied by (sG minus s0) plus wG squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2.  
  hG minus h0 = cp multiplied by (TG minus T0).  
  sG minus s0 = cp multiplied by ln(TG / T0).  
  Δexstr = cp multiplied by (TG minus T0) minus TG multiplied by cp multiplied by ln(TG / T0) plus wG squared divided by 2 minus w0 squared divided by 2.  
  Δexstr = 125.47 kilojoules per kilogram.
