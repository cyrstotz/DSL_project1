A diagram is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled "s in kJ/kgÂ·K".  
- The y-axis is labeled "T in K".  

The diagram shows several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Point 1 is labeled "adiabat".  
- Point 2 is labeled "isotrop".  
- Point 3 is labeled "adiabat".  
- Point 5 is labeled "isobar".  
- Point 6 is labeled "adiabat".  
- The curve at the top is labeled "p3 = p5".  
- The curve at the bottom is labeled "p0 = 0.15 bar".
