The equation for mass flow rate is written:  
m dot equals m gas times h six minus h five minus w six.  

A molar mass is given:  
M subscript L equals 28.07 grams per mole.  

The entropy equation is written:  
S six equals S five.  
S six minus S five equals zero.  
S equals c subscript p times ln (T subscript S divided by T subscript G) minus R divided by M subscript L times ln (P subscript S divided by P subscript G).  

Further simplifications are shown:  
T subscript G divided by T subscript S equals (P subscript G divided by P subscript S) raised to the power of kappa minus one divided by kappa.  
T subscript G equals 328.07 Kelvin.  

Velocity calculations are shown:  
w six squared divided by two equals h five minus h six plus w five squared divided by two.  
w six equals 507.24 meters per second.  

Additional notes:  
Adiabatic, reversible, and isentropic.  
w five equals zero.  
Q equals zero.
