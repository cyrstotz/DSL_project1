The page contains two diagrams labeled as "4a)" and titled "p-T".  

**First Diagram:**  
- The vertical axis is labeled "P [mbar]".  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "T [°C]".  
- The diagram shows a curve with three distinct regions labeled:  
  - "Flüssig" (Liquid)  
  - "T_tripel" (Triple Point)  
  - "Gas"  
- A point labeled "T_subl" is marked on the curve.  
- Another point labeled "T_i = 10°C" is shown on the horizontal axis.  
- The curve transitions from the liquid phase to the gas phase.  
- The text "Wasser in Lebensmittel" (Water in food) is written below the diagram.  

**Second Diagram:**  
- The vertical axis is labeled "P [mbar]".  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "T [°C]".  
- The diagram shows a smaller curve with two points labeled:  
  - "1"  
  - "2"  
- The point "T_trip" is marked on the curve.  
- A horizontal line labeled "T = const" connects the two points.  
- The point "T_i = 10°C" is marked on the horizontal axis.
