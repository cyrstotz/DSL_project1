Adiabatic and reversible process:  
- \( h_5 = h_6 \)  
- \( \dot{Q} = \dot{m} \left[ h_6 - h_0 + \frac{w_6^2 - w_0^2}{2} \right] \)  

Velocity calculation:  
- \( w_6^2 = w_5^2 - 2 \cdot \left( h_6 - h_5 \right) \)  
- \( w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot c_p \cdot \left( T_5 - T_6 \right) + w_5^2} \)  
- \( w_6 = \sqrt{2 \cdot c_p \cdot \left( T_5 - T_6 \right)} \)  
- \( w_6 = 507.25 \, \text{m/s} \)

exergy specific equals h six minus h zero minus T zero multiplied by (s six minus s zero) plus one-half multiplied by w six squared minus w zero squared divided by q.  

h six minus h zero equals the integral from T zero to T six of c p d T equals c p multiplied by (T six minus T zero).  

s six minus s zero equals the integral from T zero to T six of c p divided by T d T minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of p six divided by p zero equals c p multiplied by the natural logarithm of T six divided by T zero minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of p six divided by p zero.  

T zero equals 243.15 Kelvin.  

exergy specific equals 133.6 minus 2.7 divided by kilograms.  

s zero equals 243.15 Kelvin.  

s six equals c p multiplied by the natural logarithm of T six divided by T zero minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of p six divided by p zero equals c p multiplied by the natural logarithm of 330 Kelvin divided by 243.15 Kelvin minus R multiplied by the natural logarithm of 0.5 divided by 0.191 equals 2.7033 divided by kilograms Kelvin.
