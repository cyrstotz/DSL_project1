Energy balance for a closed system (gas):  
Delta E equals Q one-two minus W one-two.  

m gas times c V times (T two gas minus T one gas) equals Q one-two minus the integral from V one to V two of p d V.  

Q one-two equals m gas times c V times (T two gas minus T one gas) plus p two gas times (V two minus V one).  

Equals negative one point zero eight three two kilojoules plus one one four four point nine joules.  

Equals thirty-one point two one joules.  

Question mark (should be less than zero).  

V two equals (m gas times R divided by M) times T two divided by p two gas.  

Equals zero point zero zero four one one cubic meters.
