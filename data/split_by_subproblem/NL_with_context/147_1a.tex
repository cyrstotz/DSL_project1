a) Steady-state flow process:  
Zero equals mass flow rate of coolant multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at inlet plus velocity squared divided by two plus gravitational acceleration multiplied by the difference in height.  
Zero equals heat flow out of the reactor wall to the coolant.  

Steady-state reactor:  
Zero equals mass flow rate at inlet multiplied by the difference between enthalpy at exit and enthalpy at inlet plus velocity squared divided by two plus gravitational acceleration multiplied by the difference in height plus heat flow out plus reaction heat flow.  

Enthalpy values:  
Enthalpy at exit equals enthalpy at 70 degrees Celsius from table A-2 equals 292.98 kilojoules per kilogram.  
Enthalpy at inlet equals enthalpy at 100 degrees Celsius from table A-2 equals 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Heat flow out:  
Heat flow out equals 0.3 kilograms per second multiplied by the difference in enthalpy values (292.98 kilojoules per kilogram minus 419.04 kilojoules per kilogram) plus 100 kilowatts.  
Heat flow out equals 62.182 kilowatts.
