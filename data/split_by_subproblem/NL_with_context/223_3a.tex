T_g,1 equals 500 degrees Celsius, V_g,1 equals 3.14 liters, which is equal to 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.  
n equals 0.00334 cubic meters.  
c_V equals 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
M_g equals 50 kilograms per kilomole.  

Negative c_R equals R divided by M_g equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole Kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole equals 166.28 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Negative pV equals RT.  
Negative p equals R times T divided by V.  

Druckbilanz (Pressure balance):  
p_g equals m_K times g divided by pi times Sec squared plus 32 kilograms times g divided by pi times Sec squared plus 1 bar.  

p_g,1 equals 1 bar plus 0.128 bar plus 39.37 kilopascals equals 1.41 bar.  

m_g,1 equals R times T_1 divided by p_1 times V_1 equals 166.28 times 1 divided by 773.15 Kelvin divided by 1.15 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 0.00334 cubic meters equals 0.772.
