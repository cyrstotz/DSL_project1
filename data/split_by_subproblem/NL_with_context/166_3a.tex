The cylinder has an area A equal to pi times the diameter squared divided by 4, which is 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.  

p times V equals m times R times T.  

We do not know m and p.  

p times V equals m times R times T.  

p_g,1 times A equals m_EW times g plus m_K times g plus p_atm times A.  

p_g,1 equals m_EW times g divided by A plus m_K times g divided by A plus p_atm.  

p_g,1 equals ...  

m_g equals p_g times V_g,1 divided by R times T_g,1.  

R equals R divided by M_g equals 0.163 cubic meters per kilogram Kelvin.
