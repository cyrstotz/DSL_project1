(*) State 2 is a thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e., T_g2 equals T_EW,2.  
Since x_Eis,2 is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, T_EW,2 equals T_EW,1, i.e., T_g2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.

Consider energy balance around the gas:  
Closed system implies:  
Delta E equals Q subscript 12 minus W subscript V  

Isobaric process: p subscript g equals p subscript g1 implies W subscript V equals integral of p subscript g dV  
equals p subscript g1 times (V subscript 2 minus V subscript 1)  

Ideal gas implies:  
p subscript g1 times V subscript g1 divided by T subscript g1 equals p subscript g1 times V subscript g2 divided by T subscript g2  

V subscript g2 equals V subscript g1 times T subscript g2 divided by T subscript g1  

equals 3.14 times 273.153 divided by 773.15  
equals 1.10936 times 10 to the power of negative 3  

W subscript V equals 1.5 times 10 to the power of 5 times (1.10936 minus 3.14) times 10 to the power of negative 3  
equals negative 3.04596 times 10 to the power of 2  

Delta E equals m subscript g times c subscript V times (T subscript g2 minus T subscript g1)  

Ideal gas implies:  
Q subscript 12 equals 3.6 times 10 to the power of 3 times 0.633 times (273.153 minus 773.15)  
minus negative 3.04596 times 10 to the power of 2  

equals negative 1443.99
