PV equals mRT.  
R equals 854 J per mole per Kelvin divided by 50 kg per kilomole equals 16628 J per kilogram per Kelvin.  
A equals pi times (D divided by 2) squared equals 7.854 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.  

Pressure? Pressure EW:  
P_Eis equals m_K times g divided by A plus p_0 equals 1437.16 times 10 to the power of 5 Pascal equals 1.44 bar.  

=> Pressure gas:  
[m_K times g divided by A] plus p_0 equals P_g equals P_Eis plus m_B times g divided by A equals 1.44 bar minus p_g1.  

=> m: PV equals mRT.  
m equals PV divided by RT equals P_g1 times V_g1 divided by R times T_g1 equals 3.517 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms equals m_g.
