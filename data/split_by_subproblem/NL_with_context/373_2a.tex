A graph is drawn with the title "T-s Diagram."  

- The x-axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]."  
- The y-axis is labeled as "T [K]."  

The graph includes several curves and points:  
- Point 1 is at the lower left.  
- Point 2 is higher vertically, connected to Point 1 by a vertical line.  
- Point 3 is further to the right and higher than Point 2, connected by a curved line.  
- Point 5 is lower than Point 3 but to the right, connected by another curved line.  
- Point 6 is slightly lower than Point 5, connected by a dashed vertical line.  

The curves are labeled as follows:  
- "T_B" near the curve connecting Points 2 and 3.  
- "T_5" near the curve connecting Points 3 and 5.  
- "T_0" near the curve at the bottom right.
