A graph is drawn with the following details:  
- The y-axis is labeled \( T \) (temperature) in \( \text{K} \).  
- The x-axis is labeled \( s \) (entropy) in \( \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \).  
- The graph includes labeled isobars (constant pressure lines):  
  - \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - \( 1.0 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - \( 1.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
- Points are marked and connected with arrows:  
  - Point 0 (start)  
  - Point 1  
  - Point 2  
  - Point 3  
  - Point 4  
  - Point 5  
  - Point 6 (end)  

Additional labels:  
- "Isobars"  
- "Bentrop"  
- "Kennstront"
