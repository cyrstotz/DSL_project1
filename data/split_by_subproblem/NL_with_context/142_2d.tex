Specific heat capacity:  
- \( c_{p,Luft} = 1.006 \, \text{kJ/kgÂ·K} \)  

Heat transfer equation:  
- \( h_{6a} = \int_{T_5}^{T_6} c_p \, \text{dT} \)  
- \( h_{6a} = c_p \cdot \left( T_6 - T_5 \right) \)

exergy specific equals 100 divided by kilograms.  

O equals negative exergy specific plus (one minus T zero divided by T B) multiplied by q B plus exergy real.  

exergy real equals negative exergy specific plus (one minus T zero divided by T B) multiplied by q B equals negative 869.58 divided by kilograms.
