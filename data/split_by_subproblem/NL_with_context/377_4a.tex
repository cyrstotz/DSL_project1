A table is drawn with columns labeled T, P, V, x, W, and S.  
Rows are numbered 1 to 4.  
- Row 1: T and P are blank. x equals 1. W equals negative 28W. S equals 0.  
- Row 2: T and P are blank. x equals 1. W equals negative 28W. S equals 0.  
- Row 3: T equals 8. P equals blank. x equals blank. W equals crossed out. S equals blank.  
- Row 4: T and P are blank. x equals 0. W equals blank. S equals blank.  

S23 equals 0 (adiabatic reversible).  

A graph is drawn with axes labeled p [bar] and T [Â°C].  
- The graph shows a cycle with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- Between points 1 and 2: labeled "adiabatic reversible."  
- Between points 2 and 3: labeled "isobar."  
- Between points 3 and 4: labeled "adiabatic reversible."  
- Between points 4 and 1: labeled "isobar."  
- The pressure at point 1 is labeled as 8 bar.
