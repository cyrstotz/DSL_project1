A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. Three phase regions are labeled:  
- "Fest" (solid)  
- "Fl√ºssig" (liquid)  
- "Gas" (gas)  

Two processes are marked:  
- Process "i)" is a vertical line moving downward from the liquid region to the solid region.  
- Process "ii)" is a horizontal line moving leftward from the solid region to the gas region.
