The pressure \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \), as the piston does not change the mass and the ambient pressure remains unchanged.  

Since ice is still present (\( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \)) in state 2, the thermodynamic equilibrium means the temperature of the gas equals that of the ice-water mixture, which is 0Â°C or 273.15 K.
