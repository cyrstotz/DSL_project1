No work is applied, only the streams and heat flow.  

Exergy balance for the overall system (stationary):  
0 equals m dot gas times negative Delta exergy stream plus E dot x,QB minus E dot x,verl.  

E dot x,QB equals (1 minus T0 divided by TB) times Q dot B equals m dot K times (1 minus T0 divided by TB) times qB.  

m dot ges equals m dot i plus m dot M minus m dot K plus 5.293 times m dot K equals 6.293 times m dot K.  

m dot K equals m dot ges divided by 6.293.  

0 equals negative Delta exergy stream plus 1 divided by 6.293 times (1 minus T0 divided by TB) times qB minus exergy loss.  

exergy loss equals 1 divided by 6.293 times (1 minus T0 divided by TB) times qB minus Delta exergy stream equals 137.89 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy stream equals 19.78 kilojoules per kilogram.
