Delta exergy stream equals h_a minus h_e minus T_0 times (s_a minus s_e) plus (w_e squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2). This equals 232.33 joules per kilogram.  

T_0 times (s_a minus s_e) equals c_p times the natural logarithm of T_6 divided by T_0 minus R times the natural logarithm of p_c divided by p_0. This equals 58.373 joules per kilogram.  

h_a minus h_e equals c_p times delta T. This equals 65.37 joules per kilogram.  

w_0 equals 200 meters per second.  

Delta kinetic energy equals 108.652 joules.  

It is calculated with 700 liters per kilogram.
