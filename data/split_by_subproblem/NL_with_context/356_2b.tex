w6 and T6 = ?  
w5 = 220 meters per second  
p0 = pc = 0.191 bar  
p5 = 0.5 bar  
T5 = 431.9 Kelvin  

Ideal gas =>  
T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n  

=> T6 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4 multiplied by T5  
=> T6 equals 328.0746568 Kelvin
