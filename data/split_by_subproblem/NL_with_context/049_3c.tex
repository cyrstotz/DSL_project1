This is an isobaric change, meaning p equals constant.  
Using the first law of thermodynamics:  
Delta U equals Q minus W implies Q equals Delta U plus W.  
Delta U equals m g times c V times Delta T, and p times Delta V equals 1772.275 J.  

Additionally, Delta V equals (V 2 minus V 1) equals (R T divided by p) minus (crossed-out terms) equals 0.002.
