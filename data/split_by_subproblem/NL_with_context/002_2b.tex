Energy balance around the engine  

A schematic diagram is drawn showing the flow of energy.  

Equations:  
\( T_G = T_B \cdot \left( \frac{p_6}{p_5} \right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \)  
\( T_G = 325.07 \, \text{K} \)  
\( n = 1.4 \)  

Energy balance:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_0 - h_1) + q_B - w_e - w_{a1} \)  
\( 0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_0 - h_1) + q_B - w_e - w_{a1} \)  
\( 0 = \dot{m} \cdot (h_0 - h_1) + (w_e - w_{a1})^2 + q_B \)  
\( 2 \cdot (h_0 - h_1) = q_B + (w_e - w_{a1})^2 \)

O equals open bracket h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 plus w subscript k squared divided by 2 minus w subscript 5 squared divided by 2 close bracket plus arrow pointing to zero.

z equals w subscript e squared divided by 2 equals z open bracket h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 close bracket plus w subscript r squared divided by 2 equals c subscript p multiplied by open parenthesis T subscript 5 minus T subscript 6 close parenthesis plus u subscript h squared divided by 2.

w subscript 6 equals square root of 2 multiplied by 1.006 multiplied by open parenthesis 431.9 grams Kelvin minus 32.9 close parenthesis plus 220 squared divided by meters squared per second.
