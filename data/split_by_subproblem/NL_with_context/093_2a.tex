A graph is drawn representing a T-s diagram. The graph includes labeled isobars:  
- '30 bar'  
- '50 bar'  
- 'p0'  

The graph shows several points connected by curves:  
- Point '0' at the bottom left.  
- Point '1' connected to '0' by a curve labeled 'rev.'  
- Point '2' connected to '1' by a curve.  
- Point '3' connected to '2' by a curve.  
- Point '6' connected to '3' by a curve.
