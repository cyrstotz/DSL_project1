A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph shows six states labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Curves are drawn to represent isobars, labeled as \( p_0 \), \( p_2/p_3 \), and \( p_5 \). The states are connected with arrows indicating transitions between them.
