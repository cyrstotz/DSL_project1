T equals the integral from s a to s e of T d s divided by (s a minus s e), which equals q rev divided by (s a minus s e), which equals (h aus minus h ein) divided by (s aus minus s ein).  
This equals c multiplied by (T aus minus T ein) plus v i multiplied by (p aus minus p ein) divided by the natural logarithm of (T aus divided by T ein).  
This equals (T aus minus T ein) divided by the natural logarithm of (T aus divided by T ein).  
This equals (298.15 K minus 288.15 K) divided by the natural logarithm of (298.15 K divided by 288.15 K).  
This equals 293.12 K.
