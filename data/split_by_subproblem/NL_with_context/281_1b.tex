T mean equals the integral from s e to s a of T d s divided by (s a minus s e), which equals delta u divided by delta s.  

s e in (70 degrees Celsius, x equals zero) equals 0.9549.  
s a out (100 degrees Celsius, x equals zero) equals 1.7069.  

T mean equals (419.04 minus 292.98) divided by (1.3069 minus 0.9549), which equals 358.125 Kelvin.
