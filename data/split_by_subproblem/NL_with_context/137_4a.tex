A diagram is drawn with axes labeled \( p \) (pressure) on the vertical axis and \( T \) (temperature in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis.  
- The diagram includes two horizontal lines labeled "process von i)" and "process von ii)" respectively.  
- The upper horizontal line is labeled \( i \) and the lower horizontal line is labeled \( ii \).  
- An arrow pointing downward between the two lines is labeled "process von ii)".  
- The upper horizontal line is marked as "isobar".
