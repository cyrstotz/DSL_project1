A diagram is drawn showing a T-s graph with labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 slightly above and to the right of Point 0.  
- Point 2 further to the right of Point 1.  
- Point 3 above Point 2.  
- Point 4 further to the right of Point 3.  
- Point 5 above Point 4.  
- Point 6 at the top right.  

The graph includes two isobars labeled \( P_0 \) and \( P_5 \).
