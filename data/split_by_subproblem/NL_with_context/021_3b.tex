Using the first law of thermodynamics: \( AU = PF - Q_{12} \)  

The temperature of the gas is lower than \( T_r \), as this is necessary to melt the ice. The pressure also decreases as the temperature decreases.  

The direct heat transfer remains constant for \( m_{EW} \), as the temperature changes.
