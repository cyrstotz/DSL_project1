A schematic diagram of a system is drawn, showing three states labeled 2, 3, and an arrow pointing to \( W_K \). Below the diagram, the following equations are written:  
\( O = \dot{m} (h_2 - h_3) - \dot{W}_K \)  
\( \dot{W}_K / (h_2 - h_3) = \dot{m} \)  

Additional notes:  
\( h_2 \)  
\( h_3 (8 \, \text{bar}) = \)  
\( s_2 = s_B \)  
\( s_3 \)  
\( s_3 \, \text{superheated} \)  
\( s_3 (8 \, \text{bar}) = \)  
\( \text{TAB 12} \)
