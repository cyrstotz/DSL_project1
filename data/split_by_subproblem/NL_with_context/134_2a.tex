A graph is drawn with the title "T-S [°C]". The x-axis is labeled "S [kJ/kg·K]" and the y-axis is labeled "T [°C]". The graph shows a thermodynamic process with labeled points: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The curve between points 1 and 2 is marked "isentrop".  
- The curve between points 2 and 3 is marked "isobar".  
- The curve between points 5 and 6 is marked "isobar ps = p6".  
- The curve between points 3 and 4 is marked "isobar".  
- The curve between points 4 and 5 is marked "isentrop".  
The graph visually represents the thermodynamic process of a jet engine.
