**T-s Diagram**  
A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 'S [kJ/kg·K]'. The diagram includes several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Point 0 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 via an isentropic line.  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 via an isobaric line labeled 'p2 = p3'.  
- Point 3 is connected to point 4 via an isentropic line.  
- Point 4 is connected to point 5 via an isobaric line.  
- Point 5 is connected to point 6 via an isentropic line.  
- The surrounding pressure is labeled as 'p0 low?' near point 0.  
- The diagram includes dashed lines indicating isobars and isentropic processes.  

**Table of Values**  
A table is drawn with two columns labeled 'T [K]' and 'p [bar]'. The rows are labeled as follows:  
1. Isentropic → T = 243.15, p = 0.191  
2. Isentropic → (crossed out text)  
3. Isobaric → T = 200  
4. (Arrow pointing downward)  
5. T = 431.9, p = 0.5  
6. T = 314.48, p = 0.191  

**Additional Notes**  
- cp = 1.006  
- κ = 1.4

Plug into energy balance equation:  
Two times h sub c minus h sub o equals w sub c squared plus w sub out squared.  

Arrow points to:  
Two times h sub c minus h sub o minus w sub out squared equals w sub c squared.  

Calculation:  
202 squared divided by 2 minus 5.8 minus 7.9 equals w sub c.  

Result:  
w sub c equals 202.67 meters per second.
