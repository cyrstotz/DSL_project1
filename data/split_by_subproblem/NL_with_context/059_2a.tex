A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "s" and the y-axis labeled as "T". The graph includes several curves labeled as "isobare" (isobars) with specific values such as "0.5 bar" and "0.191 bar". Points are marked on the graph as "0", "1", "2", "3", "5", and "6". The curve between points "1" and "5" is labeled "isentrop". The curve between points "5" and "6" is labeled "adiabat". The temperature at point "0" is marked as approximately "-30Â°C".
