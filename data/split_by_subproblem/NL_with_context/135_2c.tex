Delta exergy equals exergy six minus exergy zero.  
Equals (h six minus h zero minus T zero multiplied by (s six minus s zero)) plus w six squared divided by two minus w zero squared divided by two.  
Equals c p multiplied by (T six minus T zero) minus T zero multiplied by (c p multiplied by ln(T six divided by T zero) minus R multiplied by ln(p six divided by p zero)) plus w six squared divided by two minus w zero squared divided by two.  

T six equals 328.075 kelvin.  
T zero equals 243.75 kelvin.  
c p equals 1.006.  
w six equals 502.2 meters per second.  
w zero equals 200 meters per second.  

Delta exergy equals 120.8 kilojoules per kilogram.
