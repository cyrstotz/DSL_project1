The pressure remains constant \( p_{1,3} = p_{2,3} \), as the temperature changes but simultaneously the volume also changes since the mass presses downward.

\[
\Delta U = \dot{m} \cdot Q_{12} \quad \text{First Law of Thermodynamics}
\]

\[
Q_{12} = m \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]

\[
Q_{12} = 3.6 \, \text{kg} \cdot c_V \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]
