A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph shows a thermodynamic process with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  
- The process between points 0 and 1 is marked as "isentrop".  
- The process between points 1 and 2 is marked as "isobar p = 0.1916 bar".  
- The process between points 2 and 3 is marked as "isobar".  
- The process between points 3 and 4 is marked as "isobar".  
- The process between points 4 and 5 is marked as "isobar".  
- The process between points 5 and 6 is marked as "adiabatic reversible".
