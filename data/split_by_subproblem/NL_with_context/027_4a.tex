A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as P (pressure) and F (phase). The diagram shows phase regions for gas, solid, and liquid.  
- The solid region is labeled "Solid is lower (under TP)" with an arrow pointing to the left of the triple point (TP).  
- The liquid region is labeled "isobar (frozen)" with a horizontal line extending from the TP.  
- The gas region is labeled "water curves back."  
- The TP (triple point) is marked clearly on the diagram.
