Delta S equals m total multiplied by (s2 minus s1) equals m total multiplied by (1 divided by T2 minus 1 divided by T1) multiplied by Delta Q.  

(5755 multiplied by 349.49 multiplied by 0.95849 minus 5755 multiplied by 1.3009) equals 1287.18 kilojoules per kelvin.  

Table A-2:  
s2 equals sf at 70 degrees Celsius equals 0.95849.  
s1 equals sf at 100 degrees Celsius equals 1.3009.
