A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'P [Pa]' and the x-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The graph includes two intersecting lines:  
- A purple straight line sloping downward.  
- A blue curve representing a phase region labeled 'Nassdampfgebiet' (wet steam region).

The page contains two diagrams related to thermodynamics.  

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The graph is labeled with axes: pressure (P [Pa]) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [K]) on the horizontal axis.  
   - A curve is drawn representing the phase regions.  
   - The triple point is marked on the curve, labeled as "Triplex".  
   - Two intersecting lines are drawn, one sloping upward and the other downward.  

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - The graph is labeled with axes: pressure (P [Pa]) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [K]) on the horizontal axis.  
   - A cycle is depicted with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the cycle.  
   - The process between points 4 and 1 is labeled "isobar" in pink.  
   - The process between points 1 and 2 is labeled "isobar" in pink.  

Both diagrams are drawn on a grid background.
