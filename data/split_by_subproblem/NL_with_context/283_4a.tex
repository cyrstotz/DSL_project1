A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis labeled in bar and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis labeled in degrees Kelvin [Â°K]. The graph shows a curve resembling a phase diagram, with a peak at the top. There is a shaded region above the peak, and the curve slopes down on both sides.
