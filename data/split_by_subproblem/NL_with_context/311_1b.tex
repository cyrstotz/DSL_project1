T KF equals integral from s a to s e of T dS divided by s a minus s e.  
Delta e equals p a minus p KF equals 0 (isobaric).  
Q equals m dot KF times (s KF in minus s KF out) plus Q dot out divided by T.  
s KF in minus s KF out equals T.  
T equals T out minus T in divided by the natural logarithm of (T out divided by T in).  
T equals 357.844.
