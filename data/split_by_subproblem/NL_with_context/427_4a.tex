A diagram is drawn with pressure (p) in bar on the vertical axis and temperature (T) in Kelvin on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes four labeled states connected by arrows:  
- State 1 is at the lowest pressure and temperature.  
- State 2 is at a higher pressure and temperature.  
- State 3 is at the highest pressure.  
- State 4 returns to the lower pressure but remains at the same temperature as State 3.  

The following annotations are written:  
- State 1  
- State 2  
- State 3: p3 equals 8 bar  
- State 4: p4 equals 8 bar  

Additional notes:  
- T equals 6 Kelvin  
- x equals 1 at State 2  
- x equals 0 at State 4
