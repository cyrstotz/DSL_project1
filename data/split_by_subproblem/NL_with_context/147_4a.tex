A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p [bar]" and the x-axis labeled as "T [K]".  

The graph represents a phase diagram with four distinct points labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- Point 1 is at the lower left, connected to point 4 by a curve.  
- Point 4 is connected to point 3 by a steep upward curve.  
- Point 3 is connected to point 2 by a downward curve.  
- Point 2 is connected back to point 1 by a horizontal line.  

Arrows indicate the direction of the process flow:  
- From point 1 to point 4, then to point 3, then to point 2, and finally back to point 1.  

The graph includes a shaded region near point 3, suggesting a specific phase or process occurring in that area.
