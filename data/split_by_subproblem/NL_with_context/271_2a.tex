A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled points 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- The diagram includes three isobars labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), and \( p_2 \).  
- Point 0 is at the lowest temperature and entropy.  
- Point 2 is higher on the \( p_0 \) isobar.  
- Point 3 is on the \( p_2 \) isobar at a higher temperature and entropy.  
- Point 4 is on the \( p_1 \) isobar, slightly lower in entropy than point 3.  
- Point 5 is on the \( p_1 \) isobar, lower in temperature and entropy than point 4.  
- Point 6 is at the lowest entropy, near point 0.  
- Arrows indicate transitions between the points.
