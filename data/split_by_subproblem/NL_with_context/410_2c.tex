wc equals 510 joules divided by T6 equals 341 Kelvin.  

O equals m dot multiplied by (h6 minus hout minus T0 multiplied by (S6in minus S6out)) plus w5 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2 plus Q dot in minus Ex ideal.  

Delta ex str equals wc minus w0 minus T0 multiplied by (S0 minus S6) plus w5 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

Delta ex str equals Cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0 minus T0 multiplied by ln(T6 divided by T0)) plus w5 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

h6 minus h0 equals Cp multiplied by (T6 minus T0).  
S6 minus S0 equals Cp multiplied by ln(T6 divided by T0).
