R equals R divided by M equals 166.28 joules per mole Kelvin.  
A equals D squared times pi divided by 4 equals 0.00785 square meters.  
p_EW equals p_amb plus m_K times g divided by A equals 1.3937 bar.  
p_g equals p_EW plus m_EW times g divided by A approximately equals 1.4009 bar.  

PV equals m times RT implies m equals 3.42 grams.
