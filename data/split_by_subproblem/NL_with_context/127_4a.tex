A diagram is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and another variable (possibly temperature or entropy) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- The path from state 1 to state 2 is labeled "isobar."  
- The path from state 3 to state 4 is labeled "isobar."  
- The path between states 2 and 3 is curved and labeled "ND."
