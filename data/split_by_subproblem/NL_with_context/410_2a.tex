A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S [kJ]". The graph represents a thermodynamic process with points labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  
- Between points 1 and 2, the curve is labeled "isentrop".  
- Between points 2 and 3, the curve is labeled "isentrop".  
- Between points 3 and 4, the curve rises steeply and is labeled "isobar p3/p4".  
- Between points 4 and 5, the curve descends steeply and is labeled "isentrop".
