0 equals m dot times the quantity h zero minus h a plus w six squared minus w a squared divided by two, plus Q dot minus W dot.  

Isentropic state change  

Therefore, u equals H equals 1.9.  

T two divided by T n equals the quantity u two divided by u n raised to the power of n minus one divided by n.  

Here:  
T six divided by T five equals the quantity u six divided by u five raised to the power of k minus one divided by k.  

T six equals T five times the quantity u six divided by u five raised to the power of k minus one divided by k equals 328.07 Kelvin.
