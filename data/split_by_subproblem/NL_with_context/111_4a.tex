A graph is drawn with labeled axes. The vertical axis is labeled "p" (pressure), and the horizontal axis is labeled "T" (temperature). Three phase regions are marked: "Fest" (solid), "Fl√ºssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). Two steps are indicated:  
- Step i: A line is drawn from the liquid region to the gas region.  
- Step ii: A line is drawn from the solid region to the gas region.  

Points 1, 2, and 3 are marked along the lines, corresponding to different states in the process.
