The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is calculated using the equation:  
\[ \dot{m} = \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h_2 - h_3} \]  
Where:  
- \( \dot{Q}_K \) is the heat flow rate.  
- \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) are enthalpy values at states 2 and 3, respectively.  
- Additional terms \( \Sigma Q_{in} \) and \( \Sigma W_{in} \) are crossed out.  
- \( \dot{m} \) is simplified to \( \frac{\dot{Q}_K}{h_2 - h_3} \).
