A graph is drawn with labeled axes. The vertical axis is labeled 'T' (temperature), and the horizontal axis is labeled 's' (entropy). The graph includes several curves representing isobars, labeled \( p_{2/3} \), \( p_5 \), and \( p_0 \). Points are marked and connected with arrows, labeled sequentially from 0 to 6. The transitions between points are labeled as 'isentrop' (isentropic) or 'isobar' (isobaric).
