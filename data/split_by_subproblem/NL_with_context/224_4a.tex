A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as pressure (p) and temperature (T). The diagram includes phase regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous). The triple point is marked, and a line labeled "5 mbar" is drawn below the triple point. The states 1, 2, 3, and 4 are labeled on the diagram, with arrows indicating transitions between these states.
