Fn equals mk times g plus mEW times g plus p0.  
- 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared plus 0.1 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared.  
- Equals 314.8 kilograms meters per second squared plus 1 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals.  

pg times A equals Fn.  
pg equals Fn divided by A.  
pg equals 314.8 plus 1 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals divided by A.  
pg equals 1.4 bar.  

A equals r squared times pi.  
A equals 0.05 meters squared times pi equals 0.007854 square meters.  

mg equals p times V divided by R times T.  
pg equals 1.5 bar.  
T equals 773 kelvin.  
V equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.  

R equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole equals 166.28 joules per kilogram kelvin.  

mg equals 1.5 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 166.28 times 773 kelvin.  
mg equals 3.666 kilograms.
