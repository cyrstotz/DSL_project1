The task involves a T-s diagram labeled as "Process."  

The diagram is a temperature (T) versus entropy (s) graph with the following details:  
- The y-axis is labeled as "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The x-axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" (entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  

Key points and annotations:  
1. Point 1 is marked at the bottom left near \( P_0 \) (ambient pressure).  
2. Point 2 is connected to Point 1 with a line labeled "s = const" (entropy is constant).  
3. Point 3 is above Point 2, connected by a line labeled "p = const" (pressure is constant).  
4. Point 4 is connected to Point 3 with a line labeled "s = const."  
5. Point 5 is connected to Point 4 with a line labeled "q2 = const" (heat addition is constant).  
6. There is a wavy line extending from Point 5, labeled "s = const."  

Temperature values:  
- At Point 1: \(-30^\circ \, \text{C}\) or \(243.15 \, \text{K}\).  
- At Point 3: \(1289 \, \text{K}\).  
- At Point 5: \(431.9 \, \text{K}\).  

Additional notes:  
- "Luft ideales Gas" (air as an ideal gas).  
- "keine 'Slacks'" (no "slacks").
