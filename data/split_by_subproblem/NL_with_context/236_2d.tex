Exergy loss:  

Exergy balance:  
Delta ex over delta t, zero stationary equals the sum over i of ex stream i plus the sum over j of ex Q j minus the sum over n of W dot n of t minus p zero times dV of t over dt minus ex loss.  

Ex loss equals ex stream minus W dot, after turbine no work.  

Ex loss over m gas equals ex stream over m gas. Therefore, ex loss equals ex stream equals 100 kilojoules per kilogram.
