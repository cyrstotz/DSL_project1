A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as 's [kJ/kgK]' and the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]'. The graph includes several curves and lines:  
- A curved line labeled 'isobar'.  
- Another curved line labeled 'isotherm'.  
- A point marked with an asterisk (*) on the graph.  
- A general shape resembling a thermodynamic process diagram.

A graph is drawn with the label "T-s" at the top left. The graph includes several curves and lines:  
- A vertical line labeled "Isobar."  
- A curved line labeled "Isotherm."  
- Points labeled "1," "2," "3," and "4" connected by arrows.  
- The process between points "1" and "2" is marked as "adiabatic reversible."  
- The process between points "2" and "3" is labeled "isobar."  
- The process between points "3" and "4" is labeled "isotherm."  
- The process between points "4" and "1" is labeled "adiabatic reversible."  

Below the graph, text reads:  
- "0 vergleichen sind adiabatisch reversibel."  
- "Wenn nicht reversibel, dann handelt es sich um eine isentrope Diffusion oder Verdichtung."
