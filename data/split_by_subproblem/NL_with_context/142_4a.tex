A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "T [°C]" and the y-axis labeled as "p [bar]".  

The graph shows a curve starting at approximately 0.07 bar and increasing steadily. The curve is divided into regions labeled "flüssig" (liquid) and "gas".  

Specific points are marked on the graph:  
- A point labeled "p3 = 8 bar" near the top of the curve.  
- Another point labeled "2" slightly below "p3".  
- A third point labeled "1" at the lower end of the curve.  

The graph also includes annotations:  
- "10" written near the top left corner.  
- "Aufgabe 4: a)" written above the graph.  

Additional text:  
- "X2" written below the graph.  
- "p3 = 8 bar" written near the bottom of the graph.
