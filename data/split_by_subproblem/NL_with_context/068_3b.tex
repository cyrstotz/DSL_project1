Gas: Ideal gas state equation!  

=> p_g1 times V_g1 divided by R_g times T_g1  
=> V_g1 = R_g times T_g1 divided by p_g1  
=> V_g1 divided by m_g = R_g times T_g1 divided by p_g1  

=> m_g = V_g1 times p_g1 divided by R_g times T_g1  
= V_g1 times p_g1 divided by R times T_g1  
= (3.14 times 10 to the power of -3 m cubed times 1.5 times 10 to the power of 5 N divided by m squared) divided by (8.314 J divided by mol times K divided by (500 plus 273.15) K)  

=> m_g = 3.664 g
