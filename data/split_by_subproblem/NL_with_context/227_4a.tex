A graph is drawn with temperature (T in Kelvin) on the x-axis and pressure (p) on the y-axis. The graph shows three distinct regions labeled as "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gasförmig" (gaseous).  
- The solid region is marked with an isotherm line.  
- The liquid region is marked with an isobar line.  
- The gaseous region is enclosed below the curve.  
Points labeled "1", "2", and "3" are marked on the graph, indicating transitions between the phases.
