A diagram is drawn with labeled points representing the jet engine process. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as "T in K" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as "s in kJ/kgÂ·K" (entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  

The diagram includes the following points and connections:  
- Point 0 is connected to point 1, labeled with \( p_0 \).  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2, labeled with \( p_2 \).  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3, labeled with \( p_3 \).  
- Point 3 is connected to point 4, labeled with \( p_4 \).  
- Point 4 is connected to point 5, labeled with \( p_5 \).  
- Point 5 is connected to point 6, labeled with \( p_6 \).
