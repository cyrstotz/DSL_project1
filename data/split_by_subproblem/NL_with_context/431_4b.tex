The equation is written as:  
0 equals m-dot times (h2 minus h3) plus Q-dot minus W-dot.  

Below the equation, calculations are shown:  
h2 equals hfg plus hf at 27.7.15 K equals 295.55 kJ/kg.  
s2 equals s3 equals sg at 7°C equals 0.9163 kJ/kg·K.  

Ti equals 10°C equals 283.15 K.  

Pressure conditions are noted:  
pTriple equals 6 mbar.  
p1 equals 1 mbar equals p2.  

T2 equals 283.15 K minus 6 K equals 277.15 K.  

Further calculations are partially crossed out and unclear, but include references to "Tab A-10" and "hfg."
