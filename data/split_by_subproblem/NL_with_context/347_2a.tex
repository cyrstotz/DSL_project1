A graph is drawn with labeled axes. The vertical axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin), and the horizontal axis is labeled "s [kJ/kg·K]" (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  

The graph includes several curves and points:  
- Point "0" is marked at the bottom left.  
- A curve labeled "η < 1" starts from point "0" and rises upward.  
- Points "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", and "6" are marked along different curves.  
- Dashed lines connect some points and curves.  
- The label "p_0 = p_amb" appears near point "0".  
- Additional labels include "p_1", "p_4", and "p_5".
