R equals R divided by M sub g equals 166.28 joules per kilogram kelvin.  

p sub g equals m sub EW times g divided by (d divided by 2) squared plus m sub K times g divided by (d divided by 2) squared plus p sub amb equals 2.259 bar.  

d equals 0.1 meters.  

p V equals m R T.  
T sub g equals 773.15 kelvin.  
V sub g equals 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters.  

m sub g equals p sub g times V sub g divided by R times T sub g equals 9.52 grams.
