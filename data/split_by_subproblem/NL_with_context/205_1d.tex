d) Energy balance for cooling the reactor:  
\( Q_{R,12} = Q_{out,12} = \Delta m_{12} \cdot (h_{out,12} - h_{in,12}) \)  

Given:  
\( Q_{R,12} = 35 \, \text{MJ} \)  
\( h_{out,12} = h_f(70^\circ \text{C}) \)  
\( h_{in,12} = h_f(20^\circ \text{C}) \)  

\( \Delta m_{12} = Q_{R,12} / (h_{out,12} - h_{in,12}) \)
