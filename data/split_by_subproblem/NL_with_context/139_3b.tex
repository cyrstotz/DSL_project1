The membrane is heat-conducting, so the EW and the gas have the same temperature.  
The same applies to the pressure; the membrane is frictionless.  

p sub 2 equals F sub K divided by A equals 32 kg times 9.806 divided by (pi times 0.05 squared) equals 3955.9847 N divided by m squared equals approximately 3956 N divided by m squared.
