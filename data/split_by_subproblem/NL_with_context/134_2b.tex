The question asks for "w6, T6?"  
- "isentrop: u = h = 1.4 → Tc = (pc / ps)^(1 - 1/k) → Tc = (5 / 0.5)^(1 - 1/1.4)"  
- The calculation results in Tc = 328.675 K.  

Energy balance:  
"ṁ (h1 - h2) + w5² - w6² / 2 (adiabat) + Q (w) = 0"  

Further derivation:  
"ṁ cp ln(T5 / Tc) + w5² - w6² / 2 + R(T2 - Tn) / 1 - k = 0"  

Constants:  
"R = cp - cv"  
"cp / cv = 1.4 → cv = cp / 1.4 = 0.718 kJ/kg·K"  
"R = 0.287 kJ/kg·K"
