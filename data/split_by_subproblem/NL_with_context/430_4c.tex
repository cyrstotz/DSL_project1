A diagram is drawn showing a pipe with a valve labeled "1" and "2". The following equations and values are written:  
- \( p_{1} = 8 \, \text{bar} \)  
- \( x_{1} = 0 \)  
- \( Q_q = h_f \cdot l_f = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  
- \( l_f = 93.42 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)  

An equation for vapor quality is written:  
\( x_{1} = \frac{l_1 - l_f}{l_g - l_f} \).
