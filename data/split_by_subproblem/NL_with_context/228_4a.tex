A graph is drawn with pressure (P in bar) on the y-axis and temperature (T in Kelvin) on the x-axis. The graph includes a curve labeled "Triplepunkt" (triple point). Two phases are marked:  
1. A region labeled "ii" on the left side of the curve.  
2. A region labeled "i" on the right side of the curve.
