Tg | Vg | Pg  
1 | 500Â°C | 3.14 L | 1.4008 bar  
2 | - | - | 1.4008 bar  

Pg equals Rg times Tg divided by mg times Vg.  
Rg equals R divided by Mg equals 0.166285944.  

Pg equals (Fk divided by A) plus (FEW divided by A).  

Fk equals 324.9 N.  
FEW equals mEW times g equals 0.981 N.  

A equals pi times r squared equals pi times d squared divided by 4 equals 0.00785 square meters.  

Pg equals 140080.8163 Pa equals 1.4008 bar.  

mg equals Pg times Vg divided by Rg times Tg equals 3.42 g.
