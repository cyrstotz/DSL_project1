Energy balance for the entire process:  
Q = h_e - h_a + w_e squared minus w_a squared divided by 2 plus q_B  

Transition from state 5 to 6 is adiabatic and reversible:  
(T6 / T5) = (p6 / p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n  
n = k = 1.4  

T6 = T5 multiplied by (p6 / p5) raised to the power of (n minus 1) divided by n = 328.1 K  

h_e minus h_a = c_p multiplied by (T2 minus T_a)  

w_a = 2 multiplied by (h_e minus h_a plus q_B) plus w_e squared =  
c multiplied by (T_e minus T_a) divided by (T_0 minus T_6)
