A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 'S [kJ/kgÂ·K]'. The graph represents a T-s diagram with several labeled points and processes:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 connected to point 2 via an isobaric line labeled 'p = 0.191 bar'.  
- Point 2 connected to point 3 via an adiabatic line labeled 'p2'.  
- Point 3 connected to point 5 via an isobaric line labeled 'p = 0.5 bar'.  
- Point 5 connected to point 6 via an adiabatic line labeled 'p = 0.191 bar'.  
- The processes are labeled as 'isobar' and 'adiabat' along the respective lines.
