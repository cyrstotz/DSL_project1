A graph is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "s [kJ/kg·K]" (specific entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin).  

The graph depicts a T-s diagram with several points labeled:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 slightly above and to the right of Point 0, connected by an "isobar" line.  
- Point 2 above Point 1, connected by an "isotherm" line.  
- Point 3 further to the right and above Point 2, connected by another "isobar" line.  
- Point 4 below Point 3, connected by an "isotherm" line.  

The diagram includes curved lines labeled "isotherm" and "isobar" to indicate the thermodynamic processes.  

To the right of the graph, a box contains the interpolation formula:  
Y = Y1 + (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1) × (X - X1)
