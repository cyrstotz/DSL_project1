A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and process points. The diagram includes the following details:  
- Points labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  
- \( p_2 = p_3 \), \( s_4 = s_2 \), \( p_4 = p_5 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( p_1 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \), \( s_5 = s_6 \).  
- A note labeled "mein Punkt" (my point).  
- Axes are labeled as \( T \, (\text{K}) \) and \( s \, (\text{kJ/kg·K}) \).  

Another T-s diagram is drawn below, showing similar labeled points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). The axes are labeled as \( T \, (\text{K}) \) and \( s \, (\text{kJ/kg·K}) \). A note is included: "nicht nullpunkt" (not zero point).
