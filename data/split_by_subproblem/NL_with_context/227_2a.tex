A graph is drawn representing a T-s diagram. The graph includes labeled points and curves:  
- Point 0 is marked at the origin.  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 by a steep curve labeled "isotherm."  
- Point 2 connects to point 3 by a downward curve.  
- Point 3 connects to point 4 along a straight line labeled "isobar."  
- Point 4 connects to point 5 by a curved line.  
- Point 5 connects to point 6 by another curved line.  
The axes are labeled:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T(K)."  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "S."  
A box is drawn near the horizontal axis labeled "wd kg/k."
