A graph is drawn with the title "T-s Diagram." The x-axis is labeled as entropy (s) in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kg·K), and the y-axis is labeled as temperature (T) in Kelvin (K). Several curves are shown, representing isobars. Points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves, with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  
- The process from 1 to 2 is labeled as "adiabatic → isentropic."  
- The process from 2 to 3 is labeled as "isobar."  
Additional annotations include:  
- "p2 = p3"  
- "p4 = p5"  
- "p6 = p0 = p6"
