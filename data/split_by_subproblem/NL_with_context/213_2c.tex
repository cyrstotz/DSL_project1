Delta exergy stream equals h_a minus h_e minus T_0 multiplied by (s_a minus s_e) plus Delta kinetic energy.  

h_a minus h_e equals c_p multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) equals 85.432 kilojoules per kilogram.  

T_0 multiplied by (s_a minus s_e) equals T_0 multiplied by c_p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_6 divided by T_0) equals 73.2758 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta kinetic energy equals one-half multiplied by (w_6 squared minus w_0 squared) equals 108.688 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy stream equals 267.358 kilojoules per kilogram.
