A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [°C]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]". The graph shows a thermodynamic process with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Point 3 is marked with "P2 = P5".  
- Point 4 is marked with "P4 = P5".  
- Point 0 is marked with "P0 = P6".  
The curve includes arrows indicating the direction of the process between the points.
