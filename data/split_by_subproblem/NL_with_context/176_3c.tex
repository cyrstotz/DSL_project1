Delta E equals E_2 minus E_1 equals m_g multiplied by u_2 minus m_g multiplied by u_1 equals Q minus W_v.  

T_g2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.  
T_g1 equals 500 degrees Celsius.  

u_2 minus u_1 equals c_v multiplied by (T_2 minus T_1) equals 316.5 joules per kilogram.  

W_v divided by m equals R multiplied by (T_2 minus T_1) divided by 1 minus n.  
n equals R plus c_v divided by c_v equals 1.263.  

W_v divided by m equals 0.16628 multiplied by (500) divided by 1 minus 1.263 equals -316.5 joules per kilogram.  

Reibungsfrei â†’ isochor.  
n equals R plus c_v divided by c_v equals 1.263.
