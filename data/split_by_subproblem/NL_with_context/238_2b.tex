The energy balance equation is written as:  
dE/dt = Σm_i [h_i + ke_i + pe_i] + ΣQ_j - ΣW_n  

Notes are added:  
- "o, da adiabatisch" (since adiabatic)  
- "Eine Schaufelreihe verrichtet keine Arbeit" (a blade row performs no work)  

The following calculations are shown:  
T_6 / T_5 = (p_c / p_5)^(n-1)/n  
=> T_6 = (p_c / p_5)^(n-1)/n  
T_s = 0.7586 × 431.9 K  
=> T_6 = 328.07 K  

O = m_gas [h_s - h_c + w_s squared / 2 - w_c squared / 2]  
- O = 0  

h_s - h_c = c_p (T_5 - T_6)  
= 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin × (431.9 K - 328.07 K)  
= 104.44825 kilojoules per kilogram  

w_s squared / 2 = h_s - h_c + w_c squared / 2  
=> w_c squared = 2(h_s - h_c + w_s squared / 2)  
=> w_c = square root of [2(h_s - h_c + w_s squared / 2)]  
= square root of [2 × 104.44825]  
= 220.47 meters per second  

The final result is boxed:  
w_c = 220.47 meters per second
