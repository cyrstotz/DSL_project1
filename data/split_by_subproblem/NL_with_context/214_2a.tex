A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T in K" and the x-axis labeled as "s in kJ/kgÂ·K". The graph represents a T-s diagram with several points labeled as "1", "3", "5", and "6". These points are connected by lines forming a cycle. The region is marked with dashed lines and labeled "Isobaren" (Isobars).
