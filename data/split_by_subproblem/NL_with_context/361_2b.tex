The heading "st. Flie√üprozess" (steady flow process) is written.  

An equation is provided:  
\( 0 = \dot{m} (h_e - h_a + \frac{w_e^2 - w_a^2}{2}) + Q - W \)  

It is simplified to:  
\( h_e - h_a = c_p (T_e - T_a) + \frac{w_e^2}{2} \)  

Another equation is written:  
\( h_e - h_a = \int c_p dT = c_p (T_e - T_a) \)  

Adiabatic process is noted:  
\( T_6 = T_5 (\frac{p_6}{p_5})^{\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa}} \)  
\( T_6 = 431.9 (\frac{0.191}{0.5})^{\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}} = 323.075 \, \text{K} \)  

Velocity calculation:  
\( w_6^2 = 2 [c_p (T_2 - T_1) + \frac{w_e^2}{2}] = 257.28 \, \text{m/s} \)  
\( w_6 = 507.24 \, \text{m/s} \)
