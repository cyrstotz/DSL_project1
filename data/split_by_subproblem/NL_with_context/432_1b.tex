T mean equals integral from s a to s e of T d s divided by integral from s a to s e of d s.  

Ideal fluid assumption implies d s equals c p divided by T times d T.  

Therefore, T d s equals c p times d T. Integral of T d s equals c p times (T out minus T in).  

s a minus s e equals c p times ln of (T out divided by T in).  

T mean equals (T out minus T in) divided by ln of (T out divided by T in).  

T mean equals (298.15 minus 288.15) Kelvin divided by ln of (298.15 divided by 288.15).  

T mean approximately equals 9.66 Kelvin.
