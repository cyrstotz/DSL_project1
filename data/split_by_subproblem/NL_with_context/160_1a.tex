Steady-state flow process:  

0 equals m dot multiplied by (s_e minus s_a) plus Q dot divided by T plus S dot_erz.  

0 equals m dot multiplied by (h_e minus h_a) plus Q dot_out minus m dot multiplied by v_2 multiplied by 0, as kinetic energy is negligible.  

Q dot_out equals m dot multiplied by (h_a minus h_e).  

h_a minus h_e equals c_if multiplied by (T_a minus T_e) plus v_1 multiplied by (p_2 minus p_1).  

p_2 equals p_a.  

Diagram: A rectangular box labeled T_KF,e and T_KF,a with an arrow labeled Q dot_out pointing outwards.  

Q dot_out equals m dot multiplied by c_if multiplied by (T_KF,a minus T_KF,e).
