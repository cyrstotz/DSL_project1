A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph shows a thermodynamic process with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  
- The process from 1 to 2 is marked as "isentrop".  
- The process from 2 to 3 is marked as "isobar".  
- The process from 3 to 4 is marked as "isobar".  
- The process from 4 to 5 is marked as "isentrop".  
The isobars are labeled as "p2 = p3" and "p4 = p5".
