A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]" and the y-axis labeled as "T [K]". The graph represents a T-s diagram with six points labeled sequentially from 1 to 6.  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 via an "isentropic" curve.  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 via an "isobaric" curve.  
- Point 3 is connected to point 4 via an "isentropic" curve.  
- Point 4 is connected to point 5 via an "isobaric" curve.  
- Point 5 is connected to point 6 via an "isentropic" curve.  
- Point 6 is connected back to point 1 via an "isentropic" curve.  
The label "p_5 = p_0 → isobaric" is written near point 5.
