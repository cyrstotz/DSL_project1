A diagram is drawn with the axes labeled as 'T' (temperature) on the vertical axis and 's' (entropy) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows a process with six labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 connected to Point 2 by a vertical line.  
- Point 2 connected to Point 3 by a curved line.  
- Point 3 connected to Point 4 by a horizontal line.  
- Point 4 connected to Point 5 by a curved line.  
- Point 5 connected to Point 6 by a horizontal line.  
Two isobars are labeled as \( p_2 \) and \( p_0 \).
