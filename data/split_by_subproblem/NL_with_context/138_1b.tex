Thermodynamic mean temperature of the system: open, stationary, assuming ideal liquid properties.  
T KF in equals 288.15 Kelvin.  
T KF out equals 298.15 Kelvin.  
p 1 equals p 2.  

T KF equals integral from T KF in to T KF out of T dS divided by integral from T KF in to T KF out of dS.  
S equals integral of c times ln(T) with c as constant, so:  
T KF equals T KF out minus T KF in divided by ln(T KF out divided by T KF in).  

T KF equals (298.15 minus 288.15) divided by ln(298.15 divided by 288.15), approximately equals 293.12 Kelvin.
