The page contains three diagrams labeled with pressure (P) and volume (V) axes.  

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The graph shows a curve starting in the liquid phase, transitioning through the wet steam (Nassdampf) region, and ending in the steam (Dampf) phase.  
   - Points labeled as "4" and "1" are marked within the wet steam region.  
   - The curve is annotated with arrows indicating the direction of the process.  

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - Similar to the first diagram, the graph transitions from the liquid phase to the wet steam region and then to the steam phase.  
   - Points "4" and "1" are marked within the wet steam region.  
   - An additional annotation indicates "isobare" (isobaric process) near the steam phase.  

3. **Third Diagram**:  
   - The graph starts in the liquid phase, moves through the wet steam region, and ends in the steam phase.  
   - Points "4", "1", "2", and "3" are marked along the curve.  
   - The wet steam region is labeled "Nass Dampf".  
   - The steam phase is labeled "Dampf".  
   - Annotations include "isobare" near the steam phase and "P3" and "PA" indicating pressures.
