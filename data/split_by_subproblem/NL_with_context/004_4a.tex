A graph is drawn with the vertical axis labeled as "p (bar)" and the horizontal axis labeled as "T [K]". The graph includes two curves labeled "i" and "ii".  

- Curve "i" starts at point 1 and moves downward sharply, indicating a decrease in temperature (\( \Delta T < 0 \)).  
- Curve "ii" starts at point 1 and moves downward more gradually, labeled as "isotherm".  

The graph includes points labeled "1", "6", and "2".  

Below the graph, the following text is written:  
- "i ist, schar \( \Delta T < 0 \)"  
- "ii ist isotherm"
