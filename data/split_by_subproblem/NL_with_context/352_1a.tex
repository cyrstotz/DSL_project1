dE/dt = Σṁh + ΣQ̇ - ΣẆ  

O = ṁ(h_in - h_out) + Q̇_R - Q̇_out  

Q̇_out = Q̇_R - ṁ(h_in - h_out)  

h_in = h(70°C, saturated liquid) = h(70°C, 0.31482 bar) = 232.88 kJ/kg  

h_out = h(100°C, saturated liquid) = h(100°C, 1.014 bar) = 419.04 kJ/kg  

⇒ Q̇_out = 100 - 0.3(232.88 - 419.04)  

= 62.2 kW

Entropy balance around the reactor:  
dS/dt equals the sum of inlet entropy flow rates minus the sum of outlet entropy flow rates plus entropy production rate.  

dS/dt equals zero minus mass flow rate in times (entropy out minus entropy in) plus heat flow rate out divided by thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant plus entropy production rate.  

Entropy production rate equals heat flow rate out divided by thermodynamic mean temperature of the coolant plus mass flow rate in times (entropy out minus entropy in).  

S_out equals entropy at 100 degrees Celsius, saturated liquid, pressure 0.014 bar, equals 1.3062 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (from Table A-2).  

S_in equals entropy at 30 degrees Celsius, saturated liquid, pressure 0.031 bar, equals 0.2549 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (from Table A-2).  

Entropy production rate equals 22.4 kilojoules per Kelvin.

An equation is written:  
"ΔE = ΣΔh + ΣQ - ΣW"  
The term 'std' is crossed out, and 'adiabatic' is written above it.  

Another equation follows:  
"0 = ṁ (h_ein - h_aus)"
