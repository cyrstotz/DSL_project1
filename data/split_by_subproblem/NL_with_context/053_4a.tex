A graph is drawn with axes labeled as pressure (p [bar]) on the vertical axis and temperature (T [K]) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts a cycle with four points labeled as 1i, 2i, 3i, and 4i. The cycle starts at 1i, moves to 2i, then to 3i, and finally to 4i, forming a closed loop. The pressure at point 1i is marked as 5 bar.
