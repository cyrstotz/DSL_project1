A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'p [bar]' and the x-axis labeled as 'T [°C]'. The graph includes the following features:  
- A curve labeled 'Flüssig' (liquid) and 'Fest' (solid) in the lower region.  
- A line labeled 'gas' in the upper region.  
- A point labeled 'Tripel' (triple point) where the lines intersect.  
- A vertical dashed line at a point labeled 'Ti const' (constant Ti).  

Below the graph, the following text is written:  
Ti = solid 4.5K  
x = 0 liquid = vapor  
x = 1 p/E solid?
