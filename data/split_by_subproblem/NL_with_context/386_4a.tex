A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows three regions labeled "Fest" (solid), "Flüssig" (liquid), and "Gas" (gas). A triple point is marked as "Tripel," and two states are labeled as "1" and "2." The region between "Flüssig" and "Gas" is shaded.
