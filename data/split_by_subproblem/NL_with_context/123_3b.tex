Yes: Tg2 plus pg2  

The process is adiabatic; therefore, the polytropic relationship \( pV^n = \text{constant} \) applies.  

From the ideal gas equation \( pV = mRT \), it follows that if \( pV^n \) is constant, the process must also be isothermal!  

Thus, \( Tg2 = Tg1 = 500^\circ \text{C} \).  

\( pV^n = mRT \)  
\( p2 = \frac{mRT}{V^n} = \frac{3.1422 \times 10^{-3} \times 166.28}{3 \times 10^{-3}} \)
