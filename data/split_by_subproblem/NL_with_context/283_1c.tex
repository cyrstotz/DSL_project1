Entropy balance around the cooling jacket:  
\( 0 = \frac{\dot{Q}_{out}}{T_{Reactor}} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{out}}{T_{KF}} + \dot{S}_{erz} \)  

Diagram: A rectangular representation of the cooling jacket with arrows labeled \( \dot{Q}_{out} \) entering and exiting.

S erz equals Q aus divided by T KF minus Q aus divided by T Reactor equals sixty-two point three kilojoules per second multiplied by the quantity one divided by two hundred ninety-five kelvin minus one divided by three hundred seventy-three point fifteen kelvin.  
Equals forty-four point three joules per kelvin equals S erz (boxed).
