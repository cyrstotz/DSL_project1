\( T_{g,2} / p_{g,2} \)  

(It stabilizes, meaning \( x_2 < x_1 \) before.)  
The temperature of the gas will decrease due to heat transfer \( Q_{12} \).  

The pressure remains \( p_1 \), as the external conditions do not change.  
The temperature will reach approximately \( 0^\circ \, \text{C} \), as the water has a high heat capacity.  

Since the ice at \( 0^\circ \, \text{C} \) first undergoes a phase transition, energy is consumed!  
Solid to liquid requires energy from the air, which changes at the temperature boundary.  

\( T_{g} \to 0^\circ \)  
\( p_{g,2} = p_1 \)
