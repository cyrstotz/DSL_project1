Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is labeled "p-T" and shows a curve with multiple regions. The regions are labeled as follows:  
   - "Flüssig" (liquid)  
   - "Nassdampf" (wet steam)  
   - "Gas"  

   Points are marked as "21", "23", and "5->5".  

2. The second diagram is also labeled "p-T" and shows a curve with regions labeled:  
   - "Flüssig" (liquid)  
   - "Nassdampf" (wet steam)  

   Points are marked as "21", "22", "3", and "4".
