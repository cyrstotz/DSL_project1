Delta S equals m total multiplied by s at 100 degrees Celsius minus m total multiplied by s at 70 degrees Celsius plus the summation of m i multiplied by q i divided by T j from state 1 to state 2.  

Delta S equals (m total minus Delta m 12) multiplied by s f at 70 degrees Celsius minus Delta m 12 multiplied by s g at 100 degrees Celsius minus m total multiplied by s f at 100 degrees Celsius.  

Delta m 12 equals 263.07 kilograms.  

Delta S equals negative 600.6647 multiplied by s f 12.
