E_C equals Q dot zu divided by W dot t equals Q dot zu divided by Q dot zu minus Q dot ab equals Q dot zu divided by Q dot ab.  

E_C equals Q dot k divided by W dot k equals m dot R134a multiplied by [h_2 minus h_1] divided by 28 W.  

Energy balance evaporator:  
0 equals m dot multiplied by [h_1 minus h_2] plus Q dot c.  
Q dot c equals m dot multiplied by [h_2 minus h_1].
