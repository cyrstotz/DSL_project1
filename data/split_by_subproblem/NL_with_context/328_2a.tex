The page contains three diagrams:  

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The graph is labeled with "2" at the top left.  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature), and the x-axis is labeled as "s" (entropy).  
   - The curve starts at a low entropy value, rises to a peak, and then decreases.  
   - The x-axis has units "kJ/kg".  

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature), and the x-axis is unlabeled.  
   - The graph consists of four points connected by lines:  
     - Point 1 to Point 2 is a vertical line.  
     - Point 2 to Point 3 is a horizontal line.  
     - Point 3 to Point 4 is a downward-sloping line.  

3. **Third Diagram**:  
   - The y-axis is labeled as "T" (temperature), and the x-axis is labeled as "s" (entropy).  
   - The graph starts at Point 1, rises vertically to Point 2, then moves horizontally to Point 3, labeled "isobar".  
   - From Point 3, the curve slopes downward to Point 4, then continues to Point 5 and Point 6.  
   - The x-axis has units "kJ/kg".  
   - A note is written: "T5 = 431.94".
