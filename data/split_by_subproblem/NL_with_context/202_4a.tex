A graph is drawn with axes labeled as `p` (pressure) on the vertical axis and `T` (temperature) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a cycle with four states labeled `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`. The process between states `1` and `2` is marked as `(ii)`, and the process between states `4` and `1` is labeled as "isobare Verdampfung" (isobaric evaporation). The process between states `2` and `3` is labeled "Komprimiert" (compressed).
