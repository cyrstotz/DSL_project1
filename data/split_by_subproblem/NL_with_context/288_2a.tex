A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as T [K] and the x-axis labeled as S [kJ/kgÂ·K]. The graph shows several curves labeled with pressure values:  
- P2 = P3  
- P1 = PS = P4  
- P0  

Points are marked on the graph as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.5, and 6, with arrows indicating transitions between these points.
