A graph is drawn with the label "Aufgabe 2" at the top. The graph is a T-s diagram (temperature-entropy diagram).  

- The y-axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The x-axis is labeled "S [kJ/kg]" (entropy in kilojoules per kilogram).  
- The graph shows a curve with multiple points marked.  
- There is a labeled section "Isoline" near the upper part of the curve.
