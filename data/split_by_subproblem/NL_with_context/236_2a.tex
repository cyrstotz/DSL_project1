A temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram is drawn with labeled points representing the jet engine process. The diagram includes:  
- Point 0 at the origin.  
- Point 1 labeled as "isentrop."  
- Point 2 labeled as "isobar p2 = p3."  
- Point 3 connected to point 4 with an upward curve.  
- Point 4 connected to point 5 with a downward curve labeled "isobar p0 = p5."  
- Point 5 connected back to point 0.  

A smaller schematic diagram is drawn in the top right corner, showing the same process qualitatively with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
