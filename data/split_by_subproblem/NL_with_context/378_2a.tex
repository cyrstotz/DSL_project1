A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph represents a T-s diagram with several curves and points labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 2 is higher on the same curve as point 1.  
- Point 3 is on a different curve above point 2, labeled with "p = p3".  
- Point 4 is on a curve labeled "p = p4".  
- Point 5 is lower than point 4, labeled "p = 0.5 bar".  
- Point 6 is at the bottom right, labeled "p = p0".  
Arrows indicate the direction of processes between the points.
