Entropy balance  

A diagram is drawn showing two boxes connected by an arrow labeled \( \dot{Q}_{ab}(G) \). The first box is labeled "100" and the second box is labeled "70". Above the arrow, the text "m12 * h12" is written.  

The equation for entropy change is written as:  
ΔS = (m_total + m12) * s2 (at T = 70°C) - m_total * s1 (at T = 100°C) + \( \dot{Q}_{ab} \) / T01
