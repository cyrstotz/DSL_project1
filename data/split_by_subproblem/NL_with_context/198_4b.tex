Energy balance for the compressor:  
0 equals mass flow rate of refrigerant times (h2 minus h3) plus heat flow rate minus work rate.  

Equation:  
0 = mass flow rate of refrigerant Ã— (h2 - h3) + heat flow rate - work rate.  

Work rate divided by (h2 - h3) equals mass flow rate of refrigerant.  

h2 equals h2,g (T2).  

T2 equals Ti minus 6 Kelvin.  
With conditions from ii), Ti can be determined using the p-T diagram:  
Ti equals 10 degrees Celsius equals 283.15 Kelvin.
