Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is labeled with axes \( p \) (mbar) on the vertical axis and \( T \) (K) on the horizontal axis. It shows a rectangular cycle with four states labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The transitions between states are marked as "isobar" and "adiabat."  
2. The second diagram is also labeled with axes \( p \) (mbar) on the vertical axis and \( T \) (K) on the horizontal axis. It shows a similar cycle with states 1, 2, 3, and 4, but the transitions are marked as "isobar" and "isochor."
