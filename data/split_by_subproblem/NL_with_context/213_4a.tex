A diagram is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes labeled regions:  
- "Fest" (solid) at the top left.  
- "Fl√ºssig" (liquid) at the top right.  
- "Sublim I" (sublimation) at the bottom left.  
- "Gas" (gas) at the bottom right.  

A curve separates the solid and liquid regions, labeled as "isobar." Three points are marked:  
- Point 1 is in the liquid region.  
- Point 2 is in the gas region.  
- Point 3 is on the curve between the solid and liquid regions.  

A horizontal line labeled "10K" is drawn below the curve.
