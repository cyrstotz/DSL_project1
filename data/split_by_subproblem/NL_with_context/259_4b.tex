A table is provided with columns labeled "T", "P", and "x". The entries are as follows:  
- Row 1: T = -100°C, P = p2 = p1.  
- Row 2: T = -40°C, P = p2 = p1.  
- Row 3: T = -40°C, P = 8 bar.  
- Row 4: T = -40°C, P = 5 bar, x = 0.  

Additional notes:  
- Ti = -100°C → T2 = T2 = -40°C.  
- "23 process" is written.  

An equation is written:  
Q equals m dot times (he minus ha) plus Q23 minus W dot K.  

Another equation is written:  
m dot equals W dot K divided by (he minus ha).  

Further details:  
he equals hg (-40°C) equals 244.9 kilojoules per kilogram.  
ha = (no value provided).
