A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph represents a T-s diagram with several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Point "0" at the bottom left with pressure \( p = p_0 \).  
- Point "1" slightly above "0" with pressure \( p = p_1 \).  
- Point "2" higher up with pressure \( p = p_2 \).  
- Point "3" at the top with pressure \( p = p_2 \).  
- Point "4" descending from "3" with pressure \( p' = p_4 \).  
- Point "5" further down with pressure \( p' = p_4 \).  
- Point "6" at the bottom right with pressure \( p = p_0 \).  

Dashed lines connect the points, indicating isobars for the respective pressures.
