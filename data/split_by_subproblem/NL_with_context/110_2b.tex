The following equations and calculations are written:  

1. "w6 = ?" and "T6 = ?"  

2. The equation:  
"0 = Î£ mges [h5 - h6 + w5 squared divided by 2 - w6 squared divided by 2]"  

3. Expanded equation:  
"0 = h5 - h6 + w5 squared divided by 2 - w6 squared divided by 2"  

4. Rearranged equation:  
"2 (h6 - h5) - w5 squared = -w6 squared"  

5. Further expanded:  
"2 cp (T6 - T5) - w5 squared = -w6 squared"  

6. The formula for T6:  
"T6 divided by T5 = (p0 divided by p5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n"  
"n = 1.4"  

7. Substituting values:  
"T6 = T5 (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4"  
"T6 = 431.9 Kelvin multiplied by (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4"  
"T6 = 328.0747 Kelvin"  

8. Highlighted result:  
"T6 = 328.0747 Kelvin"  

9. Calculation for w6:  
"w6 squared = 2 multiplied by 1.006 multiplied by 1000 multiplied by (328.0747 Kelvin minus 431.9 Kelvin) minus (220 meters per second squared)"  
"w6 squared = -257278 meters squared per second squared"  

10. Final result:  
"w6 = 507.244 meters per second"  

Highlighted result:  
"w6 = 507.244 meters per second"
