A graph is drawn with axes labeled as pressure (p) and temperature (T) in Kelvin (Â°K). The graph depicts a cycle with four points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
- The segment from point 1 to point 2 is labeled "isobar."  
- The segment from point 3 to point 4 is labeled "isobar."  
A smaller, unlabeled sketch is drawn to the right of the main graph.
