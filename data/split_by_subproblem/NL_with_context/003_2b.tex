An equation is written:  
dE/dt = summation of m_i(t) multiplied by h_i(t) plus l_e_i(t) plus q_e_i(t), plus summation of q_i(t), minus summation of w_in(t).  

Another equation follows:  
0 = m_gas multiplied by (h_s minus h_6) plus (w_5 squared divided by 2 minus w_6 squared divided by 2), minus integral from 1 to n of rho multiplied by dV.  

A further equation is written:  
h_s minus h_6 = integral from T_6 to T_s of c_p(T) dT = c_p multiplied by (T_s minus T_6).  

Below this, "m_gas" is written.
