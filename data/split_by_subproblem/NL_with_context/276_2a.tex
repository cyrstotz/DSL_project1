A T-s diagram is drawn with the temperature (T) on the vertical axis labeled in Kelvin [K] and entropy (s) on the horizontal axis labeled in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin [kJ/kgÂ·K].  
The diagram includes the following labeled points and processes:  
- Point P0 at the bottom left.  
- An isentropic line from P0 to P2.  
- An isobaric line from P2 to P3.  
- An isentropic line from P3 to P4.  
- An isobaric line from P4 to P5, with pressure labeled as "p = 0.5 bar."  
- An isentropic and reversible line from P5 to P6.
