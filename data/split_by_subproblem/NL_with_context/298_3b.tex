\( T_{g,2} \), \( p_{g,2} \)?  

\( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \), it is present at equilibrium.  

The temperature \( T_{g,2} \) is exactly the equilibrium temperature of the EW, i.e., \( T_{EW,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \). The thermal equilibrium is achieved (no heat flow anymore). \( p_{g,2} \) remains constant because the outlet area of the cylinder is fixed, and the weight of the water-ice mixture and piston also remains constant.
