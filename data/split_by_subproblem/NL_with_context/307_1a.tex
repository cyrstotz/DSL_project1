Energy balance:  
Zero equals m dot times (h in minus h out) plus Q dot out plus W dot equals zero.  

Q dot out equals m dot times (h out minus h in) equals m dot times the integral from T in to T out of c f times dT plus v f times (p out minus p in), which is crossed out.  

Equals m dot times c f times (T out minus T in).
