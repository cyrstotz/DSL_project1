p g1 equals p amb plus p weight  
p g amb equals F divided by pi times (D squared divided by 4) equals 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by pi times (0.1 meters squared divided by 4) equals 333691.53 pascals approximately equals 0.4 bar  

p g1 equals 1.4 bar  

p g1 times V g1 equals m g times R g times T g1  
m g equals p g1 times V g1 divided by R g times T g1 equals 1.4 times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 0.162 kilojoules per kilogram kelvin divided by 223.15 kelvin equals 3.3 times 10 to the power of negative 2 kilograms
