The task involves calculating \( w_6 \) and \( T_6 \):  
- From 5 to 6: "rev adiabat isentrop n = k = 1.5"  
- The equation \( T_6 / T_5 = (P_6 / P_5)^{(k-1)/k} \) is written.  
- \( T_6 = T_5 (P_6 / P_5)^{(k-1)/k} \) is calculated as \( T_6 = 328.07 \, K \).  

For \( w_6 \):  
- The equation \( w_6^2 = 2 \, mges \, (h_5 - h_6) = 2 \, mges \, c_v (T_5 - T_6) \) is written.  
- \( w_6 = \sqrt{2 \, mges \, c_p \, k (T_5 - T_6)} \).  
- \( w_6 = 540.8 \, m/s \).  

Additional notes:  
- \( k = c_p / c_v \), and \( c_v = c_p / k \).
