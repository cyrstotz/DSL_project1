A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 's [J/kgÂ·K]'. The graph represents a T-s diagram with several labeled points and curves:  
- Point '1' is marked with 'isentrop'.  
- Point '2' is connected to '1' and labeled as 'adiabat'.  
- Point '3' is connected to '2' and labeled as 'isobar'.  
- Point '4' is connected to '3' and labeled as 'adiabat, irreversible'.  
- Point '5' is connected to '4' and labeled as 'isobar'.  
- Point '6' is connected to '5' and labeled as 'turbine'.
