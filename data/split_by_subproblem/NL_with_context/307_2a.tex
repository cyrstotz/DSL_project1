Two diagrams are drawn:

1. **First Diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled. The horizontal axis is marked as `[kJ/kg·K]`, and the vertical axis is not explicitly labeled.  
   - The diagram shows a process labeled with points `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the process between the points.  
   - The process between `0` and `1` is labeled as "isentrope."  
   - The process between `1` and `2` is labeled as "isotherm."  
   - The process between `2` and `3` is labeled as "isobar."  
   - The process between `3` and `4` is labeled as "isentrope."  
   - The process between `4` and `5` is labeled as "isobar."  

2. **Second Diagram**:  
   - The axes are labeled. The horizontal axis is marked as `[kJ/kg·K]`, and the vertical axis is labeled as `T [K]`.  
   - The diagram shows a process labeled with points `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`.  
   - Arrows indicate the direction of the process between the points.  
   - The process between `0` and `1` is labeled as "isentrope."  
   - The process between `1` and `2` is labeled as "isobar."  
   - The process between `2` and `3` is labeled as "isobar."  
   - The process between `3` and `4` is labeled as "isentrope."  
   - The process between `4` and `5` is labeled as "isobar."  
   - The process between `5` and `6` is labeled as "isentrope."
