A graph is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as \( s \).  
- The y-axis is labeled as \( T \).  

The graph includes four points labeled \( s_1 \), \( s_2 \), \( s_3 \), and \( s_4 \).  
Three processes are marked:  
1. Adiabatic (reversible) from \( s_1 \) to \( s_2 \), \( T_1 \rightarrow T_2 \).  
2. Isobaric, isothermal from \( s_2 \) to \( s_3 \).  
3. Adiabatic (reversible) from \( s_3 \) to \( s_4 \).
