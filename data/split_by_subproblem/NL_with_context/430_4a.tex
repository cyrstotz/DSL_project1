A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p [bar]" and the x-axis labeled as "T [°C]". The graph depicts a phase diagram with labeled regions: "Flüssig" (liquid), "Nassdampf" (wet steam), and "Trocken" (dry). Points 1, 2, and 3 are marked along the curve, with arrows indicating transitions between the states. The curve is labeled "isotherm".
