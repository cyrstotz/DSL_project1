Steady-state flow process:  
0 equals Delta exergy flow at state 6 plus 1 minus T subscript 0 divided by T multiplied by Q dot minus W dot minus exergy loss.  

Adiabatic turbine: Q dot equals zero.  

W dot equals W dot turbine plus W dot compressor.  

W dot turbine equals h subscript 5 minus h subscript 6 plus (w subscript 5 squared minus w subscript 6 squared divided by 2) plus q subscript B divided by (c subscript p multiplied by (T subscript 5 minus T subscript 0)).
