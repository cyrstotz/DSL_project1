T_g equals 500 degrees Celsius.  
V_g,1 equals 3.14 liters.  
rho_g equals 96 kilograms per cubic meter.  

Force equals 32.9 times 9.81 meters per second squared equals 343.52 newtons.  

A equals pi times r squared. r equals D divided by 2 equals 0.05 meters.  
A equals 7.853 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters.  

Pressure through weight equals 343.52 newtons divided by 7.853 times 10 to the power of negative 3 square meters equals 0.04 bar.  

GSW, in EW chamber, equals 1.4 bar, so mass in gas chamber equals 1.4 bar.  

p_g,1 equals 1.4 bar.  

m_g equals p_g times V_g divided by R_g times T_g.  

m_g equals 1.4 times 10 to the power of 5 pascals times 3.14 times 10 to the power of negative 3 cubic meters divided by 8.314 joules per mole per kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole times 773.15 kelvin.  

m_g equals 3.445 times 10 to the power of negative 3 kilograms equals 3.445 grams.
