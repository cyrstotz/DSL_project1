Delta exergy stream equals exergy stream six minus exergy stream zero equals h six minus h zero minus T zero multiplied by (s six minus s zero) plus w six squared divided by two minus w zero squared divided by two.  

h six minus h zero equals c p multiplied by (T six minus T zero) equals 719.608 kilojoules per kilogram.  

s six minus s zero equals c p multiplied by ln (T six divided by T zero) minus R multiplied by ln (p six divided by p zero) equals 0.927905 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

w zero squared divided by two equals 20 kilojoules per kilogram.  

w six squared divided by two equals 1487.8 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Delta exergy stream equals 1489.21 kilojoules per kilogram.
