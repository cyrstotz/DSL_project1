The page contains two diagrams.  

The first diagram is a T-s diagram (temperature versus entropy) with labeled isobars. The axes are labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T (K)" for temperature in Kelvin.  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "S (kJ/kg·K)" for entropy in kilojoules per kilogram per Kelvin.  

The diagram shows five points labeled:  
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5.  
Arrows indicate the direction of the process.  

The second diagram is another T-s diagram with labeled points. The axes are the same as the first diagram:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T (K)."  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "S (kJ/kg·K)."  

The points are labeled:  
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5.  
Arrows indicate the direction of the process. The labels "ṁ_K" and "ṁ_M" are written near the diagram.
