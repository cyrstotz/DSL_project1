A p-T diagram is drawn with labeled axes: pressure (p in mBAR) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in degrees Celsius) on the horizontal axis.  
The diagram includes three regions:  
- "Fest" (solid)  
- "Fl√ºssig" (liquid)  
- "Gas" (gas)  

The sublimation point is marked, and the triple point is labeled at 5 mBAR.  
Two steps are shown:  
- Step I: A vertical line labeled "10K" above the sublimation point.  
- Step II: A horizontal line extending from the triple point into the gas region.
