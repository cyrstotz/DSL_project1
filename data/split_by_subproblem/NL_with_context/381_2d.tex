O equals W divided by m.  

O equals delta exergy plus (1 minus Tc divided by Tj) multiplied by Qj minus W turbine minus exergy loss.  

Exergy loss equals delta exergy minus W turbine divided by m.  

Equals 100 megajoules per kilogram.  

Logarithmic average turbine and velocity.  

Energy bilanz:  

W turbine divided by m equals (h3 minus h4) divided by cv multiplied by (T3 minus T4) plus velocity squared divided by 2.

Delta ex str equals ex str 6 minus ex str 0.

Equals (crossed-out section) (n6 minus e0) minus T0 times (s6 minus s0) plus p0 times (V6 minus V0).

Equals cp times (T6 minus T0) minus T0 times (cp times (T6 divided by T1) minus R times ln (p6 divided by p0)) plus p0 times (V6 minus V0).

V0 equals R times T divided by p0.  
V6 equals R times T divided by p0.  

R equals cp times (1 minus 1 divided by k).  
Cv equals cp divided by k.
