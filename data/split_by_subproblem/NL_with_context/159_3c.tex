Delta E equals m multiplied by delta U equals m multiplied by U gas minus U gas 2 equals Q equals Q.  

m multiplied by (U gas minus U gas 2) equals cV multiplied by (T2 minus T1) multiplied by m equals 7.1394 kilojoules equals Q.  

cV equals 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
m equals 3.6 grams.  
T gas equals 0.0030 liters.
