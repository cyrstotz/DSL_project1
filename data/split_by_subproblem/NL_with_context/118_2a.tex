Entropy production equals negative mass flow rate times the difference between specific entropy at the exit and specific entropy at the inlet, plus the sum of heat flow divided by temperature.  
Mass flow rate equals 0.3 kilograms per second, specific entropy at the exit equals 0.1545 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, specific entropy at the inlet equals 1.377, heat flow equals reaction heat flow minus heat flow removed.

A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the vertical axis and entropy (s) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled curves:  
- An "isobar" connecting points 2 and 3.  
- An "isentrope" connecting points 1 and 2, and another connecting points 5 and 6.  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves.  

Below the graph, the following is written:  
\( p_0 = 0.191 \), \( T_0 = -30^\circ \), \( s_0 = \)  

An arrow is drawn pointing from \( s_0 \) to \( s_0 \), with the notation \( s_1 \neq s_0 \).
