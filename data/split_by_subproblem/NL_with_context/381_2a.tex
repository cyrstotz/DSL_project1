A table is drawn with columns labeled "T", "P", and "[h]".  

- Row 1:  
  T = -30  
  P2 = P4  

- Row 2:  
  P3 = P4  

- Row 3:  
  P4 = P5  

- Row 4:  
  T = 431.9 K  
  P = 0.5 bar  

- Row 5:  
  P = 0.151 bar  

Additional notes:  
- \( \eta_{V,s} < 1 \)  
- "isentropic"  

Below the table:  
- \( w_{Luft} = 200 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- \( w_5 = 220 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- \( p_0 = (0.191 \, \text{bar}) \)  
- \( \dot{m}_M = 5.292 \, \dot{m}_K \)  
- \( c_p = 1.006 \)

A graph is drawn with entropy (S) on the x-axis labeled in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin (kJ/kgÂ·K) and temperature (T) on the y-axis labeled in Kelvin (K). The graph shows a qualitative T-S diagram with labeled isobars and processes:  
- Point 1 is at the bottom left, labeled as 'isentrop'.  
- Point 2 is higher on the curve, labeled 'isentrop (reversible)'.  
- Point 3 is further up, labeled 'isentrop reversible w'.  
- Point 4 is on a downward curve, labeled 'isobar (0.5 bar)'.  
- Another isobar is labeled '1.5 bar'.
