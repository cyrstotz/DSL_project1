Exergy loss equals T0 times entropy production.  

Entropy production equals entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 5, which equals entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0.  

Entropy at state 6 minus entropy at state 0 equals q divided by m times T minus (sa minus se), which equals s6 minus s0 equals cp times ln(T6 divided by T0) minus R times ln(p6 divided by p0) minus qB divided by TB.  

Entropy production equals cp times ln(T6 divided by T0) minus R times ln(p6 divided by p0) minus qB divided by TB.  

Entropy production equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times ln(340 Kelvin divided by 243.15 Kelvin) minus 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin divided by 1.4 times ln(0.5 bar divided by 0.191 bar) minus 1195 kilojoules per kilogram divided by 1289 Kelvin.  

Entropy production equals negative 0.5898 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

"I assume a sign error."  

Exergy loss equals T0 times entropy production equals 243.15 Kelvin times negative 0.5898 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin equals negative 143.47 kilojoules per kilogram.
