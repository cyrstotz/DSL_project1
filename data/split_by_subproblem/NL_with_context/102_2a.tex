A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph includes several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Point "1" is at the bottom of the first curve.  
- Point "2" is higher up on the same curve.  
- Point "3" is on a separate curve above point "2".  
- Point "4" is on a curve below point "3".  
The curves are labeled as "isobaric" and "adiabatic".
