A graph is drawn with pressure labeled as "p [bar]" on the vertical axis and temperature labeled as "T [K]" on the horizontal axis. The graph includes three points labeled as 1, 2, and 3.  
- Point 1 is connected to Point 2 with the label "isobares tiefk√ºhlen" (isobaric cooling).  
- Point 2 is connected to Point 3 with the label "isothermes Drucksenken" (isothermal pressure reduction).
