T KF: Entropy balance around KF:  

P KF = P KF ein equals isobar equals reversible  
L p Serz equals 0  

O = m dot KF times (s e minus s a) plus Q aus divided by T KF  
= m dot KF times c KF times ln (T e divided by T a) minus Q aus divided by T KF

L dot m KF: Energy balance around KF:  

O = m dot KF times (h e minus h in) minus Q aus  

Delta m KF = Q aus divided by h e minus h a  
= Q aus divided by c KF times (T e minus T a)  

O = Q aus divided by c KF times ln (T e divided by T a) minus Q aus divided by T KF  

Q R divided by T e minus T a times ln (T e divided by T a)  

Q aus divided by T e minus T a times ln (T e divided by T a)  

Q aus divided by T KF = 243.12 Kelvin
