Energy balance:  
(m one plus delta m one) u two minus m one u one equals delta m one two times c p (T two minus T one) plus Q  

m one (u two minus u one) plus Q equals delta m one two times [c p (T two minus T one) plus u two]  

m one c v (T two minus T one) plus Q divided by c p (T two minus T one) plus u two equals delta m one two
