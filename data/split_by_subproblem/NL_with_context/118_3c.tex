Delta E equals the sum of Q12 minus the sum of Wv,12.  

W equals the integral from 1 to 2 of p dV, which equals p_gas times (U2 minus U1).  

U2 equals mRT2 divided by p, which equals (3.42 times 10 to the power of -3) times R times 273.153 divided by (1.4 times 10 to the power of 5), which equals 0.01110 cubic meters or approximately 1.11 liters.  

Therefore, W equals (1.1 times 10 to the power of 5) times (1.11 times 10 to the power of -3 plus 3.41 times 10 to the power of -3), which equals 594.943.  

Delta E equals Cv times (T2 minus T1), which equals 0.633 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin times (273.153 minus 773.15), which equals -3.96 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Therefore, Delta E times m equals:  

Q12 equals Delta E plus W.
