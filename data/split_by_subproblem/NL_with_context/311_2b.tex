Schubdüse adiabatisch, reversibel  
=> s5 = s6 (isentropic)  

T6 divided by T5 equals (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of k minus 1 divided by k.  

T6 equals T5 multiplied by (P6 divided by P5) raised to the power of k minus 1 divided by k.  

T6 equals 328.075 Kelvin (underlined).  

=> LHS von an der Schubdüse  
Q equals m-dot multiplied by (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2).  

w6 squared divided by 2 equals h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared divided by 2.  

h5 minus h6 equals cp multiplied by (T5 minus T6) equals 103.888 kilojoules per kilogram (underlined).  

w6 equals the square root of 2 multiplied by (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared divided by 2).  

w6 equals 506.14 meters per second (underlined).
