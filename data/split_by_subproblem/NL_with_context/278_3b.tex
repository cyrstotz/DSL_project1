\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \)  

The system must remain in equilibrium with the surroundings â€” pressure and gravitational force!  

\( \Rightarrow p_{g,2} = 1.40 \, \text{bar} \)  

\( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \)  

The gas is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the ice-water mixture, where \( x_{Ice,2} > 0 \). It must remain in equilibrium at \( T_{g,2} = 0^\circ \text{C} \), and therefore the gas temperature is also at \( 0^\circ \text{C}! \)
