A second graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis labeled in bar and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis labeled in Kelvin [K]. The graph shows a similar phase diagram curve with annotations:  
- "isobare Abk√ºhlung" (crossed out) and "isotherm Druckminderung" written near the curve.  
- Three points labeled 1, 2, and 3 are marked on the graph.  
- Two horizontal dashed lines are drawn, labeled "10 mbar" and "5 mbar."  
- The curve peaks at the top and slopes down on both sides.

Energy balance around the compressor:  

W dot h equals m dot times (h2 minus h3)
