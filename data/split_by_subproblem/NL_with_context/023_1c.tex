\( \dot{S}_{erz} = ? \)  

A diagram is drawn showing a rectangular box labeled \( T_{KF,in} \) on the left and \( T_{KF,out} \) on the right. Inside the box, there is an arrow labeled \( \dot{Q} \) pointing from left to right. Below the box, \( T_{wall} = 343.15 \, \text{K} \) is written.  

An equation is written:  
\( \dot{S}_{erz} = \dot{m} \cdot (s_{out} - s_{in}) + \frac{\dot{Q}}{T_{wall}} \)  

Another equation is written:  
\( \frac{\dot{Q}_{in}}{T_{KF,in}} - \frac{\dot{Q}_{out}}{T_{wall}} = \dot{S}_{erz} \)  

\( T_{wall} = 100^\circ \text{C} \)  

The result is written:  
\( = 0.496 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kgÂ·K}} \)
