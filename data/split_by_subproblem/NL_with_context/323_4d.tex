COP equals the absolute value of Q dot K divided by the absolute value of W dot K, which equals the absolute value of Q dot K divided by the absolute value of W dot K, and equals 28.

Q dot zu: First law of thermodynamics, heat transfer equation.  
Zero equals m dot times (h2 minus h1) plus Q dot zu.  
Q dot zu equals m dot divided by h2 minus h1.
