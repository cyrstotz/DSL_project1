Thermodynamic mean temperature T KF:  
T KF equals integral of T d s divided by s a minus s e  

=> d H equals T d s plus V d p (since V d p equals 0)  
=> integral of T d H divided by s a minus s e equals h a minus h e divided by s a minus s e  

=> c p times (T a minus T e) divided by c p times ln (T a divided by T e) minus R times ln (p a divided by p e) (R term equals 0)  

=> T KF equals T a minus T e divided by ln (T a divided by T e)  
T KF equals 288.15 minus 298.15 divided by ln (288.15 divided by 298.15) equals 283.124 Kelvin
