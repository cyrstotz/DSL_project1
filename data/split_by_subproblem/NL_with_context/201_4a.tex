A graph is drawn with pressure (p in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in Kelvin) on the horizontal axis. The graph depicts a cycle with four labeled points: 1, 2, 3, and 4. The cycle includes the following processes:  
1 → 2: Isobaric  
2 → 3: Adiabatic and reversible (isentropic)  
3 → 4: Isobaric  
4 → 1: Isentropic
