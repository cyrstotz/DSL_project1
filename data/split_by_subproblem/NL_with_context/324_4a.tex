h f (31.33) = 94.49 + x (34.39 - 94.49)  
h f = 94.4235  
g (31.33) = Gleich = 2.675  

[Diagram]  
A graph is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "p".  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "T".

A table is drawn with the following columns:  
- `zust` (state)  
- `P` (pressure)  
- `V` (volume)  
- `T` (temperature)  
- `X` (vapor quality)  

The rows are labeled as follows:  
1. \( T = T_i \)  
2. \( 6 \, \text{K} \)  
3. \( 6 \, \text{K} \)  
4. \( 8 \, \text{bar} \)  
5. \( T = T_h \), \( x = 0 \)  

Next to the table, the following annotations are written:  
- "isobaric evaporation, 6K"  
- "adiabatic throttle"  
- "isobaric"  

A curve is drawn next to the table, labeled "adiabatic throttle."
