A diagram is drawn with axes labeled "T" (temperature) on the vertical axis and "s" (entropy) on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes curves and labeled points:  
- Point 1 is connected to Point 2, labeled as "reversible adiabatic."  
- Point 2 connects to Point 3, labeled "isobar."  
- Point 3 connects to Point 4.  
- Point 4 connects to Point 5.  
- Point 5 connects to Point 6, labeled "p6 = p0 isobar."  
The curve includes a region labeled "NS."
