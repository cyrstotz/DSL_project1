p_gas = T_g2 and p_g2  

p_g2 = p_1 = m_K times g divided by A = m_EW times g divided by A  

= 1.4 bar, as the mass of the piston and the ice-water mixture remains constant (density difference negligible), the pressure also remains constant.  

T_g2 = T_EW = 0 degrees Celsius = 273.15 Kelvin, as the system is still in equilibrium. The water does not heat further since the ice is not completely melted.
