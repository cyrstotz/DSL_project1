The page contains two diagrams:  

1. **Diagram 1 (Top)**:  
   - The graph is labeled with "Eis" (Ice) and "Wasser" (Water).  
   - There is a curve transitioning from "Eis" to "Wasser."  
   - A horizontal line is marked "T triple" (Triple Point).  
   - The x-axis is labeled "T" (Temperature).  
   - The y-axis is labeled "p" (Pressure).  
   - A vertical arrow points upward, indicating a transition.  

2. **Diagram 2 (Bottom)**:  
   - The graph shows a curve with labeled points.  
   - The x-axis is labeled "T" (Temperature).  
   - The y-axis is labeled "p" (Pressure).  
   - A horizontal line is marked "1000, i" and "2000, i."  
   - Arrows indicate transitions between states.
