Delta exergy stream equals h six minus h zero minus T zero multiplied by [s six minus s zero] plus (w six squared minus w zero squared) divided by 2.  

For ideal gas:  
Delta exergy stream equals c p multiplied by (T six minus T zero) minus T zero multiplied by c p multiplied by ln(T six divided by T zero) minus R multiplied by ln(p six divided by p zero) plus (w six squared minus w zero squared) divided by 2.  

Delta exergy stream equals 1.006 multiplied by [340 minus 243.15] minus 243.15 multiplied by 1.006 multiplied by ln(340 divided by 243.15) minus 0.287 multiplied by ln(0.5 divided by 0.191) plus [(510 squared minus 200 squared) divided by 2 multiplied by 10 raised to the power of -3].  

Delta exergy stream equals 125.1472 kilojoules per kilogram.
