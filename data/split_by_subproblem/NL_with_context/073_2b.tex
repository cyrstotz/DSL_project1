The process from 5 to 6 is described as isentropic:  
T6 divided by T5 equals (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (k minus 1) divided by k.  
This leads to:  
T6 equals T5 multiplied by (p6 divided by p5) raised to the power of (k minus 1) divided by k.  
Substituting values:  
T6 equals 431.9 K multiplied by (0.191 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4.  
Result: T6 equals 328.07 K.  

An energy balance equation is written:  
0 equals m-dot multiplied by (h5 minus h6 minus T0 multiplied by (s5 minus s6) plus alpha kinetic energy) plus the summation of (1 minus T0 divided by Tj) multiplied by Qj-dot minus Wj-dot minus Exergy loss-dot.
