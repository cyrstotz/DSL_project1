Given: m dot R134a  

Energy balance from state 0 → 3:  
Delta e squared = sum of m dot (h plus w squared divided by 2) minus sum of m dot (h plus w squared divided by 2) minus sum of W dot  
Wk = 0, externally supplied  

m dot = Wk divided by h2 minus h3  

From Table A-11:  
h2 (8 bar, D) = 93.48  
hg (8 bar, D) = 264.15  
sf (8 bar, D) = 0.3459  
sg (8 bar, D) = 0.9006  

From Table A-10:  
h1 = hf (8 bar, D) = 93.48  

Ti = Ti - QK = 273.15K  

From Table A-10, directly interpolated:  
hf (4°C) = 247.53  
sf (4°C) = 0.910  

x3 = sf minus sf divided by sg minus sf = greater than 1 → identified state
