paus rein equals reversible, S dot erz equals 0.  
Q equals m dot times (s1 minus s2) plus Qaus divided by T bar.  
T bar equals m dot times (s2 minus s1) plus Qaus.  

Q equals m dot times (hKF1 minus hKF2) plus Qaus.  
Negative Qaus divided by (hKF1 minus hKF2) equals negative m dot KF divided by e to the power of (T1 minus T2 divided by T1).  

T bar equals 1 divided by Qaus times e to the power of (T1 minus T2 divided by T1).  
T bar equals Qaus divided by e to the power of (T1 minus T2 divided by T1).  
T bar equals 293.12 Kelvin.
