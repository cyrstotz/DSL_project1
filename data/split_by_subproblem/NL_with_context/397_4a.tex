Freeze-drying with an R134a cooling cycle.  

A diagram is drawn with a pressure-temperature (p-T) curve.  
- The curve includes labeled regions:  
  - "Flüssig" (Liquid)  
  - "Dampf-Flüssig zweiphasiges Gebiet" (Vapor-liquid two-phase region)  
  - "Gas" (Gas)  
- Four points are marked on the curve:  
  - Point 1 is in the two-phase region.  
  - Point 2 is at the boundary between the two-phase region and the gas region.  
  - Point 3 is in the gas region, labeled with "Isobar p3 > 8 bar".  
  - Point 4 is in the liquid region.  
- Arrows indicate transitions between the points, forming a cycle.
