Transferred heat quantity:  

Energy balance: Closed system  
Delta E equals Q twelve minus W reversible twelve  

W reversible twelve equals integral from V one to V two of p ausen dV equals p ausen multiplied by (V two minus V one)  

V two equals (assuming T two equals zero degrees Celsius)  
pV equals mRT  
equals m g R g T two divided by p ausen  

equals 1.11 liters equals 0.00111 cubic meters  

equals negative 223.41 joules  

Delta E equals m multiplied by (u two minus u one) equals m multiplied by (c V multiplied by (T two minus T one))  

equals 0.00269 multiplied by (6.833 multiplied by (273.153 minus 773.15))  

equals negative 851.38 joules  

Q twelve equals negative 1074.79 joules
