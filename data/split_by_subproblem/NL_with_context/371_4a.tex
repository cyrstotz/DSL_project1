A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "p [bar]" and the x-axis labeled as "T [K]". The graph depicts a dome-shaped curve representing phase regions.  
- The left side of the curve is labeled "gesättigte Flüssigkeit" (saturated liquid).  
- The right side of the curve is labeled "gesättigter Dampf" (saturated vapor).  
- The bottom region under the curve is labeled "Nassdampf" (wet steam).  
- A horizontal line is drawn across the curve, labeled "isobar".  
- The left segment of the horizontal line is labeled "adiabat".  
- The right segment of the horizontal line is labeled "adiabat-reversibel".  
- A point on the right side of the curve is labeled "3".  
- A point on the left side of the curve is labeled "1".  
- A point in the middle of the curve is labeled "2".
