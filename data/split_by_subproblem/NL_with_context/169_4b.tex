The equation is written:  
0 equals m dot R134a multiplied by (h2 minus h3) minus W dot K.  

Rearranged:  
m dot R134a equals W dot K divided by (h2 minus h3).  

Further calculations:  
h2 equals hf plus x multiplied by (hg minus hf).  
h3 equals hf plus hfg.  

Reference to Table A-12:  
h3 at p3 equals 8 bar.  

T3 is unknown.  

Equation:  
h2 at T equals negative 22 degrees Celsius divided by m dot.  

Reference to Table A-10:  
h2 at T2 equals negative 22 degrees Celsius equals 21.77 plus 212.32 equals 234.09 kilojoules per kilogram.
