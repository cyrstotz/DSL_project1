Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph. It includes labeled regions:  
   - A curve labeled "(i)" with an arrow pointing upwards.  
   - A horizontal dashed line labeled "5 mbar" near the bottom of the graph.  
   - Another horizontal dashed line labeled "0.9 mbar" higher up in the graph.  
   - The x-axis is labeled "T" (temperature), and the y-axis is labeled "p" (pressure).  

2. The second diagram is a pressure-volume (p-V) graph. It includes:  
   - A straight line labeled "(i)" sloping upwards.  
   - A horizontal dashed line labeled "5 mbar" near the bottom of the graph.  
   - The x-axis is labeled "V" (volume), and the y-axis is labeled "p" (pressure).
