\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \), because the piston exerts the same additional force, and thus the force equilibrium does not change.  

\( T_{g,2} = T_{EW,1} \), because the gas > 0 must still be in equilibrium with ice in EW, and thus the temperature cannot rise. Since the gas and EW are in thermodynamic equilibrium, the temperatures must be the same.
