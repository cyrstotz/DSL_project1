A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled with values "1" and "10". The horizontal axis is labeled with values "-10", "0", and "10". A curve is plotted, starting from the lower left and increasing upwards to the right. A small vertical line is drawn near the upper part of the curve.
