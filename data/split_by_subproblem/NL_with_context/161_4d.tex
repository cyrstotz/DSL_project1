The equation for the coefficient of performance (COP) is written as:  
COP = Q_K divided by W_K  

The heat transfer equation is written as:  
Q_K = m_R134a multiplied by (h_3 minus h_1)  

Additional notes and equations are provided:  
- "p_1 = p_3"  
- h_2 = h_g (8 bar) = g_2 (from Table A-11)  
- s_2 = s_3  
- s_1 = s_g (T_i minus 6Â°C)  
- x_1 = (s_1 minus s_f (8 bar)) divided by (s_g (8 bar) minus s_f (8 bar))  
- h_3 = h_f (8 bar) plus x multiplied by (h_g (8 bar) minus h_f (8 bar))  

Additional references to "s_f" and "s_g" values from Table A-11 are noted.
