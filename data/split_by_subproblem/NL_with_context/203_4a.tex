A graph is drawn with pressure (p in bar) on the vertical axis and temperature (T in degrees Celsius) on the horizontal axis. Three regions are labeled:  
- "Fest" (solid) at the top left.  
- "Fl√ºssig" (liquid) in the middle.  
- "Gas" (gas) at the bottom right.  

A curve labeled "Tripel" (triple) separates the solid, liquid, and gas regions. Two points are marked:  
- Point "1" in the solid region.  
- Point "2" in the gas region.
