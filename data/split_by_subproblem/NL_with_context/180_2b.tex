Energy balance on the system:  

O equals m multiplied by the quantity h6 minus h0 plus w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2.  

w6 squared minus w0 squared divided by 2 equals 2 multiplied by the quantity h6 minus h0.  

h6 minus h0 equals cp multiplied by the quantity T6 minus T0.  

T6 divided by T5 equals the quantity P6 divided by P5 raised to the power of k minus 1 divided by k.  

T6 equals 328.07 Kelvin.
