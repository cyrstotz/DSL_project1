Delta exergy stream equals (h_e minus h_0 minus T_0 multiplied by (s_e minus s_0)) plus Delta ne.  
This equals c_p multiplied by (T_e minus T_0) minus T_0 multiplied by (c_p multiplied by the natural logarithm of (T_e divided by T_0)) plus (w_e squared minus w_0 squared) divided by 2.  
This equals 110.065 watts per kilogram.
