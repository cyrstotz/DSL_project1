The question asks for the mass flow rate of R134a: "mR134a = ?"  

An equation is written:  
"stat so: dE/dt = -ṁR(h2 - h3) + Q̇ + Ẇk"  

Another equation is written:  
"Ẇk/(h2 - h3) = ṁR134"  

Calculations:  
"h2(8 bar, x2 = 1) = hg(8 bar) TAB A11 = 264.15 kJ/kg"  

"h3(8 bar, S2) => interpolieren @ 8 bar mit S2: h3 = h(Sx) - h(Sr)/(x - Sx)(S2 - Sr) + h(Sr)"  

"S2(8 bar, x = 1) TAB A11 = 0.9066 kJ/kg·K = S3"
