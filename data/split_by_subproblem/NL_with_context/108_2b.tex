w6 = ?  
T6 = ?  

Adiabatic reversible = isentropic  
n = 1.4  

p0 = p6 = 0.19 bar  
p5 = 0.5 bar  
T5 = 431.9 K  

T6 = T5 (p6 / p5) raised to the power of (n - 1) / n  
T6 = 389.07 K  

Energy balance:  
0 = m dot gas (h5 - h6) + m dot gas (w6 squared / 2 - w5 squared / 2)  

h5 - h6 = cp (T5 - T6)  
w6 squared = w5 squared + 2 cp (T5 - T6)  

cp = 1.006 kJ/kgÂ·K  

h5 - h6 = 208.80 J/kg  
w6 squared = 46800 J/kg  

w6 = 507.25 m/s
