A graph is drawn with temperature (T) on the y-axis and entropy (S) on the x-axis. The graph shows a thermodynamic process with labeled points and curves:  
- Point 1 to Point 2: Isobar (constant pressure).  
- Point 2 to Point 3: Isobar.  
- Point 3 to Point 4: Isobar.  
- Point 4 to Point 5: Isobar.  
- Point 5 to Point 6: Isobar.
