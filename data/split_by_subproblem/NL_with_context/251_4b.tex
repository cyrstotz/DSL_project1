A table is presented with columns labeled "1," "2," "3," and "4." Rows are labeled as follows:  
- T [°C]: Values are 31.33 (state 4), 37.1°C (state 3), and 40°C (state 2).  
- p [bar]: Values are 3.3765 (state 1), 3.3755 (state 2), and 8 (state 3 and 4).  
- s [kJ/kg·K]: Values are 0.5165 (state 3).  
- h [kJ/kg]: Some values are crossed out.  

Equations and calculations:  
T_i = T_subl + 10 K = 0°C + 10°C = 10°C  
T_rev = T_i - 6 K = 10°C - 6 K = 4°C  
s_2 = s_g (4°C) = 0.5165 kJ/kg·K (Table A-10)  

T_3 = 8 × 31.33 + 4°C - 31.33 = 37.1°C  
(0.5374 - 0.5165)  

1. HS (2-3):  
0 = ṁ_R134a (h_2 - h_3) - Ẇ_c  
ṁ_R134a = Ẇ_c / (h_2 - h_3)  

h_2 = h_g (40°C) = 249.53 kJ/kg  
h_3 = ...
