A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgK]". The graph shows three isobars labeled \( p_0 \), \( p_1 \), and \( p_2 \). The curve labeled "isentropic process" connects points \( B \) and \( C \). Another curve labeled "irreversible process" connects points \( O \) and \( B \). There is a note stating "Air, ideal gas â†’ no condensation" and "Gas turbine process". An arrow indicates "W is generated".
