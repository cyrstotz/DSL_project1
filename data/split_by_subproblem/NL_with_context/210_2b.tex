Given:  
cp equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, n equals k equals 1.4  

Find: wc and Tc  
pe equals p0 equals 0.191 bar equals 19.1 kilopascals  
ws equals 220 meters per second, ps equals 0.5 bar, Ts equals 431.9 Kelvin  

=> Tc via adiabatic coefficient  
Tc divided by Ts equals (pc divided by ps) raised to the power of (n minus 1 divided by n)  
=> Tc equals Ts multiplied by (pc divided by ps) raised to the power of (0.4 divided by 1.4)  

Tc equals 431.9 Kelvin multiplied by (0.191 bar divided by 0.5 bar) raised to the power of (0.4 divided by 1.4) equals 328.07 Kelvin  

wc:  
Steady flow process in an adiabatic reversible nozzle  

O equals m-dot multiplied by [h5 minus h6 plus (ws squared minus wc squared) divided by 2 plus pe divided by rho]  

O equals h5 minus h6 plus ws squared minus wc squared divided by 2  

h5 minus h6 equals cp multiplied by delta T equals cp multiplied by (Ts minus Tc)  

cp multiplied by (Ts minus Tc) equals (ws squared divided by 2 minus wc squared divided by 2)  

cp multiplied by (Ts minus Tc) plus ws squared divided by 2 equals wc squared divided by 2  

wc squared equals 2 multiplied by cp multiplied by (Ts minus Tc) plus ws squared  

wc equals the square root of [2 multiplied by 1.006 multiplied by (431.9 minus 328.1) plus 220 squared] meters per second  

wc approximately equals 507.2 meters per second
