The pressure of the gas has not changed because no new components have been added that would exert a new pressure.  

p sub 2,g equals p sub 1,g equals 1.4 bar  

If no heat is transferred between the gas and the EW in state 2, there must be no temperature difference between the EW and the gas. This implies that:  

T sub 2,g equals 0 degrees Celsius
