AHS compressor  

O equals m dot times (h two minus h three) equals W dot K  

Diagram: A graph is drawn with labeled points s two equals s three, and m dot is shown flowing through the system.  

m dot equals W dot K divided by (h two minus h three)  

s two equals s three  

p four equals p two  

x four equals zero  

p four equals eight bar  

t four equals thirty-one to thirty-three degrees Celsius  

AHS throttle  

m dot times (h four minus h one) equals zero  

h four equals h one
