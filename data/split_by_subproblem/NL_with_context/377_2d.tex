O equals delta R.  

O equals delta exergy specific minus (1 minus T0 divided by TB) times qB minus wE.  

O equals sum of delta exergy specific plus delta exergy zero equals sum of w minus p times dv divided by dt equals exergy loss divided by mass flow rate.  

O equals delta exergy specific plus (1 minus T0 divided by TB) times qB minus wE equals exergy loss divided by mass flow rate.  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals delta exergy specific plus (1 minus T0 divided by TB) times qB.  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals 37,551 kilojoules per kilogram plus (1 minus T0 divided by TB) times qB.  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals 37,551 kilojoules per kilogram plus (1 minus T0 divided by TB) times qB.  

T0 equals 243.15 Kelvin.  
TB equals 1289 Kelvin.  
qB equals 1195 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Exergy loss divided by mass flow rate equals 1087.17 kilojoules per kilogram.
