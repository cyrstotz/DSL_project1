A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as "p (bar)" on the vertical axis and "T (째C)" on the horizontal axis. The diagram includes three regions labeled "fest" (solid), "fl체ssig" (liquid), and "dampf" (vapor). A curve separates the "dampf" region from the combined "fest" and "fl체ssig" regions. Two processes are marked:  
- Process "i" is shown as a horizontal line within the "fl체ssig" region.  
- Process "ii" is shown as a vertical line starting at the intersection of the curve and the horizontal line, moving downward into the "dampf" region.  
The curve is labeled "Triple Point."
