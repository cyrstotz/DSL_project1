A diagram is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled as 'p' (pressure).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled as 'T' (temperature).  

The diagram includes the following:  
- A curved line representing the phase boundary.  
- Points labeled '1', '2', and '3' connected by arrows.  
- Point '1' is on the phase boundary, and an arrow leads to point '2', which is above the boundary.  
- Point '3' is further along the phase boundary.
