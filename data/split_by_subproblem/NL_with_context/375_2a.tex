A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kgÂ·K]" and the y-axis labeled as "T [K]". The graph shows several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves.  
- Two isobars are labeled as \( p_0 \) and \( p_3 \).  
- Another pair of isobars is labeled as \( p_4 \) and \( p_5 \).  
- The curves are connected with arrows indicating the direction of the process between the points.
