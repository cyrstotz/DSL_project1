p_g1 equals F divided by A.  
n_g1 equals p divided by RT.  

p_g1 equals p_0 plus m_total times g divided by A.  
A equals pi divided by 4 times (D squared), which equals 0.00785398 square meters.  
m_total equals m_K plus m_EW, which equals 32.1 kilograms.  

p_g1 equals 1.80094 bar.  
R equals R divided by M, which equals 166.28 joules per kilogram Kelvin.  
m_g equals p times V divided by RT.  
m_g equals 3.422 grams.
