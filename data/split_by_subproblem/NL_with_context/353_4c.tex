The mass flow rate of R134a is given as:  
ṁ_R134A = 4 kilograms per hour.  
T_2 = -22 degrees Celsius.  

The pressure at state 2 is calculated:  
p_2 = p(-22 degrees Celsius) = 1.2192 BAR.  

The temperature at state 1 equals the temperature at state 2:  
T_1 = T_2.  

The enthalpy at state 4 is determined:  
h_4 = h_f (8 BAR) = 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.  

The vapor quality at state 1 is calculated:  
x_1 = (h_4 - h_f (-22 degrees Celsius)) divided by h_fg (-22 degrees Celsius) ≈ 0.337.
