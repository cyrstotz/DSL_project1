Entropy production:  
\( T_{KF} = 295 \, \text{K} \) is the mean temperature of the coolant.  

Diagram:  
A schematic is drawn showing the reactor and cooling jacket with heat flow \( Q_{aus} \) labeled. A dashed line separates the system boundary.  

Equation:  
\( \dot{S}_{erz} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{aus}}{T_{KF}} = \frac{-62.28 \, \text{kW}}{295 \, \text{K}} = -0.2112 \, \text{kJ/sÂ·K} \).
