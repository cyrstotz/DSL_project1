Increase in exergy:  
Delta ex_str = ex_str,6 minus ex_str,0  

Delta ex_str = h_6 minus h_0 minus T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0) plus kinetic energy term plus potential energy term  

Kinetic energy term:  
w_6 squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2  

Expression for enthalpy difference:  
h_6 minus h_0 = integral from T_0 to T_6 of c_p dt, which simplifies to c_p multiplied by (T_6 minus T_0) = c_p multiplied by (310 Kelvin minus 243.15 Kelvin) = 97.43 kilojoules per kilogram  

Expression for entropy difference:  
s_6 minus s_0 = integral from T_0 to T_6 of c_p divided by T dt minus R multiplied by ln(p_6 divided by p_0)  

Simplified entropy difference:  
s_6 minus s_0 = ln(T_6 divided by T_0) multiplied by c_p minus R multiplied by ln(p_6 divided by p_0) = ln(310 Kelvin divided by 243.15 Kelvin) multiplied by 1.006 minus 0.287 = 0.337 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  

Final exergy difference:  
Delta ex_str = 97.43 minus 243.15 multiplied by (0.337) plus (510 squared minus 200 squared divided by 2) = 110 megawatts (110.085 megawatts)
