A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "S [kJ/kgÂ·K]". The graph represents a thermodynamic process for an ideal fluid.  
- The curve starts at point "1" labeled as "irreversible".  
- It moves to point "2", then to point "3" labeled as "isobar".  
- From point "3", it transitions to point "4" labeled as "reversible".  
- The curve ends at point "6", with "p4 = p5" and "p0 = p6" noted.
