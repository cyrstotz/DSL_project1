P times V equals m times R times T.  

R equals R divided by M sub g equals 8.314 kilojoules per kilomole per kelvin divided by 50 kilograms per kilomole equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kelvin.  

P sub g equals 1 bar plus (F divided by A) equals 1 bar plus 32 kilograms times 9.81 meters per second squared divided by (pi times (10 centimeters divided by 2) squared).  

Equals 1 bar plus 0.396 equals 1.4 bar.  

m sub g equals R times T divided by P times V equals 0.16628 kilojoules per kelvin times 500 degrees Celsius divided by 1.46 bar times 3.14 equals 2.92 grams.
