Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. Diagram labeled "i" shows a pressure-temperature (P-T) graph with labeled regions.  
   - The graph includes a curve labeled "Gas" and another labeled "Flüssig" (liquid).  
   - States 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked along the curve.  
   - A note reads: "Alle Zustände sind im Dreiphasengebiet" (All states are in the three-phase region).  

2. Diagram labeled "ii" shows another P-T graph.  
   - The graph includes a curve labeled "Flüssig" (liquid) and "Gas."  
   - States 1 and 2 are marked.  
   - A note reads: "ΔT = 10K."
