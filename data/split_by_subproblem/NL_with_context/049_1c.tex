Using entropy balance, we have:  
Sum of Q divided by T plus S erz equals S out minus S in.  
This implies S erz equals Q out divided by T minus m times (S out minus S in).  

Where S out and S in are interpolated from Table A-2:  
S in equals x D times S fg (T equals 70) plus (1 minus x D) times S f (T equals 70) equals 0.58859.  
S out equals x D times S fg (T equals 100) plus (1 minus x D) times S f (T equals 100) equals 1.33719.  

Thus, S erz equals negative (62.299 divided by 288) plus 0.3 times (1.33719 minus 0.58859) approximately equals **211.18 kJ/kg**.
