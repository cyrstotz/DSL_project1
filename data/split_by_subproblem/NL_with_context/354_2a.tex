A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T" (temperature) and the x-axis labeled as "S" (entropy). The graph represents a thermodynamic process with several labeled points:  
- Point 0 at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 slightly higher on the curve.  
- Point 2 at the peak of the curve.  
- Point 3 descending from the peak.  
- Point 4 further down the curve.  
- Point 6 near the bottom right.  

The graph includes isobars labeled as:  
- P0 = P6 (horizontal line at the bottom).  
- P1 (line near point 1).  
- P3 (line near point 3).
