\( x_{text{Ice},2} > 0 \)  

Given \( T_{g,2} \) and \( p_{g,2} \):  

\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \) since the water is incompressible and the ice melting leads to no volume change. The EW is therefore isochoric, and equation (1) from part (a) is valid for part (b).  

\( \Rightarrow T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)^{n-1} \)  

\( \Rightarrow T_{g,2} = T_{g,1} \left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)^{n-1} \)  

\( p_{2,g} V_{g,2} = m_{g} R T_{g,2} \Rightarrow V_{g,2} = \frac{m_{g} R T_{g,2}}{p_{2,g}} \)
