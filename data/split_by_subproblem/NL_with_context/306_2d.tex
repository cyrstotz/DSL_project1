Second law of thermodynamics, stationary, adiabatic  

Q equals s zero minus s six plus entropy production rate (S erz)  
=> entropy production rate (S erz) equals s six minus s zero  

Entropy production rate (S erz) equals c p Luft multiplied by natural logarithm of (T six divided by T zero) minus R h multiplied by natural logarithm of (p six divided by p zero)  

Entropy production rate (S erz) equals 1.006 multiplied by natural logarithm of (298.15 divided by 243.15) minus 0.3 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin  

=> Equivalent exergy equals T zero multiplied by entropy production rate (S erz) equals 73.27 kilowatts per kilogram
