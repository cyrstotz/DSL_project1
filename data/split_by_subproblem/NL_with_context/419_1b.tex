T KF equals integral from s in to s out of T d s divided by s out minus s in.  

T KF equals h out minus h in divided by s out minus s in equals g p times (h out minus h in) plus v times (p out minus p in) divided by g p times ln of (T out divided by T in).  

T KF equals T out minus T in divided by ln of (T out divided by T in) equals 293.75 Kelvin.
