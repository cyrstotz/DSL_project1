p equals F divided by A, where F equals p atmos plus g times (m K plus m EW).  
r equals 5 times pi times m K equals 32 kilograms divided by m EW equals 0.1 kilograms, g equals 9.81 meters per second squared.  
pi squared equals 0.05 meters squared.  

p equals 1 times 10 to the power of 5 newtons per meter squared plus 9.81 times (32 kilograms divided by 0.05 meters squared) equals 41100541.91 pascals equals 4.1 bar.  

p times V equals n times R times T.  

n equals p times V divided by R times T equals 4.1 times 3.14 divided by 8.314 joules per mole kelvin times 773.15 kelvin equals 6.839 times 10 to the power of minus 2 moles.  

m equals 50 grams per mole times 6.839 times 10 to the power of minus 2 equals 3.4193 grams equals 3.42 grams.
