The equation for heat transfer is written as:  
Q dot subscript K equals m dot times [h subscript e minus h subscript a].  

Another equation is written:  
Q dot subscript K equals m dot times [h subscript 2 minus h subscript 1].  

Below this, there is a calculation for h values:  
h subscript 2 equals (h subscript 1).
