Since the ice is not completely melted, the heat transfer \( Q \) is zero because the temperature remains constant.  

The temperature and pressure must decrease since heat is removed.  

Gas and ice are in thermodynamic equilibrium: \( Q = 0 \).  

At \( T = 0^\circ \text{C} \), the gas must have the same temperature as the ice-water mixture (0Â°C), otherwise no ice would remain, and the system would not be in equilibrium.  

\( \frac{p_1 \cdot V_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2 \cdot V_2}{T_2} \)  

\( T_2 = 273.15 \, \text{K} \), \( p_2 = 0.49 \, \text{bar} \)

T2 divided by T1 equals (p2 divided by p1) raised to the power of (0.26317 divided by 0.2837).  
p2 equals p1.  

Result: p2 equals p1.  
"Based on the pressure through p0 and mass, nothing has changed."
