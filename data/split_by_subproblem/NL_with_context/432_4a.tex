A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points and lines:  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 with a downward arrow labeled "isobar".  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 with an upward arrow.  
- Point 3 is connected to point 3' with a horizontal line labeled "isobar".  
- Point 3' is connected back to point 1 with a curved line.
