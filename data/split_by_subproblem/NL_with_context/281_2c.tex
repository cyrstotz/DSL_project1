Mass-specific increase in flow exergy at state 6 equals mass-specific flow exergy at state 0 plus the difference between internal energy at state 6 and state 0 minus the product of surrounding temperature and the difference in entropy at state 6 and state 0 plus one-half times velocity at state 6 squared.
