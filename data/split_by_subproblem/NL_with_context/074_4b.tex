From Table A11:  
h₁ (8°C, x = 0) = 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram = h₁  

h₂ (-16°C, x = 1) = 240.15 kilojoules per kilogram  

T₁ = -16°C - 0°C = -16°C  

---

Stationary flow process:  

0 = ṁ [h₁ - h₂] + Q̇ - Ẇ  

0 = ṁ [h₁ - h₂]

A table is labeled "Kühlkreislauf" (cooling cycle) with the following columns:  
- Zustand (state)  
- p (pressure)  
- h_q (enthalpy)  

The rows are filled as follows:  
1. p0  
2. p1 -16 degrees Celsius (circled), with an arrow pointing to "x1 = 1".  
3. 8 bar  
4. 8 bar, with an arrow pointing to "x4 = 0 h_q".  

Below the table:  
Ti = -20 degrees Celsius (aus Diagramm) (from diagram).
