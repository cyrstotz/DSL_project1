dS/dt of the system equals the sum of m dot_i s_i in minus the sum of m dot_e s_e out plus Q dot divided by T plus S dot_erz.  

0 equals Q dot_KF divided by T_KF plus Q dot_R divided by T_Reactor plus S dot_erz.  

S dot_erz equals Q dot_KF multiplied by (1 divided by T_KF minus 1 divided by T_Reactor).  

S dot_erz equals 0.0455 kilowatts per Kelvin.
