T-s Diagram  

A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]". The diagram includes six points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 connected by lines. The transitions between the points are marked with arrows.  

0 → 1: adiabatic → isentropic / compressor  
s_1 = s_0  
p_1 > p_0  
T_1 > T_0  

1 → 2: adiabatic → rev → isentropic  
s_1 = s_2  

1 → 5: rev mix → isentropic / p_5 = p_0 isobar  

2 → 3: isobar  

3 → 9: nicht rev

Open parenthesis p subscript d divided by v subscript o close parenthesis plus delta k plus open parenthesis open parenthesis c squared minus c subscript o squared close parenthesis divided by two close parenthesis minus delta v divided by v subscript o close parenthesis equals negative 45 times x subscript o squared.  

Delta S equals m times g.
