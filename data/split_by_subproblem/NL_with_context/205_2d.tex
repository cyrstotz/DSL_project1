The equation for the coefficient of performance (COP) is written:  
COP equals heat flow divided by work input.  

The following values are provided:  
- Surrounding temperature \( T_0 \) equals 100 kJ/kg.  
- Exergy loss equals 100.592 kJ.  

Additional notes mention "Gleichung" (equation) and "Laufzeit Verdicht" (compression runtime).
