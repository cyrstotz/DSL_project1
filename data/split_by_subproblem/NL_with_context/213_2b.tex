Energy balance:  
m dot times (h subscript s minus h subscript 6 plus one-half times w subscript s squared minus k subscript e6) equals 0.  

Further equations and annotations:  
- T subscript 6 divided by T subscript 5 equals (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n.  
- T subscript 6 equals (p subscript 6 divided by p subscript 5) raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by n times T subscript 5 equals 328.0747 Kelvin.  

h subscript s minus h subscript 6 plus one-half times w subscript s squared minus one-half times w subscript 6 squared equals 0.  

w subscript 6 squared equals 2 times (h subscript s minus h subscript 6) plus w subscript s squared.  

w subscript 6 equals the square root of 2 times c subscript p times (T subscript 5 minus T subscript 6) plus w subscript s squared equals the square root of 2 times 1.006 times (431.9 minus 328.0747) plus 220 squared equals 507.25 meters per second.
