The coefficient of performance (COP) is calculated using:  
Heat flow in divided by work flow equals heat flow in divided by (heat flow out minus heat flow in).  
This applies to cooling machines.  

In our case:  
Heat flow removed divided by (heat flow added minus heat flow removed) gives us the COP.
