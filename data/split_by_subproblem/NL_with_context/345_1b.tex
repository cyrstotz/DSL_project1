Sum T divided by S equals delta H divided by W multiplied by P.  
Sum T divided by S equals s2 minus s1.  
s2 minus s1 equals ln multiplied by h2 minus h1.  
Sum T divided by S equals c multiplied by ln multiplied by T2 divided by T1.  
Sum T divided by S equals c multiplied by (T2 minus T1).  
T equals T1 minus c divided by ln multiplied by T2 divided by T1.  
T equals 203.72 Kelvin.
