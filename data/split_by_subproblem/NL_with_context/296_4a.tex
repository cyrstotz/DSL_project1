A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes a curve labeled "Isotherm" and a point labeled "Tripel" (Triple Point). Two states are marked:  
- State 1 is connected to State 2 with a vertical line labeled "HÃ¶her" (Higher).  
- State 2 is on the curve labeled "Isotherm."
