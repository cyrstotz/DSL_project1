a) \( Q_{out} \)  

Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. A rectangular box labeled "KF2" on the left and "KF1" on the right, with arrows indicating inlet and outlet flows. The top arrow is labeled "1, w" and the bottom arrow is labeled "2, w".  
2. A similar rectangular box with arrows labeled "h_{aw}" and "h_{zw}" for inlet and outlet flows, and a heat flow \( \dot{Q}_{out} \) indicated inside the box.  

Equation:  
dE/dt = 0 = \( \dot{m} \) (h_{zw} - h_{aw}) + \( \dot{Q}_{out} \)  

h_{aw} (70°C, x = 1)  
h_{zw} (100°C, x = 1)  

\( Q_{out} \) = \( \dot{m} \) (h_{zw} - h_{aw})
