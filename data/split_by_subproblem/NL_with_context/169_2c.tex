Delta e_x,str equals h_0 minus h_6 minus T_0 multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0) plus Delta ke.  
This equals (h_0 minus h_6 minus T_c multiplied by (s_6 minus s_0)) plus (w_6 squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2).  

h_0 minus h_6 equals c_p multiplied by (T_0 minus T_6) equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin multiplied by (243.15 Kelvin minus 340 Kelvin).  

T_c equals minus 30 plus 273.15 equals 243.15 Kelvin.  

h_0 minus h_6 approximately equals minus 97.43 kilojoules per kilogram.  

s_0 minus s_6 equals 0, since the process is adiabatic and reversible.  

Therefore, Delta e_x,str equals (h_0 minus h_6 plus (w_6 squared minus w_0 squared divided by 2)).  

This equals (minus 97.43 kilojoules per kilogram plus (200 squared meters per second squared minus 510 squared meters per second squared divided by 2)).  

This equals (minus 97.43 kilojoules per kilogram plus (200 squared meters per second squared divided by 2 minus 510 squared meters per second squared divided by 2)).  

Approximately equals plus 207.48 kilojoules per kilogram.
