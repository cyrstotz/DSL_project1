A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as 'T [K]' and the x-axis labeled as 'S [kJ/kgÂ·K]'. The graph represents a T-s diagram with several labeled points and curves:  
- Point 0 is at the origin.  
- Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the curves.  
- A vertical line connects points 2 and 3.  
- Isobars are labeled:  
  - \( P_2 = P_3 \)  
  - \( P_4 = P_5 = P_1 = 0.5 \, \text{bar} \)  
  - \( P_0 = P_6 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
- The curve between points 5 and 6 is labeled as 'isobaren'.  
- The curve between points 0 and 1 is labeled as 'vertikal'.
