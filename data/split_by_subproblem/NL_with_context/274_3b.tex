\( T_{g,2} \), \( p_{g,2} \)  

\( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \), as the mass on the piston does not change. The volume of EW remains constant. The gas compresses, resulting in higher pressure but lower temperature.  

\( T_{g,2} = \frac{p_{g,2} V_{g,2}}{m_g R} \)  

\( p V^n = p' V'^n \)  

\( \text{Isobar: } v = v' \)  

\( V_2 = \frac{R T_g}{p} = 3.14 \times 10^{-3} \)
