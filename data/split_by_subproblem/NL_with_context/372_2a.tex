A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T [K]" and the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kg]". The graph represents a thermodynamic process with six labeled points:  
- Point 0 is at the origin.  
- Point 1 is connected to Point 2 with an upward curve labeled "isentropic".  
- Point 2 is connected to Point 3 with a horizontal line labeled "p2 = p3".  
- Point 3 is connected to Point 4 with a downward curve labeled "isentropic".  
- Point 4 is connected to Point 5 with a horizontal line labeled "p4 = p5".  
- Point 5 is connected to Point 6 with a downward curve labeled "isentropic".
