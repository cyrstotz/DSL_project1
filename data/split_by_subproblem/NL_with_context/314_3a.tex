p_g1 = m_g divided by V_g1 = 37.4 kilograms divided by 3.14 liters = 1.191 bar  
p_g1 = p_amb + m_g divided by V_g1 multiplied by R divided by M_g multiplied by T_g1 = 1 bar + 1254.05 Pascal  

m_g = p_g1 multiplied by V_g1 divided by R divided by T_g1 multiplied by M_g = 0.003 kilograms divided by R multiplied by 0.163 kilograms divided by M_g = 3.42 grams
