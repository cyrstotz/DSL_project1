A graph is drawn with labeled axes:  
- The x-axis is labeled as "s" (entropy).  
- The y-axis is labeled as "logic".  

The graph includes several curves and points:  
- Point 1 is labeled as "isobaric".  
- Point 2 is labeled as "isentropic".  
- Point 3 is labeled as "adiabatic".  
- Point 4 is labeled as "p4 = p5".  
- Point 5 is labeled as "p5 = p3".  
- Point 6 is labeled as "p0 = p6".
