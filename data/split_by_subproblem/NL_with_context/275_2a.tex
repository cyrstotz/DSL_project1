\( T_0 = 263.15 \, \text{K} \)  
\( p_0 = 0.191 \, \text{bar} \)  
\( \frac{\dot{m}_M}{\dot{m}_K} = 5.293 \)  
\( c_p = 1.006 \, \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \)  
\( k = 1.4 \)  

Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is a T-s diagram with labeled points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The axes are labeled as \( T \) (temperature) in Kelvin on the vertical axis and \( s \) (specific entropy) in \( \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg·K}} \) on the horizontal axis. Isobars are drawn and labeled as \( p_0 \) and \( 0.5 \, \text{bar} \).  
2. The second diagram is another T-s diagram with similar labeled points and isobars. The axes are labeled the same way as the first diagram.
