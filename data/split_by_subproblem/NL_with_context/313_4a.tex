A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a dome-shaped curve labeled as follows:  
- The left side of the curve is labeled "ges채ttigte Fl체ssigkeit" (saturated liquid).  
- The area under the curve is labeled "Nassdampfgebiet" (wet steam region).  
- The right side of the curve is labeled "체berhitzter Dampf" (superheated steam).  
- Points labeled "1", "2", and "3" are marked on the graph, with arrows indicating transitions between them.  
- The temperature axis includes a mark at "-2째C".
