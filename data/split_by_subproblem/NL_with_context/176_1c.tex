O equals m dot KF times (s_e minus s_a) plus Q out divided by T mean plus S erz.  
Arrow leads to O equals 6.33 watts per Kelvin times c_if times natural logarithm of T KF out divided by T KF in plus 63.3 watts divided by 293.12 Kelvin plus S erz.  
O equals 6.33 watts per Kelvin times natural logarithm of 288.15 Kelvin divided by 278.15 Kelvin plus 63.3 watts divided by 293.12 Kelvin plus S erz.  
Arrow leads to S erz equals 0 because there is no pressure drop.
