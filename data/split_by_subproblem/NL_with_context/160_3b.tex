\( x_{Eis,2} > 0 \)  
\( x_{Eis,1} = \frac{m_{Eis}}{m_{EW}} = 0.6 \)  

\( m_{Eis} = 0.6 \cdot m_{EW} = 0.06 \, \text{kg} \)  

Gas and EW Thermodynamics:  
Because the densities of ice and water are equal, the mass (and volume) of the ice-water mixture does not change. From the KGW, it can be seen that \( p_{g,2} = p_{g,1} \).  

\( p_{g,2} = 1.4 \, \text{bar} \)
