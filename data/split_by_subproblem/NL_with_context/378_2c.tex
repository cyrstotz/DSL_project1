Exergy increase between states 0 and 6:  
Delta ex_str = w_ex_str,0 + (h_6 - h_0) - T_0 * (s_6 - s_0) + V_6 squared divided by 2.  

Calculation:  
cp * (T_6 - T_0) - T_0 * (cp * ln(T_6 divided by T_0)) - R * ln(p_6 divided by p_0) + V_6 squared divided by 2.  

Values:  
85.469 kJ/kg - 73.272 kJ/kg + 128.448 kJ/kg = 136.605 kJ/kg.  

Result:  
Delta ex_str = 136.605 kJ/kg.
