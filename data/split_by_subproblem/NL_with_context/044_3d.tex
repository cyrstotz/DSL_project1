The heat transfer between the gas and the ice-water mixture is completely absorbed as \( Q_{12} \).  

\( m_E \cdot (u_2 - u_1) = Q_{12} \)  

\( u_2 - u_1 = \frac{Q_{12}}{m_E} \) â†’ \( u_2 = \frac{Q_{12}}{m_E} + u_1 \)  

With \( u_1 = x_E \cdot u_{FE} + (1 - x_E) \cdot u_{FE} \),  

\( = -200.1 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

Since \( T \) does not change, the process is isobaric.  

This gives \( u_2 = x_{E,2} \cdot u_{FE} + (1 - x_{E,2}) \cdot u_{FE} \).  

\( u_2 = 2500 \, \text{kJ/kg} + u_1 = \text{approx.} -128.3 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).  

\( x_{E,2} = \frac{(u_2 - u_{FE})}{(u_{FE} - u_{FE})} = 0.555 \).
