The equation is written:  
Q equals m dot R times (h2 minus h3) plus Q23 minus W dot K.  

Additional notes:  
h3 at 8 bar and x3 equals 1 is equal to hg at 8 bar, which equals 93.42 kilojoules per kilogram.  
x3 equals 1 because isentropic compression.  

s3f equals s3f equals 0.385 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin because isentropic.  

h2 equals ... (unfinished).
