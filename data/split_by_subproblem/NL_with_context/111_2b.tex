Energy balance for the jet engine:  
Stationary implies:  
0 equals m dot total multiplied by [h zero minus h six plus (w zero squared minus w six squared) divided by 2] plus Q B minus m dot mantle.  

Adiabatic reversible nozzle implies isentropic.  
Polytropic relation:  
T six divided by T five equals [(p six divided by p five) raised to the power of (kappa minus 1 divided by kappa)].  

This gives:  
T six equals 431.9 multiplied by (0.191 divided by 0.5) raised to the power of 0.4 divided by 1.4 equals 328.75 Kelvin.  

(I) implies:  
Q equals m dot total multiplied by h total.

Energy balance for the nozzle:  
Stationary implies:  
0 equals m dot total multiplied by [h five minus h six plus (w six squared minus w five squared) divided by 2] plus delta Q adiabatic minus summation of delta W zero nozzle (nozzle presumably does no work).  

For ideal gas:  
h equals c p multiplied by (T five minus T six) plus (w six squared minus w five squared) divided by 2.  

This gives:  
w six squared equals 2 multiplied by c p multiplied by (T five minus T six) plus w five squared.  

w six equals square root of [2 multiplied by 1.006 multiplied by (431.9 minus 328.75) multiplied by 10 raised to the power of 3 plus 220 squared].  

w six equals 457.29 meters per second.  

w six equals 507.24 meters per second.
