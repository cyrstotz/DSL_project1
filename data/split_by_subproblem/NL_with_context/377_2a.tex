A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "s [kJ/kg·K]" and the y-axis labeled as "T [K]". The graph shows a thermodynamic process with points labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- Point 0 is at the origin and labeled with "p₀".  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 by a curve labeled "adiabatic".  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 by a curve labeled "isobar".  
- Point 3 is connected to point 4 by a curve labeled "p₅ = 0.5 bar".  
- Point 4 is connected to point 5 by a curve labeled "isobar".  
- Point 5 is connected to point 6 by a curve labeled "adiabatic reversible".  
- Point 6 is labeled "p₆ = 0.5 bar".  

A small sketch in the corner shows a generic thermodynamic cycle labeled "isobar", "adiabatic", and "isotherm".
