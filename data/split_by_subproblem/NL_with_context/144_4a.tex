A graph is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled `[p]` (pressure).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled `T [K]` (temperature in Kelvin).  

The graph shows a cycle with four states labeled `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.  
- Between states `1` and `2`, the region is labeled `Nass-Dampf` (wet vapor).  
- Between states `2` and `3`, the curve is labeled `isobar`.  
- Between states `3` and `4`, the curve is labeled `isobar`.  
- Between states `4` and `1`, the curve returns to the wet vapor region.
