Entropy balance must be used:  
O equals the sum of Q dot divided by T s plus S dot erz.  

A diagram is shown with arrows labeled as follows:  
- \( T_{KF,in} \) pointing into the box.  
- \( T_{KF,out} \) pointing out of the box.  
- \( Q_{aus} \) pointing upward from the box.  
- \( T_{aus} \) pointing to the right.
