The equation is given as:  
Q12 equals m multiplied by (U2 minus U1).  

U2 is calculated as:  
Q12 divided by m plus U1.  

Substituting values:  
1500 joules divided by 0.1 kilograms plus negative 133.1262 kilojoules per kilogram.  

This results in:  
negative 118.1262 kilojoules per kilogram.  

U1 is calculated as:  
negative 333.458 plus 0.6 multiplied by (negative 0.0015 minus negative 333.458) using Table 1.  

This simplifies to:  
negative 133.1262 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Interpolation with EW Table 1 at T equals 0.003 degrees Celsius:  

x equals (U2 minus Utest) divided by (Ufussig minus Utest), which equals 0.645.
