Energy balance equation for the reactor:  
0 equals m dot in multiplied by (h in minus h out) plus Q dot R.  

Q dot R equals m dot multiplied by (h out minus h in), which equals 0.3 kilograms per second multiplied by (1407.6 kilojoules per kilogram minus 1269.7 kilojoules per kilogram), resulting in 42.18 kilowatts.  

Q dot out equals Q dot R minus Q dot R, which equals 100 kilowatts minus 42.18 kilowatts, resulting in 57.82 kilowatts.  

Substance properties from Table A3 (saturated liquid):  
h in equals h at 70 degrees Celsius, which equals 1269.7 kilojoules per kilogram.  
h out equals h at 100 degrees Celsius, which equals 1407.6 kilojoules per kilogram.
