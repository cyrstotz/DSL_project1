A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph shows a dome-shaped curve labeled with phase regions. Key points and processes are marked:  
- Point 4: "mass dampf" (mass vapor).  
- "Isobar Kondensat" (isobaric condensation) is shown as a horizontal line from point 4 to point 3.  
- Point 3: "isobar vollst√§ndige Verdampfung" (isobaric complete evaporation).  
- Point 2: "adiabatic und reversibel (isentrop) Verdichtung" (adiabatic and reversible (isentropic) compression).  
- Point 1: "ND Gebiet" (low-pressure region).  
- "adiabatic Drosselung" (adiabatic throttling) is shown as a vertical line from point 3 to point 1.
