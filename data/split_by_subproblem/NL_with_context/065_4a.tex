A graph is drawn with pressure (p) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph represents a phase diagram with labeled regions:  
- "Fl√ºssigebiet" (Liquid region) on the left.  
- "Mischgebiet" (Mixture region) in the middle.  
- "Dampfgebiet" (Vapor region) on the right.  
The curve includes a critical point labeled "kritischer Punkt" at the top.  
Four states are marked on the diagram:  
- State 1 in the mixture region.  
- State 2 in the vapor region.  
- State 3 in the vapor region.  
- State 4 in the liquid region.  
Yellow lines connect states 1 to 2 and states 3 to 4, representing transitions.
