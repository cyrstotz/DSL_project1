A graph is drawn with labeled axes: entropy (s) on the x-axis and temperature (T) on the y-axis. Several curves are shown, representing different processes:  
- Isobaric lines labeled as \( p_0, p_6 \).  
- Adiabatic lines labeled as \( s = \text{constant} \).  
- Points labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, connected by arrows indicating transitions between states.  
- A return path is marked.
