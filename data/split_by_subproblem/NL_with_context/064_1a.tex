Q equals m dot times (h in minus h out) plus integral from T1 to T2 of c(T) dT plus v squared divided by two times (p2 minus p1).  

Q out equals m dot times (h out minus h in) equals 0.3 times m dot times integral from T1 to T2 of c(T) dT plus v squared divided by two times (p2 minus p1).  

Q equals 0.3 times (191.04 minus 29.248) equals 62,182 W.  

h out equals 191.04 kJ/kg, h in equals 29.248 kJ/kg, table A-2.
