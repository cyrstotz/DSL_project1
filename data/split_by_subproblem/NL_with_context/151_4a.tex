A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "T [°C]" and the y-axis labeled as "p [bar]". The graph includes a curve representing phase regions, with annotations for different states and processes:  
- "isobar" is marked horizontally.  
- "isotherm" is marked vertically.  
- Points labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4" are connected by arrows indicating transitions.  
- The region is divided into "flüssig" (liquid) and "gas" (gas).  
- A label "6K" is written near the transition between states.
