A rectangular diagram is drawn with arrows pointing into and out of the rectangle, labeled as 0 → 6.  

An equation is written:  
O equals m-dot times (h0 minus h6 plus w0 squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2) plus Q-dot16 minus L-dot16.  

Another equation is written:  
O equals m-dot times (h5 minus h6 plus w5 squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2) plus Q-dotSG minus L-dotSG.  

A schematic of a nozzle is drawn, labeled as 5 → 6.
