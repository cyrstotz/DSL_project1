A table is presented with the following columns: P, T, S, and U. The rows are labeled with \( x_1 = 1 \), \( x_2 = 1 \), \( x_3 = 0 \), and \( x_4 = 0 \). The entries are as follows:  

- \( x_1 = 1 \):  
  - P: 2268  
  - T: -6  
  - S: 20415  
  - U: 26218, 93.42  

- \( x_2 = 1 \):  
  - P: 2268  
  - T: 11  
  - S: 11  
  - U: (blank)  

- \( x_3 = 0 \):  
  - P: 8  
  - T: 8  
  - S: (blank)  
  - U: (blank)  

- \( x_4 = 0 \):  
  - P: 8  
  - T: 8  
  - S: (blank)  
  - U: 26725, 93.42  

Below the table, a graph is drawn with axes labeled P (pressure) and T (temperature). The graph shows a curve labeled with the following points:  

- Point 1: Marked with an asterisk and labeled "isod".  
- Point 4: Labeled "iso".  
- Point 3: Labeled "iso".  

The curve connects these points, showing a process diagram.
