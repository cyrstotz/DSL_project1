Delta exergy equals exergy at state six minus exergy at state zero.  

Delta exergy equals mass flow rate multiplied by (enthalpy at state six minus enthalpy at state zero minus temperature at state zero multiplied by (entropy at state six minus entropy at state zero) plus kinetic energy).  

Specific enthalpy difference:  
h six minus h zero equals specific heat capacity multiplied by (temperature at state six minus temperature at state zero).  
Specific heat capacity equals 1.006 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  
Temperature difference equals 431.9 minus 243.75 Kelvin.  
h six minus h zero equals 85.435 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Specific entropy difference:  
s six minus s zero equals specific heat capacity multiplied by the natural logarithm of (temperature at state six divided by temperature at state zero) minus gas constant divided by the polytropic exponent multiplied by the natural logarithm of (pressure at state six divided by pressure at state zero).  
s six minus s zero equals 0.301 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.  

Kinetic energy difference:  
w six squared minus w zero squared divided by two equals 220 squared minus 200 squared divided by two.  

Delta exergy equals 85.435 minus (243.75 multiplied by 0.301) plus (220 squared minus 200 squared divided by two).  

Delta exergy equals 42.887 plus 110.062 kilojoules per kilogram.
