Zero equals negative Delta ex_str plus (1 minus T_0 divided by T) times Q dot divided by m_gs minus w dot divided by m_gs times ex_vel.  

(1 minus T_0 divided by T) times Q dot divided by m_gs equals 159.073 kilojoules per kilogram.  

Q dot divided by m_gs equals 189.89 kilojoules per kilogram.  

m_K equals m_gs minus m_K divided by m_gs equals 5.293.  

m_K equals m_gs divided by 5.293 plus 1 equals m_gs divided by 6.293.  

ex_vel equals negative Delta ex_str plus (1 minus T_0 divided by T) times Q dot divided by m_gs equals 250.286 (crossed out).  

equals 57.886 kilojoules per kilogram (underlined).
