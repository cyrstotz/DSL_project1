The pressure in the gas remains constant because the weight pressing down is unchanged.  

p subscript g2 equals p subscript g1 equals 1.4009 bar.  

T subscript g2 equals T subscript EW2 equals equilibrium.  

Since ice is still present in the two-phase area and the water is at constant temperature, the pressure does not change. Therefore, the temperature remains constant at 0 degrees Celsius. Since we are in equilibrium, T subscript g2 equals T subscript EW2 equals 0 degrees Celsius.
