Two diagrams are drawn:  

1. The first diagram is a pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The graph includes labeled isobars and phase regions.  
   - Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are marked on the graph.  
   - The region between points 1 and 2 is labeled "x = 0" (indicating saturated liquid).  
   - The region between points 2 and 3 is labeled "x = 1" (indicating saturated vapor).  
   - The isobar labeled "p = 5 bar" is drawn horizontally across the graph.  

2. The second diagram is another pressure-temperature (p-T) graph.  
   - The graph includes an isobar labeled "isobar = 8 bar."  
   - Points 1, 2, and 3 are marked on the graph.  
   - The region between points 1 and 2 is labeled "x = 0" (saturated liquid).  
   - The region between points 2 and 3 is labeled "x = 1" (saturated vapor).
