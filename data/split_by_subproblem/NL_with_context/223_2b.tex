Energy balance for jet engine (system boundary is the entire engine):  
dE/dt = m dot times (h0 minus h6 plus w velocity squared divided by 2 minus w6 squared divided by 2) plus summation of Q dot i minus summation of W dot i  

- w6 squared equals 2 times h0 minus 2 times h6 plus w velocity squared.  
- Integral of Cp dT from T0 to T6.  
- To determine T6:  
  T6 equals T5 times (P0 divided by P5) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4).  

Calculation:  
T6 equals 431.5 K times (0.191 divided by 0.15) raised to the power of (1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4), equals 328.08747 K.  

h0 minus h6 equals Cp times (743.15 K minus 328.08747 K), equals minus 85.134 kJ/kg.  

w6 equals square root of 2 times (minus 85.134) plus 200 meters per second squared.
