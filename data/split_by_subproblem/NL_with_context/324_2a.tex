A T-s diagram is drawn with labeled isobars and states.  
- The x-axis is labeled as 's (kJ/kg·K) [kJ/kg·K]'.  
- The y-axis is labeled as 'T (K)'.  
- States 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are marked along the process path.  
- Arrows indicate the direction of the process.  
- The isobars are labeled as p0, p1, p2, and p3.  
- The process path includes a reversible nozzle and other transitions.
