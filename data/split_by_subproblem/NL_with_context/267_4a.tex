Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is labeled with axes \( P \) [kPa] and \( T \) [°C]. It shows phase regions labeled "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous). The triple point is marked, and arrows indicate transitions between states 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
2. The second diagram is similarly labeled with axes \( P \) [kPa] and \( T \) [°C]. It also shows the phase regions "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous), with the triple point marked. Arrows indicate transitions between states 2 and 3.
