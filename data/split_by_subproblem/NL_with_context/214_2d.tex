O equals mass flow rate times exergy specific at state 6 minus h minus mass flow rate times exergy loss plus (one minus T0 divided by TB) times 1195 times mass flow rate.  

exergy loss equals exergy specific plus (one minus T0 divided by TB) times 1195 kilojoules per kilogram.  
equals 1075.05 kilojoules per kilogram.
