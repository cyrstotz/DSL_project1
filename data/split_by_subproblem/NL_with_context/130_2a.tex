A graph is drawn with the y-axis labeled as "T (k)" and the x-axis labeled as "s (kJ/kgÂ·K)". The graph shows several curves and points labeled as follows:  
- Point 0 is at the bottom left.  
- Point 1 is connected to point 2 by a curve.  
- Point 2 is connected to point 3 by another curve.  
- Point 3 is connected to point 4 by a curve.  
- Point 4 is connected to point 5 by another curve.  
- Point 5 is connected to point 6 by a curve.  

The graph includes dashed lines representing isobars.  

Below the graph, the following equations are written:  

\( \dot{m} \cdot (h_e - h_a + \frac{1}{2} w_e^2 - \frac{1}{2} w_a^2) = 0 \)  

\( h_a = h_e = c_p (T_2 - T_1) = 1.006 \cdot (T_6 - T_5) \)  

\( T_6 = T_5 = p_6 = p_{amb} = 1 \, \text{bar} \)
