Q_12 equals U_12 minus U_02 equals zero.  

Q_12 equals c_V times (T_2 minus T_1) equals (c_p minus R divided by M) times (T_2 minus T_1) equals zero point four six six seven two times (zero point zero zero three six six six divided by fifty) times (T_2 minus five hundred) equals minus two hundred fifty-three point six eight three.  

V_mix equals m times R times T divided by p equals zero point zero zero zero zero two.  

c_V equals c_p minus R divided by M equals zero point four six six seven two.
