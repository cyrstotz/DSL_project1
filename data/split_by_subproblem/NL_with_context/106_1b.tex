0 equals m dot KF times (s KF,e minus s KF,a) plus Q dot aus divided by T KF plus S dot erz.  
0 because no pressure change.  

s KF,e minus s KF,a equals c times ln (T KF,e divided by T KF,a).  

T KF equals negative m dot KF times c times ln (T KF,e divided by T KF,a).  

Q dot aus equals negative m dot KF times c times ln (T KF,e divided by T KF,a).
