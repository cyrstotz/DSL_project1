A graph is drawn with pressure (P) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. The graph includes labeled points and regions:  
- A region labeled "gas" at the top.  
- A horizontal line marked "10K" above the triple point.  
- A point labeled "3.1 mbar" near the triple point.  
- A phase region labeled "Fl√ºssig" (liquid) at the bottom left.  
- Arrows indicating transitions between phases.
