O equals C sub EW. O equals C sub g minus h sub EW.  

p sub 2 equals p sub g,1 equals 1.4 bar, since the weight (CF sub g) remains constant and exerts pressure.  

T sub 2 equals T sub EW,1 equals 0 degrees Celsius, since the heat capacity and mass of water are significantly larger than the enthalpy of fusion.  

If there is still ice, then T sub 2,EW must equal T sub 1,EW.
