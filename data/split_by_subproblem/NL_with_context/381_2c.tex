wc equals the square root of two times m dot g times (cp times (T5 minus T0) plus w5 squared divided by two).

m dot g equals (crossed-out section) m dot k plus m dot m equals m dot k times (1 plus 5.293).

O equals m dot k times (h2 minus h3) plus m dot k times qb.

Negative qb equals (crossed-out section) cp times (T2 minus T3).  
T2 leads to some.

Turbine:  
O equals m dot k times cp times (T1 minus T2) plus Q (crossed-out section) divided by W divided by rev.
