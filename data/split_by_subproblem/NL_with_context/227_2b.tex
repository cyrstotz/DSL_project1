The text reads:  
"5–6 adiabatic and reversible → isentropic"  

A table is drawn with columns labeled "P," "T," and "W." The rows are filled as follows:  
- Row 0: P = 0.191, T = 243.15, W = 200  
- Row 1: (empty)  
- Row 2: (empty)  
- Row 3: (empty)  
- Row 4: (empty)  
- Row 5: P = 0.5, T = 431.9, W = 220  
- Row 6: P = 0.191  

Below the table, the text reads:  
"η_v,s < 1 →"
