A diagram is drawn with labeled axes. The x-axis is labeled as "T [K]" and the y-axis is labeled as "p [bar]". The diagram shows a curve representing the phase regions. Points are labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4, with arrows indicating transitions between these states. The region labeled "MD - KÃ¼hlt" (cooling) is marked, and the curve includes annotations such as "isobar" and "isentrop". The diagram visually represents the freeze-drying process.
