T2 equals negative twenty-two degrees Celsius.  

s2 equals sf plus x multiplied by (sg minus sf).  

x equals (s2 minus sf) divided by (sg minus sf).  

s3 equals s2 because compression is isentropic.  

s2 was determined through interpolation between 20 and... [text ends abruptly].  

Drossel is isenthalpic.  

u7 equals u2.  

u4 equals ninety-three point forty-two kilojoules per kilogram.  

u equals uf plus x multiplied by (sg minus sf).  

x equals (u minus uf) divided by (ug minus uf).  

uf and ug are at the outlet pressure.
