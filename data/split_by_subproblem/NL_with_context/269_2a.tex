A graph is drawn with the title "T-s Diagram". The x-axis is labeled as "s [kJ/kg]" and the y-axis is labeled as "T [K]". The graph shows a process with labeled points:  
- Point 0: \( p_0 = p_6 \)  
- Point 5: \( p_5 \)  
- Point 2: \( p_2 = p_3 \)  
Arrows indicate transitions between these points, forming a cycle.
