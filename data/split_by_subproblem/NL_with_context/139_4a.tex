A graph is drawn with the x-axis labeled as "T" (temperature) and the y-axis labeled as "p" (pressure). The graph includes phase regions labeled as "fest" (solid), "flüssig" (liquid), and "gasförmig" (gaseous). There are curves and transitions marked between these regions, with arrows indicating changes. Specific points and transitions are labeled, such as "2" and "4".
