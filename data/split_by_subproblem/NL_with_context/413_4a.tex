A graph is drawn with pressure labeled as "P [Pa]" on the vertical axis and temperature labeled as "T [K]" on the horizontal axis. The graph includes a curve labeled "Tripelpunkt" (triple point), separating the regions "Fehl-Flüssig" (liquid-gas mixture) and "Go" (gas). Above the curve, the region is labeled "überkritisch" (supercritical).
