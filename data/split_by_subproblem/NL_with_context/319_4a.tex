Two diagrams are drawn:  
1. The first diagram is labeled with "p" (pressure) on the vertical axis and "T" (temperature) on the horizontal axis. It shows intersecting curves and regions labeled as "solid," "liquid," and "gas." The text "pin daqs geht nach unten wie in (*) apparent" is written near the diagram.  
2. The second diagram is labeled similarly with "p" on the vertical axis and "T" on the horizontal axis. It includes colored regions and arrows indicating transitions between phases. Labels such as "solid," "liquid," and "gas" are present, along with annotations like "fast," "missing," and "sublimation."
