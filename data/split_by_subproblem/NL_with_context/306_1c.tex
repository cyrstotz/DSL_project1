Second law of thermodynamics:  
S erz equals m dot times (s a minus s e) minus Q out divided by T reactor minus Q out divided by T KF at wall  

S erz equals 1 kilogram per second times 65 kilojoules divided by 373.15 Kelvin plus 65 kilowatts divided by 293.12 Kelvin equals 0.0476 kilowatts per Kelvin equals 49.56 watts per Kelvin
