A graph is drawn with axes labeled as follows:  
- The vertical axis is labeled "T [K]" (temperature in Kelvin).  
- The horizontal axis is labeled "P [bar]" (pressure in bar).  

The graph shows three distinct regions labeled:  
- "Gas" at the top.  
- "Flüssig" (liquid) in the middle.  
- "Fest" (solid) at the bottom.  

A curve is drawn separating the "Gas" and "Flüssig" regions, and another curve separates the "Flüssig" and "Fest" regions.  
Point "1" is marked in the "Flüssig" region, and points "2" and "3" are marked along the curve between "Flüssig" and "Fest."  

Below the graph, the following text is written:  
- "isobar → erst gefrieren → dann sublimiert" (isobar → first freeze → then sublimate).  
- "isotherm" (isothermal).
